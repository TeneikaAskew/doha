He has worked \nfor his current employer since about February 2018. He has been employed full time \nsince about 2013. He was awarded a high school diploma in 1995. He took some \ncommunity college courses but did not earn an associate\u2019s degree. He has been \nmarried and divorced twice. His first marriage was from 2002 until 2005 and his second \nmarriage was from 2009 until 2014. He has resided with a cohabitant since March 2020. \nHe has two children, ages 18 and 12. He served on active duty with the U.S Air Force \nfrom 2001 until 2007 and with the Air Force Reserve from 2007 until 2010. He received \nhonorable discharges from both. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1, 2, 6, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant had not timely filed his \nfederal income tax returns for the 2012 through 2017 and 2019 tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It \nalso alleged that he owed delinquent federal taxes in the following amounts: $8,000 for \nthe 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax years (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $2,758 for the 2013 tax year \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); $7,062 for the 2017 tax year (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and $4,6667 for the 2019 tax \nyear (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Finally, it alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2016 \nthat was discharged in 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). In his Answer, Applicant denied the SOR \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b with additional comment. He admitted the SOR \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.f with additional comment. I have incorporated his \nadmissions as findings of fact. Despite his denial of the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b, those allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s Questionnaires for National \nSecurity Positions he submitted in April 2018 and August 2020, the IRS Account \nTranscripts, and the 2019 and 2020 security interviews. (SOR; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2012 through \n2017 and 2019 tax years despite being required to do so. He also failed to timely file his \n2018 federal income tax return. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such \nas Applicant\u2019s late filing of income tax returns for other tax years cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes, however it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)) In 2017, he asked his sister, who is an income tax filing \nprofessional, to file his income tax returns for the 2012 through 2016 tax years. He \nacknowledged that he had not timely filed his 2012 through 2017 federal income tax \nreturns because he was \u201clazy.\u201d She agreed to file these federal income tax returns for \nhim. However, she never filed Applicant\u2019s 2012 through 2016 income tax returns with \nthe IRS and forgot to tell Applicant about this failure. He was aware that his 2012 \nthrough 2016 federal income tax returns had not been filed by March 2018. He then \ncontacted an acquaintance who helped others file their income tax returns. He asked \nthis acquaintance to help him file his 2013 through 2017 federal income tax returns. (Tr. \n23-27, 37-44, 47-51; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-E) \nApplicant believed that the aforementioned acquaintance filed his federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2013 through 2017, sometime in 2018.

Applicant claimed that \nin 2020, he contacted the IRS in response to this notice. He claimed that, because of \nthis contact with the IRS, he refiled his 2013 through 2017 federal income tax returns in \n2020. He later realized that he had refiled unsigned versions of these returns, and he \nbelieves that the IRS did not process them in 2020 for this reason. (Tr. 23-27, 41, 42-43, \n45-52; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-J) \nApplicant eventually successfully filed his 2013 through 2017 and 2019 federal \nincome tax returns between August 2020 and November 2021. He has yet to file his \n2012 federal income tax return. He claimed that the IRS indicated that he is not required \nto file this income tax return for an unspecified reason. He filed his 2018 federal income \ntax return in March 2022, after it was due. He filed his 2020 federal income tax return in \nSeptember 2021, after it was due. He timely filed his 2021 federal income tax return in \nMarch 2022. He claimed that he was in regular contact with the IRS about his tax filings \nin 2018 and 2021. (Tr. 23-27, 41, 42-43, 45-52; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-J) \nApplicant owed approximately $8,000 in delinquent federal taxes for tax years \n2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. He owed approximately $2,758 in delinquent taxes for the \n2013 tax year. He owed approximately $7,062 in delinquent taxes for the 2017 tax year. \nHe owed approximately $4,667 in delinquent taxes for the 2019 tax year. He also owed \nunspecified delinquent federal taxes for the 2018 and 2020 tax years. In October 2021, \nhe made a written offer to the IRS for a payment arrangement of $300 per month for his \ndelinquent federal taxes for the 2013 through 2019 tax years. In March 2022, the IRS \nacknowledged in writing that he had made a payment arrangement of $450 per month \nfor tax years 2013 through 2019. Applicant paid the delinquent federal taxes for tax \nyears 2013 through 2017 and 2019 from March 2022 through September 2022. As of \nSeptember 2022, these delinquent taxes are paid. He paid his delinquent federal taxes \nfor the 2018 tax year between March and November 2022, when he paid them in full. \nHe paid his delinquent federal taxes for the 2020 tax year between June and September \n2022, when he paid them in full. He paid approximately $30,000 in delinquent taxes. He \nwas able to pay these delinquent taxes with his income. He received a refund for the \n2021 tax year. (Tr. 23-27, 45-48; 53; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-J) \nBy 2018, at the latest, Applicant knew that he owed delinquent taxes. He claimed \nthat he waited until October 2021 to offer to make payment arrangements with the IRS \nbecause he was waiting to receive a bill. He claimed he did not make any payments \nuntil March 2022 because he waited until he had a payment arrangement in place with \nthe IRS. He also stated that part of the reason for his delay in resolving his tax filing and \npayment issues was an IRS backlog and his multiple changes of residences and \nchanges in employment. (Tr. 31-32, 45-50, 53; Answer; GE 1, 2, 6, 7; AE B-J) \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in September 2016.

In March 2017, the bankruptcy judge closed the case without \ngranting a discharge because Applicant had not filed his proof of financial education. \nApplicant completed his required financial management class in April 2018. The judge \nreopened the bankruptcy case in April 2018 and granted Applicant a Chapter 7 \ndischarge that same month. (Tr. 28, 30; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4-7) \nAfter he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, notwithstanding his delinquent federal taxes, \nhe has been mostly current on his other financial responsibilities with several \nexceptions. He was ninety-days delinquent on two student loans in September 2016 \nand July 2017, when he allowed these loans to fall out of a forbearance status. He \nresolved these student loan delinquencies in September 2017, by having them replaced \nin forbearance. He was 30 days late on a small credit-card balance in June 2020, which \nhe paid in full in July 2020. He had two delinquent consumer debts of about $350 each \nthat he resolved in March 2021. (Tr. 28-30, 55; Answer; GE 3-7; AE T) \nApplicant has been working and residing in Country A since May 2022. He is \ncurrently scheduled to work and live there until May 2023, but may continue there until \nMay 2024. He provided pay stubs showing that he has earned between about $3,500 \nand $6,000 in take home pay every two weeks while he works in Country A. He also \nearns additional income of about $11,000 monthly while working in Country A\n . Given his \nability to pay his significant federal tax indebtedness, the lack of delinquencies on the \ncredit reports in the record, his bank account balances, and his testimony to this effect \nat the time of the hearing, he has enough income while working in Country A to meet his \nfinancial obligations and to save money. His parents have indicated their willingness to \nguarantee any of his income tax delinquencies. (Tr. 33-37, 53-54; Answer; GE 5; AE B-\nT) \nApplicant provided character reference letters from individuals who know him \nboth socially and through work. Some of these individuals hold security clearances. All \nattest to his trustworthiness, reliability, professionalism, and discretion involving \nsensitive information. They believe that he should be granted a security clearance. He \nhas completed several training courses relevant to the protection of sensitive \ninformation. (Tr. 31; Answer) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nIn 2016, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition because he was unable \nto meet his financial obligations. Beginning in 2012, he did not timely file federal income \ntax returns for several years, despite being required to do so. He owed significant \ndelinquent federal income taxes for several tax years. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nWhile Applicant has now filed most of his outstanding federal income tax returns, \nhe has not filed his federal income tax return for the 2012 tax year. He has paid his \ndelinquent taxes for tax years 2013 onward. Even if we were to assume for the sake of \nargument that the IRS no longer required him to file his 2012 federal income tax return, \nhe would only have been current on the remainder of his delinquent taxes since \nNovember 2022. When contrasted with the number of years that Applicant has not met \nhis financial obligations, this several-month time period does not constitute a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. Given the lack of evidence relating to his fulfillment of \nfederal tax responsibilities for the 2012 tax year and the lack of a track record of \nfinancial responsibility, I am unable to find that his financial issues are unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns because he was \n\u201clazy,\u201d and did not follow up with his tax preparers and the IRS to insure that they had \nbeen appropriately filed. A degree of ignorance to one\u2019s financial situation may suggest \nan indifference to the proper satisfaction of legal obligations that draws into question \nApplicant\u2019s willingness or capacity to comply with the sometimes complex rules \ngoverning the handling and safeguarding of classified information. ISCR Case No. 18-\n02914 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 18, 2020). He owed delinquent taxes for several years \nbecause he did not timely file his federal income tax returns, because he did not \nwithhold enough income to satisfy his tax obligations, and because he waited for the \nIRS to contact him with a bill. These conditions that caused his tax deficiencies were \nlargely within his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant received financial counseling through the mandatory bankruptcy course \nin 2018. For \u00b6 20(c) to apply, he must also show that there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control. With the exception of the 2012 tax year, \nhe has filed and paid his delinquent income tax returns and federal taxes. With several \nexceptions, he has stayed current on his consumer financial responsibilities. He has \nshown that while he is working in Country A, he has the income to pay his debts. \nHowever, the aforementioned insignificant period of time in which he has been (mostly) \ndelinquency free detracts from the applicability of this mitigating factor. AG \u00b6 20(c) \npartially applies. \nApplicant has repaid all of his delinquent federal taxes. While he claimed that \nother factors led to the timing of these payments, he made them well after his clearance \nprocess began. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeen placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment \nand willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). AG \u00b6 \n20(d) partially applies. \nExcept for the 2012 tax year, Applicant arranged with the IRS to file his \ndelinquent income tax returns and pay his taxes, and complied with these \narrangements. AG \u00b6 20(g) partially applies. \nWhile three of the mitigating conditions partially apply, application of a particular \nmitigating condition does not necessarily establish overall mitigation. Applicant has only \nonce (in 2021) timely filed his federal income tax returns since 2012. This one year of \ncompliance falls short of providing sufficient evidence of reform and rehabilitation. He \nhas not provided sufficient evidence that he filed his 2012 federal income tax return. He \nhas not established a track record of financial responsibility. Overall, he has not met his \nburden of providing mitigating evidence. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character references, his training, and his military service, and I \nhave incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security \nExecutive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant\u2019s initial Answer to the SOR included a typed letter dated February 11, \n2022, and a contact sheet, signed and dated February 15, 2022, in which he elected to \nhave his case decided by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) on the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing.

He was briefly unemployed at the end of 2020 \nwhen that contract ended. Since December 2020, he been sponsored for a clearance by \na new employer, for a job in aviation. (Item 3) In his February 2021 background interview, \nhe indicated that he had not yet begun working for the company, as the job required \ntransfer to Iraq, and he had only recently received a visa. (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s undated response to DOD Interrogatories sent to him in July 2021 \nabout his finances, Applicant references an unspecified \u201chealth setback\u201d in 2018 from \nwhich, he said, he was only then recovering from. (Item 4 at 9). In his Answer, he \nreferenced an unexpected \u201cfinancial loss\u201d in 2018 but he gave no details. In his \nbackground interview, he stated that he tried to start a business as a mechanic and \npurchased tools in order to do so, but the business never materialized. He took no action \non his debts because he believed they had been written off by the creditors. (Item 5) \nThe SOR debts total just under $32,500. The record includes credit bureau reports \n(CBRs) from October 2021 and January 2021 (Items 7, 8), which, along with Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, establish the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \nIn an interrogatory response to the CAF in July 2021, Applicant was asked about \nall five of the debts. He said he had recently made arrangements to pay them, and \nprovided phone numbers for the creditors, but no documents about them. (Item 5 at 9) \nThe debts are detailed as follows. The documents discussed were all provided with \nApplicant\u2019s Answer: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($7,020) and 1.e ($3,398) are accounts that were both charged off by \nthe same financial services company (accounts #1077 and #1012, respectively). \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.a (#1077), which concerns a pickup truck, he provided a settlement \noffer from the company for about $3,510. He provided three checks, apparently from \nFebruary, March, and April 2022, for $1,200, $1,200, and the balance of $1,109.96. \n(Answer) This account is resolved. \nFor SOR \u00b6 1.e (#1012), Applicant provided a February 2022 settlement offer from \nthe company noting that the balance ($1,417) could be settled for a one-time payment of \n$283. Applicant settled the debt with a check in February 2022. (Answer Attachments) \nThis account is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,136) is an account that was charged off by tool company S. \nApplicant provided an October 2021 letter from the creditor referencing a payment \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nschedule of $50 per week to begin in October 2021.

(Answer \nattachment) He appears to indicate in his Answer that the account has been paid, but this \nis not documented. The account is not reflected on a February 2022 credit report provided \nwith the Answer. No subsequent documents are included with Applicant\u2019s Answer so no \npayments are documented.

An earlier \nletter, dated September 10, 2021, shows a balance at that time of $20,875. (Answer \nAttachments) No subsequent documents are included with Applicant\u2019s Answer so no \npayments are documented. This debt was apparently being paid at the time, though the \namount owed (about $20,000) is more than what was alleged. The account is not \nresolved. \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) with his July 2021 \ninterrogatory response. He reported net monthly income of just under $9,800, monthly \nexpenses of $3,135 and a $435 monthly car payment. He did not list any payments for \nhis SOR debts. He listed a net remainder of $3,970. (Item 4) \nApplicant did not disclose any of these delinquent debts on his SCA, but he did \nvolunteer in his February 2021 background interview that he had delinquent debts, mostly \ninvolving a loan and debts to tool companies. He said he did not have information about \nhis debts available when he prepared his SCA, so he could not list any debts. (Item 5 at \n2) He also explained in his Answer that at the time he filled out his SCA, he was recovering \nfrom pneumonia and was hospitalized for a week following a mild heart attack. He was \nnot working at the time. He requests consideration to be allowed to continue his \nemployment and earning income for his family. (Item 2) \nApplicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM, so he did not provide \nupdated documents or other, more recent information regarding any payments towards \nhis debts after February 2022, or any more recent information about his income, \nexpenses, or overall financial stability and ability to address his debts. He did not indicate \nthat he has participated in recent credit counseling or follows a budget (other than his July \n2021 PFS). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise financial security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe five past-due debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and \nby credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 (a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant appears to have incurred his debts when he attempted to start a \nbusiness as a mechanic. Two of the SOR debts are to tool companies. The business did \nnot materialize, and the debts became past-due, placed for collection, or were charged \noff. Two of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e) are resolved through payments on a settlement \noffer. The other, larger debts are not resolved. They are ongoing, and if they were \nresolved that is not established with corroborating documentation from the Applicant. \nSince the delinquencies are ongoing, they continue to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application since the debts appear to result \nfrom a failed business. However, Applicant did not establish that he has taken reasonable \naction under the circumstances to address his debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply and \nit does not mitigate the financial security concerns. Similarly, he has not shown under AG \n\u00b6 20(d) that he initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. \nApplicant has not participated in credit counseling and has not established that his debts \nare being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence, particularly documentary evidence, to mitigate security \nconcerns shown by his delinquent debts. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose the five delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) when he submitted his December \n2020 application for a security clearance. (Item 3 at 42) Applicant denied any intent to \nfalsify when he answered the SOR. However, in explaining the circumstances of the debts \nin his background interview, he explained that several of the debts came after he \nattempted to start a business as a mechanic but was not able to do so, so he was not \nable to pay for the equipment. He took no action because the debts were presumably \nwritten off. I conclude that Applicant knew enough about the debts that he should have \nlisted them on his SCA. I find that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nHowever, I also conclude that Applicant volunteered information about his debts \nwhen he had his background interview, in February 2021, and he did so before he was \nconfronted about them. The following mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 17 therefore \napplies: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, even \nif they were incurred due to a failed attempt to start a business. He needs to establish \nthat he has addressed, or is addressing, his past-due debts in a responsible way, through \nevidence of a track record of steady payments and financial stability. Since Applicant did \nnot request a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about his debts, or to assess \nthe reasonableness of his actions to address them. He also provided no updated \ninformation about his debts after answering the SOR. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude that while personal conduct security concerns are mitigated, \nthe financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 63 years old. He is single, has never married and he has no children. \nHe has worked for a federal contractor since 2015 as an electronics technician. He was \ngranted a security clearance in 2016. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps (active and \nreserve) from 1978-1983. He also served in the U.S. Army reserve from 1990 to 1996. \nHe received honorable discharges for all this service. He holds two associate\u2019s degrees \nin computer science and networking. (Tr.2 at 5, 17-19, 59, 62; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged that in December 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed \npsychologist who opined that Applicant\u2019s history of delusional beliefs, persecutory ideas, \nand limited insight may impair his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nIn March 2020, Applicant reported to his employer that while he was at a casino, \nhe believed his truck was broken into and his backpack containing his security \ncredentials was ransacked. Nothing was taken, but he was concerned that his \ncredentials had been compromised, which is why he reported it. No evidence of a \nbreak-in was discovered by the law enforcement agency investigating this incident. \nBecause Applicant had reported other break-ins to both his residence and his truck \npreviously, which were unsubstantiated, his employer sent him for a fitness for duty \nexamination In May 2020. (GE 5) \nApplicant\u2019s fitness for duty examination was conducted by Dr. K, a doctor of \nosteopath (DO). Ten days before the fitness for duty physical examination, a \npsychological evaluation was conducted that apparently did not detect evidence of a \npsychotic disorder. There is no information about who conducted this examination. \nApplicant described for Dr. K an incident that occurred in 2016 where he had an IRS-\nissued refund check stolen from him that was later cashed.

(GE 5) \nApplicant also sent a letter to his employer after the alleged March 2020 truck \nbreak-in wherein he specifically alleged that employees of a local security company \nwere the ones that broke into his truck.

(Tr.2 at 73-75; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that his truck was broken into every day for two years, or \napproximately 700 times. He knew this because he noticed small differences when he \ngot into his truck like the mirrors\u2019 different positions, the visor\u2019s position, and the position \nof his handicap placard.

(Tr.2 at 80, 83, 123-124, \n158-159) \nIn the processing of this security clearance adjudication, the DOD requested that \nApplicant participate in a psychological examination. In December 2021, Dr. S, a \nlicensed psychologist with a doctor of psychology degree (PsyD), and who is board \ncertified in behavior and cognitive psychology, conducted a semi-structured clinical \ninterview with Applicant, reviewed self-report questionnaires, reviewed medical records, \nand conducted clinical testing (including the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality \nInventory-28 (MMPI)).

He related his concern about his truck break-in, his apartment break-in, concerns \nabout his upstairs neighbors who he believed placed sensors in his carpet, controlled \nhis television set (although Applicant testified that he did not own a television), and that \nhis water faucets were turned on randomly at night to disrupt his sleep.

(Tr.2 at 100-105, 143; GE 7) \nBased upon Applicant\u2019s clinical interview, his test results, and his medical history, \nDr. S opined the following: \n1. Review of Applicant\u2019s MMPI results revealed a pattern of underreporting \nsuggesting he answered the questions in such a way to put a positive light by denying \ncommon faults or shortcomings; \n2. Based upon his MMPI results and other self-report measures, Applicant \nappears to exhibit a pattern of avoidance and denial of symptoms or limited insight into \nthe presence of symptoms; and \n3. Based upon Applicant\u2019s history of delusional beliefs, persecutory ideas, and \nlimited insight, his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are impaired. \nDr. S formally diagnosed Applicant, under the Diagnostic and Statical Manual-fifth \nedition (DSM-5) with Delusional Disorder, persecutory type (DSM-5 297.1). She \nrecommended that Applicant engage in a thorough personality assessment and/or \nneuropsychological evaluation to determine the specific mental health condition likely \ncontributing to his paranoid thinking and ongoing fixed belief structure. Since the \nevaluations by Dr. K, Dr. S, and Dr. T (see below), Applicant has not participated in any \ncounseling. (Tr.2 at 157; GE 7) \nOn December 12, 2022, Applicant\u2019s attorney referred him to Dr. T for their own \npsychological assessment. Dr. T has a Ph.D. in counseling and is a licensed marriage \nand family therapist (LMFT), and a certified employee assistance professional. Dr. T \nconducted a two-hour interview with Applicant and reviewed Dr. K\u2019s and Dr. S\u2019s reports. \nDr. T did not review any of Applicant\u2019s medical records, background investigation \nrecords, or conduct any psychological testing. Dr. T prepared a report reflecting her \nfindings and opinions. (Tr.2 at 23-24, 28, 40-48; GE 5, 7; AE A) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s interview with Dr. T, he reported several events to her that he \ndenied telling Dr. S about during her clinical interview.

Applicant does not appear to present with psychological symptoms that would \nimpair his judgment at this time or working within his scope of practice and knowledge; \n2. Applicant denied a history of delusional or psychotic process, and none is \ncurrently evident; \n3. Applicant demonstrated no \u201cfixed beliefs\u201d regarding whether the IRS had \nsurveilled him, rather, he posited that as the only possibility that came to him, which \ncould explain the events that transpired. \nDr. T opined that Applicant\u2019s mental state was healthy, although he appeared na\u00efve \nconcerning his beliefs about his view of the IRS surveilling him. She also did not believe \nApplicant fit the diagnosis for paranoia because he only expressed his paranoia \nregarding his concern about the IRS and not everything else in his life. (Tr.2 at 27-28, \n30-32, 34) \nCharacter Evidence. \nApplicant presented a letter from his supervisor for the last five years, who stated \nthat Applicant \u201chas never given him a reason to believe he is a threat to national \nsecurity.\u201d He does not state whether he was aware of the reasons why Applicant\u2019s \nclearance was being reviewed. (AE B) \nApplicant presented a letter from a coworker who has worked with him for four \nyears and opines that he is a \u201cmost trustworthy individual, worthy of the highest security \nclearances.\u201d He also views Applicant as a dependable and stable man. He does not \nstate whether he was aware of the reasons why Applicant\u2019s clearance was being \nreviewed. (AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of seeking \nmental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nIn December 2021, a mental health professional (Dr. S) diagnosed Applicant, \nunder the Diagnostic and Statical Manual-fifth edition (DSM-5) with Delusional Disorder, \npersecutory type (DSM-5 297.1). Based upon this diagnosis and Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelusional beliefs, persecutory ideas, and limited insight, Dr. S opined that Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are impaired. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nThe adjudicative guidelines also include examples of conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, as set forth in AG \u00b6 29: \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nIn May 2020, Dr. K, an osteopath, not a psychologist or psychiatrist, therefore not \na duly qualified mental health professional, performed a fitness for duty examination on \nApplicant. His services were provided for this testing through Applicant\u2019s employer and \nthere is no evidence that he was acceptable to or approved by the U.S. Government. I \nwill consider this in assessing the weight I give to Dr. K\u2019s report. He diagnosed Applicant \nwith PTSD, which he found to be stable with no effect on his work environment. He also \nthought Applicant suffered from mild paranoid/compulsive thought process without \npsychiatric illness. He concluded that Applicant was fit for duty. I gave this report and \nDr. K\u2019s opinion the least weight of the three opinions. \nApplicant presented the opinion of Dr. T, who performed a psychosocial \nassessment in December 2022. While Dr. T is a duly qualified mental-health \nprofessional (she is a licensed marriage and family therapist with a Ph.D. in counseling, \nwith years of counseling experience), there is no evidence that she is acceptable to and \napproved by the U.S. Government. I will take this qualifier into consideration as to the \nweight I give to Dr. T\u2019s testimony and report. Dr. T concluded that Applicant did not \nappear to present psychological symptoms that would impair his judgment. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nI am presented with three medical assessments that vary in their conclusions. I \nhave considered them all. I give the greatest weight to Dr. S\u2019s findings, diagnosis, and \nopinions based upon her qualifications, and because she conducted psychological \ntesting of Applicant, in addition to conducting a clinical interview. That testing revealed \nthat Applicant underreported common faults or shortcomings. This underreporting came \nto light during Applicant\u2019s testimony when he denied that he told Dr. S certain \ninformation that he later would tell Dr. T. This tendency to put himself in the best light \nwould affect what Applicant ultimately revealed in any clinical interview. Neither Dr. T \nnor Dr. K performed similar testing, thus calling into question the information Applicant \nprovided them during his clinical interview with each. AG \u00b6 29(c) has some application \nbut is not controlling in this case. AG \u00b6 29(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service, his contractor service, and the recommendations of his supervisor and \ncoworker. However, I also considered that he was diagnosed with a medical condition \nthat could impair his judgment. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate \nthe resulting psychological conditions security concerns. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline I. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The hearing was held as scheduled.  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nand 2; Applicant testified, but did not offer any documents. I admitted all proffered \nexhibits into evidence without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nNovember 28, 2022, and the record closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in his Answer to the SOR. (\u00b6\u00b61.a and \n1.b, and 2.a.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 57 years old. He was previously married from about 1984 to 2014, \nand he married his current spouse in 2020. He has three adult children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 1983, and attended college for one semester. He has been \nemployed by his present employer, a federal contractor, since November 2018. His job \ntitle is director of information technology. Applicant was granted an interim DOD security \nclearance in August 2019, and he has never been notified that his interim DOD security \nwas revoked. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1) \nDrug Involvement and Falsification \nIn his February 2019 SCA, Applicant intentionally failed to disclose, as required, \nthat he had used and purchased marijuana from 2012 to present. He testified at the \nhearing that he did not disclose this information because he was worried that he would \nnot get a DOD security clearance, and he would be fired by his employer. He also \nadmitted that during his first background interview conducted in June 2019, he \ndeliberately failed to disclose his use and purchase of marijuana to an authorized DOD \ninvestigator. A second interview was conducted in March 2020 to confront him about his \nfailure to report illegal drug use. He then admitted that he had used marijuana from \napproximately \u201c2014\u201d to the present time. He reported that he smokes marijuana at \nleast one time per week, and if he is on vacation, he will smoke it daily. He also \nestimated that he spends about $400 to $500 on a monthly basis to purchase \nmarijuana. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 15-18, 23) \nApplicant stated that even though he applied for a DOD security clearance with \nthe submission of the February 2019 SCA, he never had the intention to abstain from \nsmoking marijuana. Both he and his wife use marijuana in the home. He testified, \nhowever, that he recently made a decision to stop smoking marijuana. His last use of \nmarijuana occurred on October 2, 2022. He decided that he would no longer smoke \nmarijuana because he would like to keep his current employment. His wife continues to \nsmoke marijuana in the home. He also acknowledged that using marijuana is illegal in \nhis state of residence and in violation of federal law. He has not reported his illegal drug \nuse to his facility security officer.

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);\u201d \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, . . . .;\u201d and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to \nclassified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana \noccurred in October 2022 while he possessed an interim DOD security clearance. He \nfailed to abstain from using marijuana despite acknowledging the use and purchase of \nillegal drugs violates federal law and is illegal in his state of residence. He has not \nchanged his environment and cannot disassociate from his wife who continues to use \nmarijuana in their home. In February 2019, he submitted a SCA to begin the process of \nobtaining a DOD security clearance. He continued to use and purchase marijuana for \nthree years after he was granted an interim security clearance. Applicant\u2019s last use of \nmarijuana was three months ago. His recent decision to stop using marijuana, although \na step in the right direction, is too recent to show rehabilitation. Applicant failed to \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant deliberately falsified his February 2019 SCA by intentionally failing to \ndisclose his use and purchase of marijuana. His admissions and evidence in the record \nshows that AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not allege the deliberate omission of his illegal drug use \nand purchase during his June 2019 background interview. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which \nconduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered, stating:  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegation will not be considered \nexcept for the five purposes listed above. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant intentionally falsified his 2019 \nSCA, and although not alleged in the SOR, he deliberately failed to disclose his illegal \ndrug use during his June 2019 background interview. It was not until March 2020, \nduring his second background interview and only after being confronted with information \nabout his drug use, that he finally admitted his illegal drug involvement to the \ninvestigator. This conduct does not demonstrate a prompt, good-faith effort to correct \nhis previous omissions and falsifications. He has established a pattern of dishonesty, \nwhich casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and overall good judgment. The \npersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding an interim security clearance places a\nheavy burden on him to establish mitigation. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter considering the record as a whole, to include the circumstances \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana, I conclude that Applicant has \nnot met his heavy burden of proof and persuasion due to the recency of his last use of \nmarijuana, and his continued drug involvement for three years while he possessed an \ninterim DOD security clearance. His pattern of dishonesty continues to cast doubt on his \nreliability and trustworthiness. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Miller, Esq. Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/27/2023 \nDecision \nWESLEY, ROGER C. Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated criminal and personal conduct concerns, but did not mitigate \nfinancial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information or to hold \na sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn May 4, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Central Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                          \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant responded to the SOR on May 31, 2022, and requested a hearing. This \ncase was assigned to me on December 22, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for \n\u00b6February 13, 2023, via Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard on the \nscheduled date. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of seven exhibits. \n(GEs 1-7) Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and no exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on February 24, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nPrior to the case assignment to myself, the Government amended the SOR to \nadd criminal conduct allegations under Guideline J covering an arrest and charge of \nApplicant in February 2022 with Assault Class-C Family Violence and Interference with \nPublic Duties. The Government cross-alleged these allegations under Guideline E. \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of his child \nsupport payments (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and an updated credit report. (Tr. 100-101) For good \ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record. The \nGovernment was afforded two days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant \nsupplemented the record with: documented payments of his owed child support \npayments (SOR \u00b6 1.p); a payoff of one of his credit card debts (SOR \u00b6 1.j); payments \nmade on two finance debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f); a payoff of an SOR utility debt (SOR \n\u00b6 1.m); a debt negotiation agreement covering three of the listed SOR creditors (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, and 1.i); and an updated credit report. \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted without objection as AEs A \nA-J. These post-hearing submissions will be considered along with Applicant\u2019s admitted \nhearing exhibits. \n  Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated 15 delinquent \nconsumer debts exceeding $48,000, in addition to back child support exceeding $2,955. \nAllegedly, these debts have not been resolved. \nUnder Guideline J, Applicant allegedly was arrested in February 2022 and \ncharged with Assault Class C-Family Violence and Interference with Public duties. \nThese Guideline J allegations were cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted most of the alleged SOR debts \nwith explanations. He claimed he has since taken care of his back child support \nobligations and addressed his debts owed to other creditors listed in the SOR. And, he \nclaimed to be making \u201cbetter strides in taking care of my finances.\u201d (Response) \nApplicant denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.n, claiming he previously \npaid off these debts. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAddressing the allegations averred in the amended SOR, Applicant admitted the \nallegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a .He added no claims or explanations. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 45-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in April 2012 and divorced in December 2015. (GE 1; Tr.36) \nHe has two children from this marriage. (GE 1; Tr. 30) He remarried in February 2020 \nand has a four-year-old daughter and stepson (age 11) from his first marriage. (GE 1; \nTr. 37-38; 40-41) Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in October 2020. (GE 1) \nApplicant enlisted in the Marine Corps in September 1995 and served four years \nof active duty before receiving an honorable discharge in September 1999. (GE 1) In \nOctober 1999, he enlisted in the Army and served 15 years of active duty. (GE 1) His \nservice included multiple deployments to war zones. (Tr. 33) Applicant received an \nhonorable discharge in September 2015. (GE 1) \nSince November 2019, Applicant has been employed by a local school district as \na Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) instructor. (GEs 1-2 and AE A; Tr. 44-45) \nBetween September 2015 and October 2029 (save for two months of reported \nunemployment between January 2019 and March 2019), he worked for other non-\ndefense employers in various jobs. (GE 1) He has held a security clearance since June \n2014. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nFollowing his Army discharge in 2015, Applicant encountered financial difficulties. \n(GEs 1-5; Tr. 49) Problems that weakened his finances included his recurrent difficulties \nin finding work in the months following his Army discharge. With increased family \nburdens, very limited resources, and a strained marriage that ultimately ended in \ndivorce, he was able to afford only basic necessities (like his mortgage, food, and \nutilities. etc.). (Applicant\u2019s response; Tr. 32) \nBetween 2015 and 2021, Applicant accumulated 15 delinquent consumer debts \nexceeding $48,000. (GEs 1-5) During this five-year period, he also accrued back child \nsupport obligations to his first wife in the amount of $2,955. (GE 2 and Applicant\u2019s \nresponse) While he has since addressed some of the listed SOR debt delinquencies \n(six in all to date, inclusive of his back child support obligations), for the most part he \nhas not paid or resolved the bulk of the covered SOR debts. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n Debts Applicant has addressed to date are comprised of the following: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a (a $10,459 finance debt through a payment agreement in which Applicant has made \nthree payments of $342 a month in compliance with the agreement\u2019s terms); 1.b \n(through a settlement agreement with the creditor that calls for monthly payments of \n$293, beginning in February 2023); 1.f (payoff of settled $993 credit card account); 1.j \n(payoff of $993 debt for reduced $600 amount) (AE F; Tr. 51-55); 1.m (payment in full of \na $214 utility debt); and 1.n (payment in full of a $156 finance debt). (AE I) Applicant is \nalso credited with paying off his $2,955 back child support debt and bringing his child \nsupport obligations to his first wife into a current status.

(AE G) While settlement results have been \npositive in resolving his SOR 1.a and 1.f debts, his settlement efforts have not been \nfruitful to date for resolving his SOR 1.k debt and the other still outstanding delinquent \naccounts listed in the SOR.. \nStill, Applicant\u2019s payment efforts remain a work in progress, despite his apparent \nfinancial ability to make more inroads into resolving his remaining delinquent accounts. \nHe reported current net monthly income of $7,332. (AEs A-B; Tr. 39) With his wife\u2019s \nreported net monthly income of $4,000, he reported a combined net monthly income of \n$11,332. (AE B) His reported individual monthly expenses of $3,636, and his combined \nmonthly family expenses are $5,795. (AE B) \nBased on these furnished figures, Applicant retains an individual monthly \nremainder in excess of $3,650 and a combined monthly family remainder in excess of \n$5,500. (AE B) For additional resources should he need them in addressing his \ndelinquent accounts, he can always access his listed family available savings of \n$17,000 and 403(b) savings of $3,500. (AE B) Why he has not been able to make more \nprogress in paying and resolving his delinquent accounts with the monetary resources \navailable to him is neither clear nor reconcilable with his claims of limited resources to \naddress his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s domestic violence incident \nIn February 2022, Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault Class C-\nFamily Violence and Interference with Public Duties. (GEs 6-7) The police report \ncovering the underlying incident includes a police narrative of an officer responding to a \ncomplaint from a friend at a local bar who claimed Applicant assaulted his wife in a bar \nand had her in a headlock. (GE 7) \nDisputing the police narrative of Applicant\u2019s having his wife in a headlock during \na heated argument inside the bar, Applicant insisted the police narrative represented a \nmisunderstanding of what was actually taking place between Applicant and his wife on \nthe night of the incident.

(Tr. 92) He assured that it was \nnever his intention to instigate any disturbance in the facility or cause any harm to his \nwife. (Tr, 92-93) Missing from Applicant\u2019s account of the reported incident is why he \nfound it necessary to place his wife in a headlock. Was it something in their discussion \nthat Applicant found to be provocative or threatening from his wife that prompted him to \nrespond defensively to her? Or did he simply overreact to something his wife said or \ndid that provoked him? No clear answers are available without more clarifying \ninformation from Applicant and his spouse. \nBecause the limited police narrative of the friend\u2019s testimony, their own struggle \nwith Applicant to separate him from the bar staff\u2019s holds on him, and the absence of any \nprobative accounts from Applicant\u2019s wife, clarifying explanations of all of the \ncircumstances surrounding the cited friend\u2019s observations of Applicant\u2019s imposing \nphysical restraints on his wife cannot be reliably assessed. All the responding police \nhave in their report is the friend\u2019s reported observations of Applicant\u2019s having his wife in \na headlock and the bar staff\u2019s attempts to remove Applicant from the premises while \npolice were still in the bar investigating the incident. Attempts by responding police to \nmake contact with Applicant\u2019s wife on multiple occasions to take photographs of her and \nelicit more details from her about the bar incident were unsuccessful. (GE 7) \nWithout photographs and statements of Applicant\u2019s wife, or a court hearing or \nother public forum to sort out and validate the accounts of the respective parties to the \n2022 bar incident, reliable factual assessments cannot be made of the observed \nrestraints Applicant placed on his wife. In Applicant\u2019s favor, he has no prior arrest record \nto compare and evaluate any dispositions for violence on his part. But without any \nphotographs or personal accounts of the incident from his wife to weigh in juxtaposition \nto the witness statements in the police report, reliable interpretations of what fully \ntranspired between Applicant and his wife cannot be made. \nFurther police attempts to elicit photographs and details of the 2022 bar incident \nfrom Applicant\u2019s wife were unsuccessful.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \n\u00b6 15. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These debt \ndelinquencies warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. \nApplicant\u2019s 16 admitted debts with explanations and clarifications require no \nindependent proof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick \non Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited financial difficulties following his military discharge in 2015 \n(inclusive his problems in finding work, his increased family burdens, and his strained \nmarriage that ultimately ended in divorce), clearly his accrual of so many delinquent \ndebts over the past six years can be attributed to extenuating circumstances. \nRecognizing these added financial burdens on his keeping up with his debts, mitigating \ncondition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by \npredatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances,\u201d partially applies to applicant\u2019s situation. \nBy failing, however, to make more concerted efforts to address his debt \ndelinquencies over the past five years with the assortment of monetary resources \navailable to him precludes him at this time from availing himself of the mitigating \nbenefits of the second prong (\u201cacting responsibly\u201d) of MC \u00b6 20(b).

At this time, \nhe has not made enough progress in addressing his delinquent debts to enable him to \navail himself of the mitigating benefits of MC \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d   \nLacking financial counseling, MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe individual has received or is receiving \nfinancial counseling for the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a \nnon-profit credit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or id under control,\u201d is not applicable either to Applicant\u2019 situation. \nWith ample resources at his disposal to make more significant inroads into \nresolving his debt delinquencies, he has failed to take advantage of the opportunities \navailable to him. Without more payment documentation efforts on Applicant\u2019s part, he \ncannot at this time be fully credited with resolving his debt delinquencies and regaining \ncontrol of his finances. While his efforts in addressing some of his debts are promising, \nthey are enough to facilitate safe predictions about his ability to gain control and \nstabilize his finances.

And, because the dismissal was not accompanied by reasons for the \ndismissal, a full evidentiary finding of the actions Applicant was charged with cannot be \nreliably made. MC \u00b6 32(c), \u201cno reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense\u201d is partially applicable to the facts of Applicant\u2019 case. Why MC \u00b6 32(c) is not \nfully applicable to the facts and circumstances pertaining to Applicant\u2019s case is the \npresence of reasonable doubt as to whether Applicant\u2019s actions were misinterpreted or \nthe result of an unobserved provocation from his wife. \nTo be sure, it is possible that the convening court dismissed the charges for lack \nof a complaining and cooperating spouse to corroborate the charge against Applicant. \nBut even this possibility cannot be verified from the record evidence. Suffice to say, \nwithout more evidence to evaluate the domestic charges against Applicant, both \ninferences and conclusions are warranted that the charges cannot be fully validated \nindependent of a court dismissal. However, these charges do appear to be isolated and \nout of character for an applicant with no reported prior arrest history. Based on this \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s background, the incident in issue is an isolated one and is \nunlikely to recur. Partially available to Applicant is MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has \nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d None of the mitigating conditions covered \nby Guideline E have specific application to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and \nhis explanations of the debts attributed to him in the SOR, insufficient evidence has \nbeen presented to enable him to maintain sufficient control of his finances to meet \nminimum standards for holding a security clearance. \nAssigning considerable weight to Applicant\u2019s many years of military service and \nthe strong endorsements he received from his supervising ROTC chief, senior ROTC \ncolleague, community project founder, and his wife, all of whom credited Applicant with \nvalued service, trust, and building valued mentoring relationships, the 2022 domestic \nviolent incident charged to Applicant is considered to be an isolated incident in an \notherwise honored and respected military and post-military career. Considering all of the \ncircumstances, recurrence risks are low. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of 11 exhibits. \n(GEs 1-11) Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 14 exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on December 7, 2022. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit her the opportunity to supplement the record with documentation of the chips she \nearned from her seven years of sustained participation in an alcohol recovery program \noperated by Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in her home community. For good cause \nshown, Applicant was granted 10 calendar days to supplement the record. Department \nCounsel was afforded 10 days to respond. Within the time permitted, Applicant \nsupplemented the record with documented earned AA chips commemorating her seven \nsustained years of sobriety. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission was admitted without \nobjections as AE O. \nAdditionally, Applicant requested leave to furnish post-hearing submissions \ndocumenting her current income status and steps she has taken to repay her SOR-\nlisted delinquent debts. Within the time permitted, Applicant documented her \nemployment promotions, her repayment plan schedule, and her upfront $2,078 \npayment. Applicant\u2019s submissions were admitted without objection as AEs P-R. \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated six delinquent \ndebts exceeding $42,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding. \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant allegedly incurred five alcohol-related arrests and \nrelated charges between January 2001 and December 2015. Allegedly, one of these \narrests and charges included charges of driving on a suspended license. The \nallegations covered by Guideline G are cross-alleged under Guideline E. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged debts with \nexplanations and clarifications. She claimed she is a single mother and is currently \nreviewing her financial situation with her bankruptcy attorney. Addressing the \nallegations covered by Guideline G, Applicant admitted the allegations with explanations \nand clarifications. She claimed she has been sober for seven years and has benefitted \nfrom her continuing therapy and AA attendance. She further claimed that she has \nobtained her certification from her residence state as a recovery support specialist in \norder to facilitate her opportunities to assist other recovering alcoholics.6 \n2 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

Previously, she worked for other \nemployers in various jobs. (GEs 1-2) She reported a lay off and ensuing unemployment \nin 2015 and 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBurdened by her 2015 layoff and her struggles with alcohol and managing her \nfamily\u2019s needs as a single mother, Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent \naccounts: six delinquent debts altogether exceeding $42,000. (GEs 7-8 and AE E; Tr. \n27, 34-35) The listed delinquent SOR debts are comprised of the following consumer \naccounts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (for $13,087); 1.b (for $595); 1.c (for $6,674); 1.d (for $12,675); \n1.e (for $7,327); and1.f (for $1,375). After making a few payments on her SOR debts \nfollowing her 2015 layoff, Applicant ceased making any payments in 2016. (GEs 4-5 \nand 7-8) To her credit, she has kept her student loan accounts current and paid off \nsome of her student loans. (AE L; Tr. 27, 37-38) However, by the close of the hearing, \nher listed SOR debts remained unresolved and outstanding. (GEs 7-8, 35) \nAfforded an opportunity to provide updated documentation of her addressing her \ndelinquent SOR accounts, Applicant documented her employment promotion (AE P) \nand receipts of payments made to her retained debt repayment firm. (AEs Q-R) Under \nthe terms of her repayment plan, she obligated herself with making an initial upfront \npayment of $2,078 with monthly payments of $1,784 until her scheduled debts are \nsatisfied. (AE Q) Each of her payments is scheduled for allocation among her six SOR-\nlisted debts.

(GEs 4-5; \nTr. 25) She attributed her excessive drinking to her layoff, her abusive relationships, and \nparenting issues related to her son who was born out of wedlock in 2009. \nOngoing legal custody problems continued to plague and disrupt her \nrelationships with her son and the son\u2019s father.

(GEs 4-5; Tr. 43-44) Recognizing she had an alcohol \nproblem, she voluntarily attended AA meetings in 2007. (Tr. 43) A motivating factor for \nApplicant\u2019s maintaining her sobriety during this three-year stretch was her pregnancy \nwith her son in 2009.

AG \u00b6 15. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Her admitted debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although she qualified her admissions with \nexplanations, her admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing.  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s cited layoff and ensuing income limitations impaired her ability to \nmake her timely monthly payments on her debts. Application of mitigating condition MC \n\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency a death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances,\u201d applies to her financial situation. \nSince the hearing, Applicant initiated a repayment plan with a credible debt \nrepayment firm and has taken documented steps to address her SOR-listed debts with \nscheduled monthly repayments of her listed debts.

Applicant\u2019s \npost-hearing repayment efforts reflect good-faith steps undertaken to fulfill the debt \npayment requirements of her debt repayment plan. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). By the evidence \npresented with (inclusive of her post-hearing submissions), Applicant is able to \ndemonstrate a credible track record of actual debt reduction. \nAlcohol consumption concerns \nAdditional security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s multiple years of alcohol \nabuse associated with her multiple alcohol-related arrests and recurrent drinking to the \npoint of intoxication. While not all of the five DUI arrests resulted in convictions, they \nremain of overall security concern. \nOn the strength of the evidence documented in the record, three disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline apply. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d; 22(c), \n\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless \nof whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol abuse disorder\u201d; and 22(d), \n\u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed social worker) of alcohol use disorder.\u201d \nEach of these disqualifying conditions warrant consideration in an overall assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s years of alcohol abuse. \nCross-alleged under Guideline E are Applicant\u2019s DUI arrests covered by \nGuideline G. Applicable under the personal conduct guideline is: DC \u00b6 16(c), \u201ccredible \nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an \nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as \na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified information.\u201d \nRecognizing her mistakes in judgment associated with her recurrent periods of \nabusive drinking, Applicant achieved complete sobriety over the past eight years with \nthe help of AA participation and strengthening her work and family relationships. Based \non the evidence presented, Applicant may take advantage of several mitigating \nconditions MCs. MCs \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment\u201d; 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations\u201d; and 23(d), the individual has \nsuccessfully completed a treatment program along with any required aftercare, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations.\u201d \nApplicable mitigating conditions under cross-alleged Guideline E are 17(d), \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and \nsuch behavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d and 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to \nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d Each of these \nmitigating conditions cover Applicant\u2019s situation. \nBased on the composite of demonstrated corrective actions taken by Applicant \nsince she ceased drinking in 2014, Applicant is credited with making considerable \nprogress in the management of her mental health and associated drinking. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether her finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions, her \ndemonstrated progress in addressing her delinquent accounts, and her sustained efforts \nin practicing sobriety and training in helping other recovering alcoholics, and with over \neight years of individual counseling sessions with her family therapist, sufficient \nevidence has been presented to enable her to maintain sufficient control of her finances \nand alcohol consumption to meet minimum standards for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude financial consideration,  \nalcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns are mitigated.

During \nthat interview, he admitted that he sought treatment for anxiety and depression and was \nhospitalized at a military facility in November 2018. He sought this treatment after he had \nmoved out from living with his girlfriend in October 2018. He remained hospitalized for \napproximately 36 hours. Applicant admitted this hospitalization during his hearing \ntestimony. There are no medical records that document this hospitalization. There is also \nno evidence supporting Applicant\u2019s suicidal ideations at this point in time. (Tr. 54-56 ; GE \n2 (p. 6), GE 4 (no reference to November 2018 hospitalization)) \nApplicant voluntarily sought outpatient counseling at an Air Force mental health \nclinic from approximately December 2018 to May 2019. The treatment stopped when he \nwas discharged from the Air Force in May 2019. His medical care during this time is \ndocumented by the 120 pages of records contained in GE 4. Applicant\u2019s primary mental \nhealth provider during his sessions was Dr. C, a licensed clinical psychologist. Applicant \nhad one session with Dr. K, a psychiatrist. (GE 4 (pp. 14, 45-50, 112)) \nDr. C\u2019s initial diagnoses for Applicant in December 2018 were: (1) adjustment \ndisorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (DSM-5 F43.23), and (2) unspecified \ndisorder of adult personality and behavior (DSM-5 F69). During the course of the next \nseveral months, Dr. C continued to see Applicant in the clinical setting and documented \nthe following observations: \nApplicant\u2019s first session on December 7, 2018: He was hostile and \nuncooperative with treatment. He made little eye contact, which challenges \nhis credibility. A personality disorder is suspect of interfering with his \naccessibility to treatment. He is scheduled for psychological testing. \nApplicant\u2019s session on December 14, 2018: He was uncooperative with \ntreatment and would rather talk about himself, he related he felt victimized \nby a woman who raised a sexual assault allegation against him (see below \nunder criminal conduct discussion). He seems unwilling to engage in any \nauthentic therapeutic interventions; \nApplicant\u2019s session on December 17, 2018: He may be opening up but it is \nhard for him to let go of blaming his girlfriend; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s session on December 27, 2018: He is forming tenuous\ntherapeutic alliance after each session after he initially enters with a hostile,\nirritable attitude.

He seems to be disinterested in real change that can come from \npsychotherapy. However, his symptoms have reduced dramatically since \nhe has presented himself as a victim regarding the sexual contact  \nallegations. He is unauthentic and he is not aware that he is presenting that \nway; \nApplicant\u2019s session on January 14, 2019: He wants to come off his \nmedications because he feels he is underweight. He is more focused on his \nappearance than on his current emotions. He is opening up to some degree \nin therapy and is gaining some minimal insight into how his own behavior \nhas affected his current situation. He is very focused on the women who \nhave wronged him.

He stated that if he \nlost his sexual assault case he would kill himself. He also called his mother \nand told her the same thing. He is contradictory in his reports of confirming \nat the same time denying his suicidality. (Note, on this same day, Dr. C was \ninformed by Applicant\u2019s First Sergeant that Applicant had a plan to kill \nhimself with a gun if he was not discharged from the Air Force in 15 days. \nApplicant had written a suicide note.); \nApplicant\u2019s session on March 15, 2019: He is completely disengaged from \ntreatment, is argumentative, and cannot be pleased.  \nApplicant\u2019s session on April 22, 2019: He attended therapy today despite \nhis complaint that his treatment is lacking.

(GE 4 (pp. 33-37)) \nDr. C\u2019s final diagnosis was that Applicant presented with adjustment disorder with \ndepressed mood and anxiety. She summarized his overall progress during his sessions \nas follows: \u201cPatient did not improve in treatment and was only checking in because he \nrefused treatment but he was on the HIL (high interest list) and was required to check in.\u201d \nHe did not have suicidal ideations at the beginning or the end of his sessions. She also \nstated his prognosis is poor and that Applicant was unreliable and dishonest during the \ncourse of treatment. (GE 4 (pp. 12-14) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR answer, he denied that he expressed any suicidal ideations \nwhile treated at the Air Force mental health clinic between December 2018 and April \n2019. He also explained that he believed the prescription medication he was taking was \ncausing \u201cnegative feedback.\u201d In his hearing testimony, Applicant admitted he had a \ndifficult relationship with Dr. C. He believes she took things out of context. He also \ndisagreed with the medications she prescribed for him. He denied telling Dr. C that he \nwould kill himself if he lost his sexual assault case. He denied telling Dr. C that he called \nhis mother and told her the same thing. He denied writing a suicide note that his First \nSergeant disclosed. I do not find Applicant\u2019s denials credible when viewed against the \nconflicting record evidence. (Tr. 77-78, 89-91; SOR answer) \nIn December 2021, Applicant consented to a psychological evaluation arranged by \nthe DOD. Dr. M, a board certified, licensed clinical psychologist, approved by the DOD, \nwas retained to conduct the evaluation on December 4 and December 21, 2021. Dr. M \nconducted clinical interviews of Applicant, reviewed the medical records contained in GE \n4, reviewed Applicant\u2019s Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical records, and \nconducted psychological testing, including The Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory 4th \nedition (MCMI-IV) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory 3rd edition \n(MMPI-3). (GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s MCMI-IV test produced a profile of a response style in need of social \napproval with a tendency to present himself in a favorable light. The testing results \nshowed significant elevations on scales related to histrionic, turbulent, and narcissistic \npersonality patterns. The test showed that he also expressed general anxiety. The test \nindicated evidence of a moderate degree of emotional lability in his personality, and \nalthough he is typically able to function adequately, periods of marked emotional, \ncognitive, and behavior dysfunction are likely. (GE 3) \nApplicant\u2019s MMPI-3 test showed that the test\u2019s validity scale raised concerns about \npossible underreporting by him. However, the test was deemed valid.

Without stating it \ndirectly, he implied that this had some impact on him at the time of the evaluation. He \ndenied suffering from bi-polar mood disorder, however, Dr. M did not specifically diagnose \nhim with that disorder. She stated that without further testing (a neuropsychological \nevaluation), the diagnostic picture was complicated. He has seen a therapist through the \nVA two times in the past year. He provided some medical records from the VA, but none \ncontained any diagnoses or prognosis. He does not have any future sessions scheduled. \n(Tr. 115-116; GE 3; AE D; SOR answer) \nCriminal Conduct (Guideline J) and Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse\n(Guideline H) \n \nIn October 2018, while Applicant was in the Air Force, he tested positive for \ntestosterone, a schedule III controlled substance, during a urinalysis test. Further \ninvestigation by the Air Force Office of Special Investigation (AFOSI) discovered three \nwitnesses who either saw Applicant inject himself with testosterone or other steroids, or \nto whom Applicant admitted that he used such substances. A residential search revealed \nthat Applicant possessed a box of unused 31-gauge syringes and a vial of bacteriostatic \nwater. Based upon the foregoing, in January 2019, Applicant was administered Article 15 \nUCMJ proceedings by his commander for a violation of UCMJ Article 112a, wrongful use \nof a controlled substance. After consulting with a lawyer, Applicant accepted the Article \n15 proceedings, rather than requesting trial by court-martial. After making a written \npresentation to his commander, his commander found him guilty of the offense and issued \npunishment of a one grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand. (GE 2, 7-8) \nIn January 2019, Applicant tested positive during another urinalysis for letrozole, \nanother controlled substance. Applicant was again offered Article 15 punishment, which \nhe accepted. His commander found him guilty of the offense and issued punishment of a \none grade reduction-in-rank and a reprimand.

(Tr. 69-70, 72; GE 2; SOR answer)  \nIn February 2019, Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend reported to the AFOSI that when \nshe and Applicant were living together in October 2018, he touched her in a sexual \nmanner on three occasions. She claimed she told him to stop on each occasion. Applicant \nwas later questioned by the AFOSI and he denied any nonconsensual touching. The \ninvestigation was forwarded to Applicant\u2019s command for potential criminal action. The \ncommand decided that there was insufficient evidence to act upon. During his hearing \ntestimony, he denied this allegation. Additionally, he claimed he was a victim of sexual \nassault by his former girlfriend. (Tr. 45-48; GE 10) \nApplicant was discharged from the Air Force in May 2019, at the end of his \nenlistment. His discharge was characterized as a general discharge, under honorable \nconditions. (GE 1-2) \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \nApplicant filled out an SCA in August 2019. In Section 21 of the SCA, he was asked \nif he had ever been hospitalized for a mental health condition. He answered \u201cno.\u201d \nApplicant admitted he was voluntarily hospitalized in November 2018, for a 36-hour period \nin a behavioral health facility. He claimed in his SOR answer that it was not related to \nmental health issues. Earlier during his background investigation, he admitted the \ntreatment was for anxiety and depression issues. He told the investigator he was not sure \nhe should list it. (Tr. 55-56, GE 1-2; SOR answer) \nIn Section 23 of the SCA, Applicant was asked if, within the last seven years, he \nhad used any illegal drugs or controlled substances. He was also asked if, within the \nsame time period, he used illegal drugs or controlled substances while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. He answered \u201cno\u201d to both questions. That answer was false because \nApplicant was used illegal steroids between July and October 2018 and December 2018 \nand January 2019. He held a security clearance at the time of these uses. In Section 15 \nof the SCA, Applicant listed information about his military history. In the subsection \ninquiring about discipline, Applicant disclosed his discipline under Article 15 for positive \ndrug tests. This is similar information that should have been disclosed in Section 23, as \ndescribed above. (GE1) \nIn Section 25 of the SCA, Applicant was asked if he ever had a security clearance \neligibility/access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked?

(AE A-B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\u00ad\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of seeking mental health counseling.   \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 28. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nApplicant was voluntarily hospitalized in approximately November 2018 for a 36-\nhour period. In December 2018 he began regular sessions with a qualified mental health \nprofessional (Dr. C) at a military mental health clinic. During these sessions, Applicant \nspoke of committing suicide on more than one occasion. There is no evidence that he \nhad any suicidal ideations while hospitalized in November 2018. He was diagnosed by \nDr. C with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood. She gave him a \npoor prognosis and opined that he was unreliable and dishonest during his treatment \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsessions. In December 2021, a second qualified mental health professional diagnosed \nApplicant with mood and adjustment disorders, gave him a poor prognosis, and indicated \nhis treatment history called into question his judgment, reliability, stability, and \ntrustworthiness. All three disqualifying conditions apply here. \nThe adjudicative guidelines also include examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns, as set forth in AG \u00b6 29: \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional;   \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant testified that he has had two therapy or counseling sessions in the past \nyear through the VA. The VA records do not contest the earlier diagnoses of Dr. C and \nDr. M. Applicant is no longer taking medication. Based upon the totality of the record \nevidence, none of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \nand  \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\"Honorable.\" \nThe record evidence supports the allegations describing Applicant\u2019s acceptance \nof Article 15 punishment from his commander for two separate violations of using illegal \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndrugs. The alleged victim of Applicant\u2019s sexual assault provided evidence supporting that \nallegation. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c are established under AG \u00b6 31(b). Since Applicant\u2019s discharge \nfrom the military was characterized as general, under honorable circumstances, I find that \nSOR \u00b6 2.d was not established under AG \u00b6 31(e) \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b because his illegal \nsteroid abuse was recent and he continues to deny that he knowingly used the illegal \nsubstances, thereby limiting any rehabilitation effort. He failed to present credible \nevidence indicating he would not use these substances in the future. Given that \nApplicant\u2019s commander evaluated the evidence concerning the alleged sexual assault \nand recommended no criminal proceedings, I conclude that AG \u00b6 32(c) applies to SOR \u00b6 \n2.c. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The potentially applicable condition in this case is: \n(a) any substance misuse.  \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal controlled substances is supported by two positive \nurinalysis tests, witness testimony, and the seizure of syringes. AG \u00b6 25(a) is established.  \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s denial that he wrongfully used steroids, given the evidence supporting \nhis knowing uses, and his use while holding a security clearance, cast doubt upon his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or 26(b) \napply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine national; and  \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe record evidence is sufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal \nconduct and drug involvement and substance misuse guidelines. Nevertheless, as a \nwhole, Applicant\u2019s actions put into issue his judgment, trustworthiness and overall \npersonal conduct, as expressed in the general security concern in AG \u00b6 15 and the \nspecific concern expressed in AG \u00b6 16(c). Applicant\u2019s use of illegal steroids while holding \na security clearance raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 15 and AG \u00b6 16(c) apply to SOR \u00b6 4.a (related to 2.a-2.b). \nApplicant was aware that he was hospitalized for mental health reasons in \nNovember 2018. I do not find credible his assertion that he was not sure if he needed to \nlist that information on his 2019 SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 4.b. I conclude that \nalthough Applicant failed to list his steroid use under Section 23, he did provide essentially \nthe same information about that activity in Section 15 of the SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.c-4.d. Applicant admitted providing erroneous information about never \nhaving his clearance suspended. In December 2018, he signed for a copy of the letter \nsuspending his clearance and therefore had actual notice of something significant that \noccurred less than one year before he completed his August 2019 SCA. I conclude his \nomissions were deliberate. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 4.e. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s use of illegal steroids after he was granted a security clearance causes \nsignificant concerns. He was well aware of his responsibilities to disclose his \nhospitalization and his clearance suspension in 2019 when he completed his SCA, but \nhe failed to do so. He did not make a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his previous \nfalsifications. Deliberately providing false information on an SCA is not a minor offense. \nIt strikes at the heart of the security clearance investigation process. These actions raise \nquestions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(c), \nand 17(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s mental health \nissues, his military service, and his letter of support. However, I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s diagnoses and prognosis concerning his mental health issues, his history of \nsteroid abuse, and his use after obtaining a security clearance. He also deliberately \nfalsified his 2019 SCA. He failed to provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines I, J, H and \nE. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except the \nlanguage, \u201cYou expressed \nsuicidal ideations while \nhospitalized,\u201d which I find in favor \nof Applicant) \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b, 4.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.c-4.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of six exhibits. (GEs 1-6) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and one exhibit AE A). The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on July 7, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with updated payment information. \nregarding the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. For good cause shown, Applicant \nwas granted 14 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded two \ndays to respond, Within the time permitted, Applicant furnished documentation covering \nhis payment efforts regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions \nwere admitted without objections as AEs B and E. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated five delinquent \ndebts exceeding $40,000. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved \nand outstanding. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) was arrested in June 2018 and \ncharged with public lewdness for masturbating on a public walking trail, thereby \ncommitting a sexual act in public, for which he pleaded guilty and received six months\u2019 \ndeferred adjudication and a fine of $429; (b) falsified material facts during a September \n25, 2021 personal subject interview (PSI) with a DoD investigator, when he told the \ninvestigator the public lewdness charges were limited public urination; (c) unlawfully \nchoked an individual with his hands, for which he received a record of non-judicial \npunishment (NJP) (inclusive of reduction of grade and 45 days of extra duty) (d) \ncommitted an Air Force disciplinary infraction in March 2004, when he failed to pay the \ndebts he owed the Air Force and received a letter of reprimand in April 2004; and (f) \ncommitted an Air Force disciplinary infraction in November 2001 when he made a false \nofficial statement with the intent to deceive, for which he received a record of non-\njudicial punishment (inclusive of reduction in grade). \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations pertaining to \nhis finances with explanations and clarifications. He claimed he had made monthly \npayments to four of the SOR creditors and could not find one of the listed creditors \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) in his credit reports.

(GE 1) He \nremarried in July 2008 and divorced in December 2018. (GE 1) He has three children \nfrom this marriage. (GE 1) He married for the third time in August 2019 and has two \nstepchildren from this marriage. (GE 1) Applicant attended college classes at various \ninstitutions between January 1999 and August 2001 without earning a degree or \ndiploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the Air Force in March 1992 and served 12-plus years of \nactive duty before receiving a general discharge under honorable conditions in October \n2004. (GE 1 \nSince August 2017, Applicant has worked for his current contractor as a quality \nassurance inspector. (GEs 1-2) Between 2010 and 2017, he worked for other \nemployers. As a civilian, he has held a security clearance since June 2006. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nCiting financial difficulties associated with his divorce from his second wife in \n2018, and improvident spending by his first wife, Applicant accumulated a number of \ndelinquent accounts (six in all) between 2013 and 2019, exceeding $40,000 in the \naggregate. The SOR-listed debts are comprised of the following: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a (an \nindividual account opened in 2013 to finance a vehicle with a reported post-\nrepossession balance of $12,699); 1.b (an individual account opened in 2013 to finance \na $15,000 vehicle with a reported post-repossession balance of $9,140); 1.c (an \nindividual account opened in 2017 with a reported current balance of $3,316); 1.d (an \nindividual account opened in 2017 with a reported current balance of $10,225; and 1.e \n(an individual account opened in 2018 to finance a vehicle purchase with a reported \npost-repossession balance of $8,554). \nWhile Applicant has made sporadic payment progress with several of his SOR \ncreditors, he has failed to follow through with documented good faith payments and \npayment plans with his creditors since his debts became delinquent. (GEs 4-5; Tr. 60-\n65) Promised receipts of payments to these creditors never materialized. Claiming to \nhave a payment agreement with SOR creditor 1.d, the documentation supplied by \napplicant does not match any of the creditor information covered in his credit reports. \nCompare the information covered in AE A with the compiled credit bureau data in GEs \n4-5.         \nBased on the documentation furnished by Applicant, none of the delinquent \ndebts covered by the SOR can be credited to Applicant as either favorably resolved or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n     \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                              \n \n               \n \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin the process of being favorably resolved.

While in the Air Force, Applicant committed multiple \ndisciplinary infractions, for which he received NJP. They are documented  as follows: a \nfalse official statement with intent to deceive in November 2021, for which he received a \nreduction in grade; engagement in a sexual relationship with a subordinate between \nJuly and August 2002, for which he received a reduction in grade and forfeitures of \n$500 pay per month for two months and 45 days of extra duty; unlawful choking an \nindividual with his hands, for which he received a reduction in grade and 45 days of \nextra duty; and failure to pay debts owed the Air Force for misuse of a Government \ncredit card in March 2004, for which he received a letter of reprimand.GE 6) \nRecords document that in April 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with \npublic lewdness for masturbating on a public walking trail (a sexual act in public). \nAppearing in court to answer the charges, he pleaded guilty and received six-months of \ndeferred adjudication and a fine o $429. (GEs 3-4) \nIn a September 2021 PSI with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant was asked to describe the incident involving his 2018 \npublic lewdness arrest and charge. (GE 2) Responding to the investigator\u2019s inquiry, \nApplicant characterized the charge as limited to public urination. (GE 2) In his own \naccount of the incident, he failed to disclose the charged conduct and ensuing guilty \nplea covering his masturbating in public. Applicant\u2019s withholding of material information \nabout the details of his arrest and conviction from the investigatory constituted knowing \nand willful withholding of material facts about his arrest, charges, and ensuing guilty \nplea.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. \nThese guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. When evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the \nrelevant guidelines are to be considered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) \nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of \nthe conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nextent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the \npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 15. \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned. See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited divorce as a contributing source of his debt delinquencies \naccrued during his marriage reflects some extenuating circumstances beyond his ability \nto manage and control; although all of hte listed SOR accounts were opened individually \nin his name. Considering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s added \nfinancial burdens mitigating condition (MC) \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s to \nsituation. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent accounts once the issues associated \nwith his 2018 divorce and judgment lapses had passed prevented him from taking \nadvantage of the full benefits of MC \u00b6 20(b). Because he has not demonstrated enough \nexercise of financial responsibility following his divorce, he is not in position to take full \nadvantage of the second prong of MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cacted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d Without more demonstrated effort in addressing his major debts, most \nof whom stem from deficiency balances following the repossessions of three of his \nautomobiles, Applicant remains short of meeting the minimum eligibility requirements for \nholding a security clearance. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

Applicant\u2019s presented history of arrests, disciplinary infractions, and candor \nlapses, for which he failed to timely correct, warrant the application of two DCs of \nGuideline E. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 16(b), \u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information, \nconcerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical or mental health professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to \na national security eligibility determination, or other official government representative\u201d; \nand DC 16(c), \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, \nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information, fully apply to the facts and \ncircumstances covering Applicant\u2019s situation. \nConsidered together, Applicant\u2019s history of multiple disciplinary infractions \nincurred during his 12-plus year Air Force career, his lewdness arrest with a deferred \nadjudication, and his candor lapses about the details of his public lewdness incident \nwhen questioned by an OPM agent in a PSI conflate to create material questions about \nhis overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. None of the mitigating \nconditions potentially available to Applicant are applicable. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions, the \nextenuating circumstances associated with his divorce, the current state of his finances, \nand the judgment lapses associated with his with Air Force infractions, more recent \npublic lewdness arrest and guilty plea, and the misleading information furnished the \nOPM investigator in his 2021 PSI, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable \nhim to maintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding \na security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

He married in 1984 and has two adult children. He served \nin the Navy from 1978 to 1982, and in the Air Force Reserve from 1982 to 2010, and \nreceived honorable discharges. He has taken some college classes but has not earned \na degree. He has worked for government contractors since at least 2011. (Item 3) \nOn his 2021 SCA, Applicant reported financial problems due to gambling from \n2007 to 2012. He stated that his gambling resulted in maxing out his credit cards, \ndepleting his savings, and a mortgage delinquency. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges eight unpaid judgments totaling $89,261 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.l, 1.m); delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and \n2015, totaling $60,773 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.g, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p); two unpaid federal tax liens from \n2011, totaling $31,362 (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.h, 1.j); failure to file a federal income tax return for tax \nyear 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a state tax debt for $2,476 (SOR \u00b6 1.q); a debt in collection for \n$938 (SOR \u00b6 1.r); and that Applicant\u2019s unpaid and delinquent debts were caused in part \nfrom excessive gambling (SOR \u00b6 1.s). (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j, 1.l-1.p, 1.r, and 1.s. \nHe denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.q. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nWith respect to SOR \u00b6 1.k, Applicant claimed that he filed his federal income tax \nreturn for tax year 2012,and the Government did not provide sufficient documentation to \nestablish this allegation. For SOR \u00b6 1.q he claimed that he had a payment plan to resolve \nhis state tax debt. He provided a letter from the state tax commission stating that he does \nnot have any outstanding liabilities for his account. These two tax issues are resolved. He \ndid not provide documentation for any of the other SOR allegations. (Answer; AE A) \nIn his Answer, Applicant stated that his financial troubles started in 2008 when his \ndaughter became pregnant in college. She moved home and he supported her and his \ngrandson for four years. He did not state how much support she required, why she was \nunable to contribute to their household during those years, or in what specific way this \nimpacted his finances. He reported that he lost his job in 2010 and used credit cards and \ncasino earnings to generate income. On his 2017 SCA, he reported gambling as a reason \nfor his delinquent debts. This SCA also shows that he left his employment with the Air \nForce in May 2010 because he hit his high-year tenure.

He claims that he is working \nwith a tax service to set up a payment plan with the IRS. (Answer; Items 3, 10) \nIn his Response to the FORM, Applicant admitted that he has made poor \ndecisions, but says that they do not define his character. He asserted that he did not have \nany bills listed as delinquent on a recent credit report that he obtained, but he did not \nsubmit a copy of that report. The most recent credit report in the record shows that he is \nstill actively using his credit cards. The report shows that he has 16 revolving accounts, \nwhich have over a $21,000 balance combined. He stated that in the past, he has gambled \nto increase his income. He has not had any counseling for gambling, but claims he has \nstopped through prayer and church attendance. He did not provide any other evidence \nthat supports this claim. He reports that he has recently paid off his first and second \nmortgages. He asserts that he plans to pay off all of his debt. (AE A; Item 4) \nApplicant submitted a character letter that states that he is a respectable \nemployee, is a valuable asset, and is not a threat to national security. (Answer) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe Appeal Board held in ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016): \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required; \nand \n(h) borrowing money or engaging in significant financial transactions to fund \ngambling or pay gambling debts. \nThe SOR allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record \nevidence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), 19(f) and 19(h) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s unpaid and delinquent debts are recent, \nongoing, and unresolved. He did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that the debts \noccurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. These financial issues cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat his unpaid and delinquent debts occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. He did not provide sufficient evidence showing that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. While he has recently been able to pay off his first and second \nmortgages on his home, he has not made any documented payments on his federal tax \ndebts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant has not submitted sufficient documentation \nshowing that he has received financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source \nfor his unpaid or delinquent debts, his tax issues, or his gambling problem. There are not \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. He reported that \nhe had a serious gambling problem and that it was one of the main causes for his financial \nproblems. However, he did not provide sufficient evidence to find that he no longer \ngambles. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.q. It does not apply to any of the other tax-\nrelated SOR allegations. He has known about his tax debts for many years, and he has \nnot made any documented effort to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). I considered his employment history, military service, and character \nletter. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his unpaid taxes, delinquent judgments and \ndebts, and excessive gambling. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRoss D. Hyams \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant is a 39-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor since August 2022. She worked as a government employee at a naval shipyard from about February 2002 to July 2016. She received a security clearance in February 2002. She was self-employed as a graphic designer from July 2016 to December 2017. She worked for non-federal employers from December 2017 to June 2019. She was unemployed from June to November 2019, while caring for her mother. She was a federal employee from November 2019 to August 2022. She was hired by her current employer, a defense contractor, in August 2022. She has held an interim clearance since November 2020. (Tr. 27.)

Although the charge was reduced to \nreckless driving, she incurred about $8,000 in legal expenses. (Tr. 16.) Her self-\nemployment was not as profitable as she expected. Her student loans went into default, \nand she fell behind on credit-card payments and the loan for her motorcycle. (Tr. 18.). \nWage and income transcripts from the IRS reflect the drastic reduction in her income \nduring her period of self-employment. (AX C, D, and E.) \nThe SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from July 2021 \nand November 2020 (GX 2 and 3). The evidence related to the debts is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f: student loans totaling $46,135. In February 2020, Applicant \nentered into a rehabilitation agreement providing for $5 payments for 12 consecutive \nmonths. (AX H.)

She was scheduled to begin payments in January 2021, but \npayments were deferred in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity (CARES) Act. (AX H; Tr. 22.) \nThe CARES act provided for automatic forbearance and zero interest charges \nduring the forbearance. This student-loan debt relief was extended several times. Most \nrecently, it extended to permit the Department of Education to implement a debt-relief \nprogram, which is under litigation. Loan payments will restart 60 days after the debt-\nrelief program is implemented or the litigation is resolved.1  Appellant\u2019s student loans \nwere current when the forbearance went into effect. Her student loans are not \ndelinquent. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h: credit-card accounts charged off for $3,717 and $2,157. \nThe debt for $3,717 was charged off in August 2020 and the debt for $2,157 was \ncharged off in October 2020. (GX 3 at 4.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was \nmaking monthly payments of $300 on each of these accounts. (Tr. 36.) She did not \nsubmit documentation of payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: personal loan charged off for $2,035. This debt was charged off in \nAugust 2020. (GX 3 at 5.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that this debt was paid in \nfull. (Tr. 37.) She did not submit any documentation of payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: telecommunications account placed for collection of $1,105. In \nOctober 2020, Applicant made a payment agreement providing for six monthly \npayments of $122.87. (AX F.) At the hearing, she testified that it was paid in full. (Tr. \n38.) She did not submit any documentation of payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: credit-card account charged off for $808. This debt was charged \noff in October 2020 (GX 3 at 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she is willing to \npay this debt but has been unable to do so because she cannot find out who owns it. \nShe testified that she disputed the debt electronically and it was removed from her \ncredit record. (Tr. 40, 61.) However, the debt is still reflected in the July 2021 credit \nreport. (GX 2 at 4.) She did not submit any documentation of her dispute or its \nresolution. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: credit-card account placed for collection of $1,575. Applicant \ntestified that she paid this debt with the proceeds of the loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. (Tr. \n41.) The debt was charged off in March 2016 and is reflected as disputed in the July \n2021 and November 2020 credit reports. (GX 2 at 4; GX 3 at 6). Applicant did not \nsubmit any documentation of payment. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: personal loan charged off for $2,417. Applicant testified that she \nincurred this debt to buy a motorcycle, that her mother gave her the money to pay the \ndebt, and that it was paid off when she sold the motorcycle. (Tr. 43.)

She argued \nthat the motor vehicle records show that she sold the motorcycle, but her evidence does \nnot support her claim that the motorcycle was sold. (AX A at 3.) Furthermore, even if \nshe sold the motorcycle, she presented no evidence showing that the proceeds of the \nsale were used to pay off the personal loan. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: medical debt placed for collection of $718. This debt was placed \nfor collection in October 2020. (GX 3 at 6.) Applicant testified that she incurred this debt \nwhen she went to an urgent care facility while she was unemployed and without medical \ninsurance. She testified that this debt has been paid. (Tr. 45.) She did not submit any \ndocumentation of payment. However, the debt is not reflected on the July 2021 credit \nreport. Because the debt is too recent to have aged off her credit record under the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, its absence from the credit report suggests that it was resolved. \nApplicant testified that her current salary is about $9,000 per month, which is \nabout $3,000 more than her salary for her previous job. She has about $500 in savings \nand $2,600 in her retirement account. Her monthly rent is $1,800. She has a ten-year-\nold car that she bought in 2019, and her payments on the loan are $414. She has a \nmonthly remainder of $200 to $300 after paying all her expenses. She plans to travel \noverseas in the summer and has budgeted $6,000 for the trip. She testified that she has \na financial counselor, and she uses computer software to track her expenses. (Tr. 46-\n54.) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor has known her for 10 years. He submitted a letter stating \nthat she has been selected for multiple special assignments because of her character \nand willingness to help. He states that she has left a positive impact and improvement \non every assignment. In addition to her work, she has \u201cvolunteered for more causes and \nmentored more people than [he] can list.\u201d (AX B.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. The failure of Applicant\u2019s business, the illness \nof her mother, and her illness while she was unemployed and without medical insurance \nwere conditions largely beyond her control. However, she has not acted responsibly. \nShe has been employed continuously since November 2019. She has acted responsibly \nregarding her student loans, but she has not submitted documentary evidence of \nresponsible conduct toward the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant testified that she has a financial \ncounselor, but she provided no evidence showing that her counselor is \u201ca legitimate and \ncredible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service,\u201d and, except for her \nstudent loans, she has not submitted evidence that her financial problems are under \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f and the \nmedical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.n. It is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g-1.m. Although Applicant testified that these debts were resolved or were being \nresolved, she submitted no documentation of payments or payment agreements. \nApplicants who claim that debts have been or are being resolved are expected to \npresent documentary evidence supporting those claims. ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant testified that she disputed the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, but she provided no documentation of the basis for the dispute or \nits resolution. She has not disputed any of the other debts alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct resulted in a general court-martial conviction and a \nbad conduct discharge. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(e) are applicable \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,\ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nThere is a direct correlation between Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and whether he \nshould hold a security clearance. In addition to the assaults, he violated orders on \nnumerous occasions, and he lied in an attempt to cover up his crimes. He was \nuntruthful during his background interview and in his response to the SOR when he \ndescribed one of the offenses. It has been more than eight years since the criminal \nconduct. Nonetheless, I have unmitigated concerns. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified the SF 86 when he failed to report his \ndebts under the following specific question: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? \nIt is unclear why this was the only question alleged when there were other \nquestions that were more appropriate. In order to find a falsification under this specific \nquestion, the Government must prove by substantial evidence that Applicant had debts \nthat were turned over to a collection agency; that he knew that he had debts that were \nturned over to a collection agency; and that he intentionally failed to report that he had \ndebts that were turned over to a collection agency. The Government did not prove that \nApplicant was aware when he submitted the SF 86 that he had debts that were turned \nover to a collection agency. There is insufficient evidence to establish that Applicant \nintentionally falsified the specific question alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \napplicable to that question. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b cross-alleges the criminal conduct resulting in the general court-\nmartial conviction. Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not \nperfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under the criminal conduct guideline. However, the general concerns \nabout questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncontained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable to the false \nofficial statement made during the investigation into the charges. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for criminal conduct, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his unemployment after his court-\nmartial conviction. That came because of Applicant\u2019s misconduct. It was not largely \nbeyond his control. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant did anything about his finances until he \nreceived the SOR. The timing of ameliorative action is a factor that should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who begins to resolve \nsecurity concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his \nor her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant provided documentation of some payment agreements, but no actual \npayments. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect \napplicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at \n3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). He indicated that he intended to resolve his debts. Intentions \nto resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). The medical debts and the small insurance debt (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.j, \nand 1.k) have minimal security significance, and they are mitigated. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

The Answer included one \nattachment (Attachment). Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on September \n19, 2022. The case was assigned to me on September 26, 2022. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an Amended Notice of Hearing on October 14, \n2022. The case was heard on November 8, 2022. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of \nthe hearing on November 18, 2022. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 8, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Applicant Exhibit \nA, which was also admitted without objection. He asked that the record remain open \nuntil December 2, 2022, for the receipt of additional documentation. No further \ndocumentation was received from him, and the record closed on December 2, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 29 years old and recently married with one child. He has a high \nschool diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor as a mariner and seeks to \nretain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Government \nExhibit 2 at 2; Tr. 7-8, 26-28.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR \nspecifically alleged that Applicant has three debts that were charged off, or in collection, \nin the total amount of approximately $60,919. (SOR 1.a through 1.c.) He admitted SOR \nallegation 1.c with an explanation. He denied allegations 1.a and 1.b, stating that he had \npaid those debts in 2015. \nThe existence and amount of the debt in SOR allegation 1.c is supported by \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his Answer. All three debts are confirmed by credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government dated December 20, 2019; April 17, 2020; August 6, \n2021; and June 24, 2022. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7.) The existence of the \ndebts is also supported by his answers on Section 26 of his e-QIP (Government Exhibit \n1) and during an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement on June 29, 2020. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant stated that his financial difficulties were due to his being a mariner. He \nworks full time, but only periodically. He only earns money when he is at sea, which can \nbe for up to three to four months at a time.

(Government Exhibit 2 at 3; Tr. 60\u00ad\n62.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant denied owing Credit Union A $13,519 for account One. That debt \nwas charged off. \n1.b. Applicant denied owing Credit Union A $25,207 for account Two. That debt \nwas charged off. \nThe above debts will be discussed together for convenience. Applicant admitted \nthe existence of both of these debts but maintained that he had paid them in 2015. In \nsupport of that statement he provided loan documents from Credit Union B as the \nAttachment to his Answer. The Attachment shows that his aunt cosigned a $50,000 loan \nwith him from Credit Union B in May 2015. \nApplicant Exhibit A consists of two checks dated May 30, 2015, drawn on Credit \nUnion B and made payable to two different accounts with Credit Union A. Applicant \nstated that he had asked Credit Union A for a pay-off figure on the two subject accounts \nin the SOR. After he received the figures, he had Credit Union B make out the checks. \nThe checks were actually made payable to two other accounts Applicant had with Credit \nUnion A at the same time. A check for $18,815.85 was made out for Credit Union A, \naccount Three. A second check for $24,464.43 was made out for Credit Union A, \naccount Four. The credit reports show that accounts Three and Four have been paid. \nThe same reports show that accounts One and Two remain unpaid and charged off. \n(Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, and 7; Tr. 31-32, 57-59.) \nUpon reviewing the Government\u2019s exhibits before the hearing Applicant \ndiscovered the apparent mistake and went to discuss the situation with Credit Union A \nshortly before the hearing. According to him, a teller at Credit Union A showed him that \nthe debts alleged in the SOR were actually two additional unpaid debts that he owed at \nthe same time in 2015-16. This was confusing to him, and he informed the teller that he \nwas still unsure of which accounts were his and that Credit Union A appeared to have \nadditional money of his that was unaccounted for. The teller informed him that she \nwould look into the situation and get back to him. As stated, he was given additional \ntime to provide evidence as to his financial situation, including any information from \nCredit Union A, and no additional information was provided. Based on the available \nevidence, I find he has not paid or otherwise resolved either of these two debts. (Tr. 29\u00ad\n44, 49-50.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted owing $22,193 for an account that has been charged off. \nThe credit reports in the record show that this account was opened in 2016 and he \nstopped paying on the debt in 2017. This account was transferred or sold, and the new \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nowner sued Applicant in 2019. A default judgment was entered against him in August \n2021. He stated that the court and/or the creditor was trying to work with him on a \npayment arrangement during the COVID 19 pandemic. He was not able to provide any \nadditional information showing that this debt had been paid or otherwise resolved. \n(Answer; Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8; Tr. 44-49, 53-56, 59-60.) \nApplicant testified that his current financial situation is stable. He realizes his \nfinances can affect his security worthiness but has not yet taken the initiative to \ndetermine how he can reduce or pay off his past-due indebtedness. (Tr. 50-53, 60.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has three large debts that were charged-off in the total amount of \napproximately $60,919. He has not made any recent payments on these debts, and has \nno current plans to make payments on these debts. These facts establish prima facie \nsupport for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to \nmitigate those concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has not mitigated the security significance of his past-due \nindebtedness. These debts have been in existence for many years. I have considered \nhis statements that he paid off allegations 1.a and 1.b in 2015. However, he has not \nsupported that statement with evidence from Credit Union A, despite my giving him time \nto provide it. He has very little knowledge of the situation regarding the debt in allegation \n1.c. There is little to no evidence that he has behaved responsibly under the \ncircumstances, as required by AG \u00b6 20(b). He is fully aware of the impact delinquent \ndebt can have on his security clearance eligibility, but has not done sufficient work to \nresolve the issue. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable to his situation. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not presented \nsufficient evidence to show that he is resolving his debt situation in a responsible \nmanner. \nHe is not eligible for national security eligibility because continuation of \nfinancial irresponsibility is likely, and the potential for pressure or duress remains \nundiminished. Overall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(GE-1 at 9; Tr. at 65, 75.) \nWhile working on his doctorate he married in 2014. He and his wife have two preschool-\naged children. His children are native born U.S. citizens and do not hold dual citizenship. \n(Tr. at 60.) He became a naturalized citizen in 2019.

She is a dentist and is the process of buying her own dental practice \nwith her sister. (Tr. at 63.) She is not entitled to a pension from Iran. (Tr. at 65.) He was \nunaware if his wife was entitled to any property or accounts through inheritance. It was a \nquestion he had never asked. Her parents had sold their home when they moved to the \nUnited States in 2000. (Tr. at 65.) She last traveled to Iran in 2011 and her Iranian passport \nhas expired.

As of the hearing, his father had received his Green Card and his mother was \nstill waiting to receive her Green Card. They do not intend to return to Iran. (Tr. at 24.) He is \ntheir only child. She is 69 years old, and he is 79 years old. His father was a farmer, and his \nmother did not work outside the home. His parents sold the farm a number of years ago and \npurchased an apartment in 2008. The apartment is the only property his parents have in Iran. \nThey paid cash for their apartment.

None of his \nforeign family members in Iran are affiliated in any way with any foreign government. He \nexplained with an evident sense of pride the work he was doing in the United States and \nthe publication of his doctorate work in a recognized scientific journal. (Tr. 80-82.) \nNotice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Iran. Applicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in HE-I. The facts are summarized in the written requests and will not be \nrepeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that the U.S. Government has \ndesignated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. It conducts cyber espionage and attacks \nand more traditional espionage against U.S. interests and allies. It has a dismal human \nrights record. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. \nApplicant has family members and associates who are citizens of Iran. Two of \nthem are Iranian residents, but most of the family members alleged have acquired \ncitizenship in the United States or are beginning the process towards U.S. citizenship or \nin the case of his uncle a resident and citizen of an allied nation, but Iran continues to \nrecognize them as Iranian citizens. This is true even when the new citizens took no \naffirmative steps to maintain their Iranian citizenship, and in the case of the United States, \nswore to renounce allegiance to Iran. Nonetheless, they remain Iranian citizens, and if \nthey choose to return to Iran for any reason, they will be treated as Iranian citizens. Iran \nis hostile to the United States. It is a state sponsor of terrorism; it conducts cyber \nespionage and attacks, and more traditional espionage against U.S. interests and allies; \nand it has a dismal human rights record. Applicant\u2019s contacts with Iranian citizens create \na potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the \nevidence. When foreign family ties are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to \na foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. \n01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s academic work with two Iranian universities and writings with Iranian \nco-authors occurred more than ten years ago. He has had no further association with the \nuniversities or his co-authors. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j do not raise any disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially relevant: \n(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S; \n(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nFamily ties in a foreign country raise a prima facie security concern that required \nthe applicant to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation sufficient to meet \nthe burden of persuasion that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for him. Thus, Applicant bears the burden to establish that \nhis relatives are not vulnerable to influence, coercion, exploitation, or duress. In this case, \nApplicant carefully explained that most of his family is in the U.S. His mother and father \nare in the process of becoming naturalized U.S. citizens. He is their only child and thus \nhis children are his parents\u2019 only grandchildren. His mother-in-law and father-in-law are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen and an established medical \nprofessional. His children are native-born Americans. The only persons who remain in \nIran are an aunt and uncle with whom he has limited contact. Applicant does not discuss \nanything with his family members about his work or his job and he has no plans to ever \ndo so. None of his foreign family members in Iran are affiliated with a foreign government. \nHis work and writings with Iranian institutions and co-authors occurred during his \nacademic studies in Iran more than ten years ago. He has not had contact since with \neither the institutions or co-authors in over ten years. \nI find that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of the United States and the interests of the Iranian government, a \nterrorist organization, or his Iranian family members. I further find there is no conflict of \ninterest, Applicant shown that his relationships and loyalties are in the United States, and \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Iran, a country that is clearly\nhostile to the United States, and the heavy burden an applicant carries when he or she \nhas family members in a hostile country. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. Iran is a leading \nstate sponsor of terrorism, conducts espionage against the United States, and has a \ndismal human rights record.  \n \nAlmost all of Applicant\u2019s family members are in the United States or Norway an \nallied country. Applicant is not close to the two family members remaining in Iran. \nApplicant was sincere, open, and candid at the hearing. His testimony reflected a mature, \nintelligent, hard-working engineer, who performs well at his job, and has the endorsement \nof his supervisor. It is also noted that while he was born in Iran, he is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen by choice. He is proud of his many accomplishments in the United States that he \nhas achieved on his own. With his wife (naturalized U.S. citizen) and children (U.S. \ncitizens by birth) as his closest family ties, along with both of his parents who have now \njoined their only child and begun the naturalization process, as well as his mother-in-law \nand father-in-law, who are naturalized U.S. citizens, Applicant has established that his \npermanent life is here in the United States. He has no intentions of ever returning to Iran. \nThere is nothing in Iran for him. I find that his relationships and loyalties are in the United \nStates, that Applicant would resolve any attempt to exert pressure, coercion, exploitation, \nor duress in favor of the United States \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: Paragraph 1, \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence):   \nFOR APPLICANT \n8 \n\n \n \n                        \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j:   \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. at 39-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 2-6) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and unemployment after \nhis termination. The COVID-19 pandemic hindered his efforts to find another job. He \nremained unemployed from about November 2019 to May 2021. (Tr. at 28-32, 34, 36-\n37; GE 1) \nApplicant did not discover he was the father of his younger child until she was \nabout 11 years old. When the court awarded child support, it awarded about $46,000 in \narrearages. Applicant paid about $26,000 toward the arrearages from his share of the \nequity in the family home, which was sold as part of the division of assets in his divorce. \nHis pay is being garnished for the child support and arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.e).

His finances appear to be otherwise stable. \nWith his child support ending in the near future, he can use those funds toward paying \nhis delinquent debts. He has not received formal financial counseling. (Tr. at 31, 40, 49-\n52, 57-58; GE 2-6) \n \nApplicant called two witnesses who attested to his excellent job performance. \nThe witnesses praised his work ethic, judgment, reliability, responsibility, leadership, \nand trustworthiness. (Tr. at 12-27) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and child \nsupport arrearages. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce and unemployment after \nhe was terminated for viewing pornography on his work computer. His divorce qualifies \nas an event that was beyond his control. His unemployment was due to his own \nmisconduct and was not beyond his control. \nI am giving Applicant the benefit of the doubt about the small utility debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d). His child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.e) are almost paid. Those allegations are \nmitigated. See ISCR Case No. 20-03457 (App. Bd. Jun. 15, 2023). \nApplicant has not paid any of the three remaining debts alleged in the SOR. He \ndoes not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will pay those debts. \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that his financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the above mitigating conditions are \napplicable. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanipulate, protect, or move information.

The following are potentially applicable: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nApplicant violated company policy when he viewed pornography on his work \nlaptop. AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(e) and 40(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good\u00adfaith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nThere are no bright-line rules to establish when conduct is recent. It has been \nalmost four years since Applicant used his company laptop to view pornography. He is \nremorseful for the conduct. He stated that it was his way of dealing with a stressful \ndivorce. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson, and the conduct \nwill not be repeated. However, he knew what he did was wrong, he chose to do it \nanyway, and it cost him his job. His current employer is unaware that he was terminated \nfrom his previous job for viewing pornography on his work computer. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 22-\n00172 at 5 (App. Bd.

None of the \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations and use of information technology security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

IRS records dated November 28, 2022, show that Applicant\u2019s 2015 \nFederal tax return was \u201csecured\u201d on November 22, 2022. (Applicant Answer Attachment \n2; Applicant Exhibit L; Tr. 25, 27-35.) \nApplicant filed his 2016 Federal tax return in February 2022. As prepared, he was \ndue a refund in the amount of $1,215. He testified that he did not sign this return either \nand anticipated that it would also be returned by the IRS. He signed the form and returned \nit to the IRS along with his 2014 and 2015 tax returns in October 2022. IRS records dated \nNovember 28, 2022, show that Applicant\u2019s 2016 Federal tax return was \u201csecured\u201d on \nNovember 22, 2022. (Applicant Answer Attachment 3; Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 25, 27-35.) \nApplicant has filed all of his Federal income tax returns in a timely fashion starting \nin tax year 2017. This is supported by IRS account transcripts for tax years 2017 through \n2021. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 25-26, 36.) \n1.b. Applicant has resolved his State A 2014 through 2016 tax liability through a\ngarnishment issued by State A in approximately 2018. Tax records from State A\u2019s taxing \nauthority dated February 14, 2022, indicate that Applicant has no balance owed to State \nA for tax years 2014 through 2020. In fact, he has a credit balance for the 2016 tax year. \nHe moved from State A in 2020. (Government Exhibit 2 at 15-16; Exhibit 3 at 2; Tr. 19-\n22, 25, 29, 35-36, 45.) \n \n \nMITIGATION \nApplicant submitted his employee evaluations for years 2016 through 2021. The \nevaluations show him to be an excellent employee who exceeds expectations. He is \nvalued by management and respected by the people he supervises.

The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and State A income tax returns, as required, \nfor tax years 2014 through 2016. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes one condition in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant had been delinquent in filing his tax returns due to being depressed over \nthe end of his second marriage when his wife took his young child out of the country. He \nalso had a good-faith, but mistaken, belief that if he did not owe taxes he did not have to \nfile a tax return. He filed the subject tax returns in February 2022, before issuance of the \nSOR. Unfortunately, he forgot to sign the returns and they had to be refiled in October \n2022. The returns are now with the IRS and, as filed, he does not owe any taxes. His \nState A tax issues were resolved by a garnishment instituted by the State A taxing \nauthority. He indicated a credible intent not to allow this situation to recur in the future. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe fully mitigated the concerns over his income tax return issues. Guideline F is found for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to show that he has resolved his tax issues, and that they will not recur in the \nfuture. The potential for pressure, exploitation, or duress has been resolved. Overall, the \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant has met his burden to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under the guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance.

He uses marijuana in the evenings during the \nweek and on weekends. He primarily uses it for medicinal purposes but acknowledged \nthere is a social element in using it. He said he was unfamiliar with any employment \nrequirements to report his marijuana use. (Item 3) \nApplicant denied that any physician prescribed marijuana for him. He indicated that \nmarijuana is legal in his home state. He obtains it at a local dispensary.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the concerns related to drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nDNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting \nMarijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nRecently, the Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications. It states in \npertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by an \nindividual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual's life to \ndetermine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if at \nall, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions.1 \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant has illegally used and possessed marijuana with varying frequency from \nMarch 2011 up to August 2021, as alleged. He used it from December 2011 to February \n2012 after being granted access to classified or sensitive information while working for a \ndefense contractor. He admitted in his 2022 Answer that he intends to continue using it. \nThe evidence established the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Three may potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n1  Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting \nAdjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a \nSensitive Position, dated December 21, 2021 (SecEA Clarifying Guidance), at page 2. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant did not present evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nconditions. His use of marijuana is ongoing. He has illegally used and possessed \nmarijuana from 2011 when he was in college, up to 2022, when he submitted his Answer \nto the SOR. He has used it with varying frequency. He asserted that he has used it as a \nmedicinal aid to alleviate the pain he has suffered for many years from several medical \nconditions. He has not participated in a substance abuse treatment program, and there \nis no evidence to suggest that he intends to do that or stop using marijuana. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment. \nBetween December 2011 and February 2012, Applicant possessed and used \nmarijuana while working for defense contractor A and having been granted access to \nclassified or sensitive information. In February 2017, Applicant was terminated from a \nposition with defense contractor B because he admitted that he used and possessed \nmarijuana in violation of the employer\u2019s work policies. He then stopped using marijuana \nin order to pursue a position with defense contractor C, and he knew he would likely be \nrequired to pass a drug screening test. Soon after passing a drug screening test and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nstarting his current position, he resumed using and possessing marijuana on a regular \nbasis. The evidence establishes the above disqualifying condition and demonstrates \nquestionable judgement as articulated in AG \u00b6 15. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides a condition that could potentially mitigate security concerns \nraised under this guideline: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant used and possessed marijuana while working as an intern for defense \ncontractor A between 2011 and 2012, during which time he had been granted access to \nclassified or sensitive information. He continued to use it until he was terminated by \ndefense contractor B in February 2017 after acknowledging he used it. Applicant then \nstopped using it until spring of 2018. During that interim, he passed a drug screening test \nand obtained his current position with defense contractor C. He subsequently resumed \nusing marijuana on a regular basis. Applicant\u2019s intentional acts to bypass federal \nregulations was a serious breach of trust and casts serious doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability \nand good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in this whole-person analysis. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n                         \n \n \n \n      \n         \n \n \n     \n                   \n \n \n     \n                                   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of using marijuana beginning in 2011 when he was in \ncollege and continuing into the present. He stopped using it in 2017 when he lost a \ndefense position. For a couple months between 2017 and 2018, he stopped using it to \navoid a positive drug screening because he had applied for another federal position. After \nhe obtained a position, he resumed using it and continues to use it on a daily basis. He \nis candid about his usage, and he asserts that marijuana brings him pain relief for his \nmedical issues. While his usage may have some medical benefit for him, it does not \nprovide a waiver of federal law regarding the use and possession of marijuana for federal \ncontractors. The law is clear. It is prohibited and he is precluded from working for a \ndefense contractor and holding a security clearance, regardless of whether marijuana is \nlegal in his state. He is a mature person and is subject to the consequences of his \ndecisions. Applicant failed to demonstrate rehabilitation, significant behavioral changes, \nor mitigate the security concerns raised. Overall, the evidence raises serious doubt as to \nApplicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \n  Subparagraph 2.a: \n Conclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

He \ngraduated from high school in 2011. He attended college full time from 2011 to 2016. He \nattended college part-time from January 2017 to June 2017 and from August 2018 to \nNovember 2019. He did not earned a degree. He intends to continue to pursue a degree. \nHe has worked for a federal contractor since October 2020. (Item 3) \nAfter leaving college in 2016, Applicant had a series of jobs, some part-time and \nsometimes he was self-employed as a rideshare driver. From July 2017 to June 2018, he \nworked full-time as a member of AmeriCorps and moved to another state (State A). He \nworked with inner city and at-risk youth. He was not classified as an employee under this \nprogram and was paid a stipend, which barely covered his expenses in a high cost-of-\nliving state. He did not have a car, and his commute was an hour to and from the school \nby bus. Although he found this experience very rewarding, his days were often 13 hours \nlong with his commute. After he completed his obligation, he returned to his home state \n(State B) and worked as a rideshare driver. (AE A) \nIn the past, Applicant\u2019s father filed his federal and state income tax returns for him. \nHe was aware that because he lived in State A and State B for parts of 2017 and 2018, \nhe would have to file state income tax returns for both states. He believed his father had \nfiled his tax returns, but later learned that his father had only filed extensions. He resumed \ncollege, continued working as a driver, and worked for a company that hosted afterschool \nprograms for elementary school children that centered around science, technology, \nengineering, and math. He was considered an independent contractor. In February 2019, \nhe started a new job with a restaurant and his father told him he would file an extension \nfor him for his 2018 tax returns. This is when he learned that his 2017 returns were not \nyet filed, and he needed to complete them. Applicant admitted he was overwhelmed with \nschool and work. At the same time, his girlfriend, with whom he was living, was diagnosed \nwith Type 1 diabetes. He admitted he procrastinated in filing his tax returns.

He was expecting them to be complex because of his multiple moves and non-\ntraditional income from AmeriCorps, as a rideshare driver, and as an independent \ncontractor. Because of his limited income, he did not expect to owe taxes. His parents \noften filed their tax returns late, and he believed it was permitted to file late if you did not \nowe taxes. He now understands that is not correct. (AE A) \nApplicant suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which he is able to \ncontrol. It rarely affects his regular day-to-day activities, but he often feels compelled to \nmake sure everything he does is perfect. It sometimes causes him to delay acting on \ncertain things until he can ensure every detail is correct. He admits that he was reluctant \nto immediately address his tax issues because once he started them they would consume \nhim. (AE A) \nIn 2020, Applicant and his girlfriend moved to State C. Because he had only lived \nin one state the previous year, his tax returns were not complicated and he filed his 2019 \nfederal and state tax returns. It was the first year he filed his tax returns by himself. He \nadmitted he did not budget enough time to complete them and his federal tax return was \nfiled on July 22, 2020. Due to the pandemic, the deadline for filing 2019 tax returns was \nextended to July 15, 2020. He was seven days late. His adjusted gross income was \n$24,475. He was entitled to a refund. (AE A, D). \nIn January 2021, Applicant\u2019s apartment was burglarized. His backpack was stolen. \nIn it was his mileage log he kept when he was a rideshare driver in 2018. He was not sure \nhow to proceed to complete his delinquent tax returns because he did not have this \nneeded information. \nIn April 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) and in it \ndisclosed his failure to timely file his federal and state tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He \nexplained in the SCA that he believed for 2017 that he would not owe taxes and they \nwould be complicated to complete. He filed his 2017 federal and state income tax returns \nin April 2021. (AE B) \nApplicant also disclosed in his SCA that he failed to file his 2018 federal and state \nincome tax returns. He explained that he did not think he owed taxes. During this tax year \nhe was a driver and when his mileage log was stolen, it complicated how to estimate his \nexpenses. He readily admitted that he should not have delayed filing his tax returns. His \n2018 federal and state tax returns were filed in October 2021. His adjusted gross income \nwas $5,741. With penalties and interest, he owed $301, which he paid.

He filed his 2017 State B income tax returns in May 2021 and his \n2018 returns in October 2021. Applicant filed his 2019 State B returns on July 22, 2020. \nHe stated in his FORM response that State B allows for an automatic six-month extension \nfor filing if no taxes are owed. State B\u2019s filing deadline was June 1, 2020. Because \nApplicant did not owe state taxes, he was within the six-month extension period. (AE A; \nAE G page 1, 6, 9-11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleged Applicant failed to timely file State C income tax return for tax \nyear 2018. Applicant erroneously disclosed on his SCA that he lived in State C in 2018. \nHe actually lived there in 2020, so he was not required to file in State C for 2018. Applicant \nfiled his 2020 State C income tax returns 14 days late. He owed $48 and paid the tax. \n(AE I) \nApplicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2020 in May 2021. He was \nentitled to a refund. He filed his 2021 tax year federal income tax return on time in April \n2022. His state tax returns for these years were filed timely. \nApplicant takes responsibility for failing to timely file his federal and state income \ntax returns. He primarily attributed his failures to being inexperienced; overwhelmed that \nfiling tax returns would be complicated because he lived in multiple states; believing for a \nperiod that his father had filed for him; his belief that if you did not owe taxes you did not \nhave to file on time; and his procrastination. Applicant recognizes that he failed to make \nfiling his tax returns a priority, but that has changed. (AE A) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he said all of his delinquent tax returns are \nfiled and provided supporting documents. He paid whatever taxes were owed and any \npenalties and interest imposed. He now uses a software program to help him prepare his \ntax returns and plans to continue to use it in the future. He has created reminders on his \ncalendar to notify him when tax deadlines are approaching. He keeps a tax folder on his \ncomputer with copies of his previous tax returns. He has opted to receive all of his tax \ndocuments electronically and stores them by year on his computer. If he receives a tax \ndocument that is not delivered electronically, he scans it and saves it to the folder on his \ncomputer. He no longer works as an independent contractor so his tax returns are simpler. \n(AE A) \nI have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR \nfor disqualifying purposes.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as required.  \nApplicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, \nand 2019. He failed to timely file State A and State B income tax returns for tax years \n2017 and 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying condition. \nIt was alleged Applicant failed to timely file State C income tax returns for tax year \n2018, but he did not live in State C in 2018. It also was alleged that he failed to timely file \nhis State B tax return for tax year 2019. I find in his favor for this allegation. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax returns are filed and he paid any taxes he owed. \nApplicant repeatedly failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns. I believe \nfuture tax issues are unlikely to recur because Applicant has a new appreciation for the \nseriousness of ensuring he timely files and pays his taxes, he has a system in place that \nwill help him meet the appropriate deadlines, and he has matured and now understands \nthat filing tax returns on time is a serious responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. \nSome of the delay in filing can be attributed to Applicant\u2019s inexperience and \nintimidation of the potential complexity for filing the returns. Some of the delay can be \nattributed to him incorrectly believing that he did not have to timely file tax returns if he \ndid not owe taxes, which could be the case if he was under a certain income level, but \nnot if he was self-employed as a rideshare driver. I attributed these reasons to him being \nyoung and immature. These reasons were marginally beyond his control. However, his \ncontinued delay in addressing his delinquent tax filings was due to his failure to make it a \npriority, and to his procrastination, both of which were within his control. The question is \ndid he act responsibly under the circumstances. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s continued procrastination and failure to get his tax returns filed for \nan extended period of time. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has received financial counseling, but there is \nevidence that he has resolved his tax issues and that future problems are unlikely to recur. \nI find AG \u00b6 20(c) has some application. I also find AG \u00b6 20(g) applies as all of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent federal and state tax returns are filed. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Some of the factors in AG \n\u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI have considered whether Applicant was intentionally attempting to avoid filing his \ntax returns and whether he is likely to do so in the future. I note that he relied on his father \nin the past to take care of his tax returns, and he did not have an appreciation for the \nseriousness of making sure it is done timely. Clearly, his father did not set a good \nexample. When Applicant was in State A, receiving a stipend, and had minimum income \nhe did not understand his tax obligations. Moving to another state only exacerbated his \nparalysis in tackling his tax issues, so he again procrastinated, which made his situation \nworse. Applicant now understands his legal obligations and responsibility and will comply \nwith the rules and regulations that govern filing tax returns. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant successfully mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, Applicant did not \nmitigate alcohol consumption and criminal conduct concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 19, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Central Adjudications Services (CAS), successor to the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why under the alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct guidelines the DoD could not make the preliminary \naffirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

Department Counsel \nsupplied Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions shortly following the expiration of the \nsubmission time allowance, but the submissions were inadvertently not picked up and \nadded to our hearing file. \nFor good cause shown, I have reopened the record to admit without objection \nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions.

Further factual findings will be developed from the evidence presented in \nthe record. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old civilian employee of a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The admitted allegations are incorporated and adopted as relevant \nand material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant never married and has no children. (GE 1; Tr. 23, 52) He earned a high \nschool diploma in May 2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in February 2013. He reported no \nmilitary service (GE 1) \nSince June 2019, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as an \nassembler. (GE 1) Between December 2013 and June 2019, he worked for other non-\nDoD employers in various jobs. (GE 1) He reported brief periods of unemployment \nbetween October 2011 and December 2013. Applicant has never held a security \nclearance. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol background history \nApplicant\u2019s medical records reveal that he was introduced to alcohol at the age of \nseventeen. (GEs 1-6) Between August 2009 and August 2021, he consumed alcohol at \ntimes to excess and to the point of intoxication. (GEs 1-6) His drinking patterns during \nthis period consisted of daily drinking (generally three beers a day), and multiple beers \non the weekends (ranging between 18 and 30 beers). His drinking included assorted \nhard liquors as well. (GEs 2-3 and 6) \nBetween August 2009 and August 2012, Applicant was twice arrested for \nalcohol-related incidents. (GE 4; Tr. 24) Records document his arrest and charge in \nAugust 2014 for assault on a family/household member (his sister). (GE 5; Tr. 26-27) \nApplicant pled guilty to the assault incident and was fined $700 and told by the court \u201cto \nstay out of trouble.\u201d (GEs 2 and 6) The reported assault incident was non-alcohol \nrelated. \nFaced with episodic depression and anxiety, Applicant self-referred himself to L \nHealth System in August 2017 for counseling and treatment of a condition diagnosed as \nalcohol use disorder (moderate to severe). (GE 3; Tr. 33-34, and 40) During his 30-day \ninpatient stay, his treatment counselors addressed his diagnosed depression and \nalcohol issues with medications designed to mitigate his problems with these issues. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n(GE 3) His inpatient treatment protocol included AA attendance (with some meetings \nreported by Applicant during his 30-day inpatient stay). (Tr. 36) \nApplicant\u2019s L Health System discharge summary credited him with medical \nimprovement in all of the areas addressed and confirmed a fair to good prognosis with \nrecommended follow-up with his primary care health provider. (GE 3) For the ensuing \ntwo years following his discharge, Applicant retained his sobriety with the support of his \nfamily and stayed in compliance with the recommendations of his treatment providers. \n(GE 2; Tr. 36-37) \nFollowing his L Health System discharge in September 2019, Applicant resumed \nhis drinking during a family vacation. (GE 6; Tr. 36-37) Medical records document his\nreturn to drinking at daily levels in 2019. (GEs 2 and 6) In July 2021, he self-referred\nhimself for inpatient treatment at a local medical center\u2019s (O Center) chemical\ndependency unit. (GE 2) His admission diagnosis was listed as alcohol abuse severe on\nthe Axis 1 scale. See Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, American\nPsychiatric Association (5th  ed., 2013) (DSM -5). His 30-day inpatient treatment protocol\nincluded individual and group therapy sessions and AA meetings. (Tr. 41-42)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was discharged from O Center\u2019s outpatient facility in August 2021 with \na discharge diagnosis of alcohol dependency, depression by history, and nicotine \ndependency, all on the Axis I scale, and a listed prognosis of \u201cGuarded.\u201d (GE 2) \nDischarge instructions for Applicant consisted of the following: Attend 90 AA/NA \nmeetings in 90 days, with five meetings per week thereafter, attend aftercare sessions \nweekly for a minimum of one year, and obtain and utilize a sponsor. (GE 2; Tr. 55) \nOnce discharged from O Center, Applicant declined to pursue most of the \nrecommended AA and aftercare participation (attending only a few AA meetings before \nsuspending his AA participation). Citing his earned receipt of an AA chip \ncommemorating his one-year of sobriety and his own assurances of his sustaining his \nsobriety for the previous two years, Applicant assured that his sobriety program was \nworking for him. (GE 6) \nAsked in his personal subject interview (PSI) by the interviewing investigator from \nthe Office of Personnel Management about his post-O Center follow-up with\nrecommended AA participation, Applicant replied that AA did not work out for him. (GE\n6) He told the investigator that he has been able to control his urges to resume drinking\nwith the support of his family, aided by lessons learned from his past experiences, and\nis no longer a risk to return to drinking. (GE 6) When he needs additional support to\nmaintain his abstinence, he has his sister to turn to. (Tr. 54) \n \n \n \n \n \nTo his credit, Applicant contemporaneously self-reported his alcohol relapses to \nhis supervisors with whom he has good working relationships. (Tr. 38-39) For his \ncontinuing efforts in achieving sustained sobriety, Applicant is entitled to considerable \ncredit and encouragement. Applicant\u2019s sobriety assurances, while undoubtedly sincere \nhave not been corroborated by any updated medical diagnoses and prognoses and \nother reliable sources to validate his continued abstinence assurances.

Without \ncorroborating updates to validate his abstinence claims, favorable inferences of \nrecovery from a history of alcohol abuse cannot be made at this time. \nEndorsements \nApplicant is highly regarded by his supervisors (past and present) and family \nmembers who attest to his honesty, exemplary work ethic, and overall good character. \n(AEs A-F) His supervisors (both previous and current) credit Applicant with being a \nmotivated, punctual, trustworthy, and devoted to the goals of his team.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n Alcohol Consumption \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        Personal Conduct \n \n           \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the \nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 21. \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack f \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

AG \u00b6 30. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Additional \nsecurity concerns are raised over a single non-alcohol arrest and charge in 2014 for \nassault with a family member (his sister). \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn the strength of the evidence documented in the record, five disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the alcohol consumption guideline apply. DCs \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, fighting, child or \nspouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the \nfrequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed \nwith alcohol use disorder\u201d; 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point \nof impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nabuse disorder\u201d; 22(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder\u201d; 22(e), \u201cthe failure to follow treatment advice once \ndiagnosed\u201d; and 22(f), \u201calcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder,\u201d   are all applicable to the \nfacts of record in Applicant\u2019s case.  \nBy recognizing his mistakes in judgment associated with his recurrent periods of \nabusive drinking (even after receiving counseling and treatment for abusing alcohol), \nApplicant\u2019s abusive drinking is extenuated in considerable part by his encountered \ndifficulties in maintaining his sobriety for more than two years at a time, attributable to \nonsets of episodic depression and anxiety issues. Based on the evidence presented, \nApplicant may take partial advantage of two mitigating conditions (MCs). MCs \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \n\u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment\u201d; and 23(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation in this case. \nCross-alleged under Guideline E are Applicant\u2019s DwI and DuI incidents of 2009 \nand 2012, respectively. Both of these incidents occurred over 10 years ago and at a \ntime when Applicant was abusing alcohol on a daily basis. These alcohol-related \nincidents are fully covered by Guideline G and do not share any independent \nsignificance under Guideline E. Because of the addition of Applicant\u2019s non-alcohol-\nrelated arrest and charge of assault on his sister, Applicant\u2019s two DuI incidents and non-\nalcohol-related incident can be considered together as a pattern of minor expenses that \nretains independent significance in need of separate addressing under Guideline J. \nApplicable to this August 2014 arrest is DC \u00b6  31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any \none of which on its own would be unlikely to effect a national security eligibility decision, \nbut which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nBased on the composite of corrective actions he has taken since he last \nconsumed alcohol in 2021, Applicant can be credited with making considerable \nprogress in the management of his mental health and alcohol intake since his discharge \nfrom O Center in September 2021. However, validation of his maintaining his sobriety \nover the past two years cannot be accepted on the basis of his assurances alone. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBefore he can be fully cleared of relapse risks, both letters of support and an updated \ndiagnosis and prognosis are needed to clear away any doubts about his recurrence \nrisks. Offered an opportunity to provide medical updates and endorsements from \ntherapists, supervisors, coworkers, family, and friends who are familiar with his past \nalcohol issues and his progress in avoiding alcohol over the past two years, Applicant \nfurnished strong post-hearing endorsements of his character and trustworthiness. None \nof his references could attest to his past problems with alcohol abuse and what steps he \nis currently taking to maintain his sobriety and satisfy the post-discharge \nrecommendations of his O Center treating professionals. \nEpisodic periods of depression and anxiety that affected Applicant and influence \nhis recurrent turn to drinking are clearly extenuating and mitigating. However, the \ncircumstances that prompted him to return to abusive drinking to self-medicate his \nemotional issues are not enough to relieve him of his responsibilities of satisfying the \npost-discharge recommendations of his O Center treating professionals. Without an \nupdated diagnosis and prognosis from an aftercare therapy group, Applicant\u2019s \nabstinence assurances cannot be solely relied upon at this time that Applicant can (a) \nmaintain his established abstinence regimen and (b) is at no material risk to return to \nalcohol abuse in the foreseeable future. \nBy contrast, Applicant\u2019s two DwI and DuI offenses and non-alcohol-related \nassault offense involve considered minor offenses that taken together reflect mistakes \nof judgment that have not recurred since the last reported incident of August 2014. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s alcohol issues retain continuing security concerns, he has leaned \nenough from his past mistakes of judgment to present little risk of recurrent criminal \narrests. Applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation is MC \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed \nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of recurrent alcohol abuse is incompatible with his \nholding a security clearance. Since his discharge from counseling and treatment from O \nCenter in 2021, he has made considerable progress in managing his alcohol-related \nissues and shows good promise in sustaining his abstinence in the future. He deserves \nconsiderable credit as well for his contributions to the defense industry. Updates are \nneeded (both personal and professional) to verify and corroborate his progress Based \non the evidence presented, it is still too soon to absolve him of risks of recurrence \nbased on the developed record. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 52 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2007. He has been married since 1996. He has two children with his current wife, and they also adopted his niece and nephew. He has four children before he became married in 1996. His youngest daughter and nephew still reside in the home. Since 2007, he has been employed as an electronic mechanic with a DOD contractor. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance.

Since his Answer was unclear, Applicant clarified at the hearing that he had admitted all of the SOR allegations under Guideline F. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.) (Tr. 9-10) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c.) Applicant failed to timely file, as required, his Federal and state income tax returns for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Applicant and his wife used a certified public accountant (CPA), a friend of his wife\u2019s, to prepare and file their income tax returns. In 2018, Applicant discovered that the CPA had not filed their 2017 tax returns. He spoke with his wife about the problem, and thought it was being handled. He then later found out that the CPA had not filed their 2018 tax returns either. The CPA had been diagnosed with cancer.

I admitted into evidence all proffered \nexhibits. I held the record open until December 20, 2022, in the event either party wanted \nto submit additional documentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nDecember 6, 2022. On December 20, 2022, Applicant submitted 12 documents, which I \nlabeled as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through L and admitted without objection. The record \nclosed on December 21, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 52 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2007. He has been \nmarried since 1996. He has two children with his current wife, and they also adopted his \nniece and nephew. He has four children before he became married in 1996. His youngest \ndaughter and nephew still reside in the home. Since 2007, he has been employed as an \nelectronic mechanic with a DOD contractor. This is his first application for a DOD security \nclearance. (Tr. 17-21; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleges financial considerations security concerns in that Applicant did \nnot timely file Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, and \n2020, and he owes delinquent Federal and state taxes. Since his Answer was unclear, \nApplicant clarified at the hearing that he had admitted all of the SOR allegations under \nGuideline F. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.) (Tr. 9-10) \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c.) Applicant failed to timely file, as required, his Federal and \nstate income tax returns for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Applicant and his wife used a \ncertified public accountant (CPA), a friend of his wife\u2019s, to prepare and file their income \ntax returns. In 2018, Applicant discovered that the CPA had not filed their 2017 tax \nreturns. He spoke with his wife about the problem, and thought it was being handled. He \nthen later found out that the CPA had not filed their 2018 tax returns either. The CPA had \nbeen diagnosed with cancer. They requested that the CPA return their tax paperwork, so \nthey could have these tax returns filed by another tax preparer. By the time Applicant \nsubmitted his security clearance application (SCA) in March 2021, he admitted that he \nwas aware they were seriously behind on filing their Federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2017-2019, and that they had also accumulated delinquent Federal and \nstate tax debt. (Tr. 22-24) \nAfter the submission of his March 2021 SCA, Applicant and his wife came up with \na plan to resolve their tax issues. His spouse tried two different tax companies, but the \ncompanies were unable to provide assistance. When Applicant responded to the \nGovernment interrogatories in November 2021, his IRS tax transcripts dated September \n2021 showed that they had not filed a Federal tax return for tax years 2017, 2019 and \n2020. His Federal tax transcript showed that their 2018 tax return was filed in May 2021. \n(Tr. 25-32; GE 2) \nApplicant provided Federal tax transcripts dated December 19, 2022, post-\nhearing. These documents showed that his 2017 Federal tax return was filed on \nSeptember 26, 2022, and his 2019 Federal tax return was filed on March 7, 2022.

The 2017, 2018, and 2019 state tax returns submitted with his \ninterrogatory were all undated. (AE B, AE C, AE G, AE H, AE I, AE J; Tr. 32-33) \nApplicant stated the problems associated with the untimely filing of their state and \nFederal tax returns were due to circumstances outside of their control. Their CPA was \ndiagnosed with cancer and they had difficulty trying to retrieve their tax papers from her. \nAt his hearing, he repeated his statement made in response to DOHA interrogatories that \nhis wife also attempted to hire two tax service companies to correct their tax issues, but \nthey were unable to provide assistance. In 2020, his wife\u2019s identity was stolen, and the \nfiling of her 2020 tax return involved a complicated process. Applicant provided email \ncommunication from their hired tax preparer, who notified his spouse in February 2022, \nthat the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had rejected the electronic filing of her 2020 tax \nreturn since it had been previously filed (due to identity theft.) The tax preparer informed \nher that he would have to file a paper tax return for 2020, and that it could cause some \ndelays. (AE A, AE E; Tr. 31-33) \n(SOR \u00b61.b) Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government in the approximate \namount of $15,406, for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Applicant did not provide \nany documentation about the current balance of his delinquent Federal tax debt, whether \nhe had arranged a payment plan, or made any tax payments to the IRS. A review of his \nFederal tax transcripts, and his signed tax return for tax year 2020, showed the \noutstanding delinquent taxes, as follows: \nTax Year 2017 - Transcript Owes - $27,296 \nTax Year 2018 - Transcript Owes -  $15,406 \nTax Year 2019 - Transcript Owes -    $5,378 \nTax Year 2020 \u2013 sign retrn Owes -    $1,815 \nThe total amount Applicant owes the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for \ntax years 2017-2020 is approximately $49,896. (GE 2; AE B, AE C, AE G) \n(SOR \u00b61.d) Applicant is indebted to his state of residence in the approximate \namount of $8,965 for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. He disclosed in his \nNovember 2021 interrogatory that he had arranged a payment plan with the state tax \ndepartment, and he was making monthly payments of $240. He submitted documentation \ndated December 2022 from the state department of revenue that showed he had made \n12 payments of $240 and the current balance of his outstanding state tax was $12,530. \nIt is unclear if this amount was for a specific tax year, or whether it was a combined total \nof all of his delinquent state taxes. His signed 2020 state tax return showed $2,586 was \nowed to the state, and the 2021 state tax return showed $1,842 was owed to the state. \n(GE 2; AE H, AE J, AE K; Tr. 34-35) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in\nillegal acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not timely file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2017, 2018, \n2019, and 2020. His delinquent Federal income taxes for tax years 2017 through 2020 \ntotal approximately $50,000, and his outstanding taxes owed to the state are \napproximately $13,000. These debts have been delinquent for several years, and they \nremain delinquent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n . . . suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with well-\nestablished governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nsuch rules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. \nISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we have noted \nin the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same \ntoken, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. \nRather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and \nreliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria \n& Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. \nCir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has commented that an Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nincome tax returns (or, as alleged here, to address resulting tax debt): \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. His failure \nto timely file his Federal and state income tax returns persisted for four consecutive years. \nAfter his discovery in 2018 that their 2017 tax returns had not been filed due to the CPA\u2019s \nillness, he should have taken immediate steps to remedy the situation. Instead, three \nmore years followed with his Federal and state tax returns not being filed on time. It \nappears that only after he applied for a DOD security clearance that he finally decided to \ntake action to resolve his tax issues. \nApplicant\u2019s excuse that his wife\u2019s identity was stolen and caused them to file their \n2020 Federal income tax return late is not supported by evidence in the record. The email \ncommunication dated February 2022, from their tax preparer stated that he (tax preparer) \nhad just been notified by the IRS that the electronic filing of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s 2020 tax \nreturn was rejected due to a 2020 tax return already filed under her social security \nnumber. At this point in time, Applicant and his wife were unaware of the fraud, but it is \nclear from this communication that their 2020 income tax return had been filed late \nnonetheless. In fact, the identity theft had nothing to do with the untimely filing of their \n2020 Federal tax return. \nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he established a payment plan with the state tax department, \nand has made 12 payments to reduce his delinquent state tax debt. The problem, \nhowever, is that his state tax debt has continued to increase, not decrease, since the \nSOR was issued. The amount originally alleged in the SOR was $8,965, and it has now \ngrown to approximately $12,530. It is important to note that his Federal tax debt, originally \nalleged in the SOR as $15,406, is now approximately $50,000. Applicant did not provide \nany evidence that he has arranged a payment plan, or that he has made any payments \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \non this significant Federal tax debt. These tax delinquencies have persisted for several \nyears and are still unresolved. \nApplicant did not demonstrate that his tax delinquencies arose from conditions \nbeyond his control and that he acted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve \nthese issues. There is no evidence of any debt-resolution efforts with the Federal \ngovernment, and despite making 12 payments towards his delinquent state tax debt, the \nbalance of this debt has continued to grow. None of the financial considerations mitigation \nconditions apply. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s untimely filing of his Federal and state income taxes continued for four \nconsecutive years. As such, he developed significant outstanding tax debt to both the \nstate and Federal government. He has made payments towards his state tax debt, but \ndespite these payments, his state tax debt has continued to increase over time. He has \nnot provided sufficient documentation that he is arranging a payment plan, or made any \npayments to the Federal government for approximately $50,000 of delinquent tax debt \nbeyond filing his tax returns and having some funds withheld from his salary. Given his \nburden to demonstrate reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment, I conclude \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.d.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

She married her first husband in June 1998; they divorced in November 2000. She married her second husband in August 2005; they divorced in May 2009. Since February 2016, she has worked full-time for a defense contractor. (GE 3; Tr. 17.) Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant is past due for $7,837 on a loan whose total balance is $39,687. The SOR also alleged that she is past due for $21,549 on a mortgage whose total balance is $191,579. (SOR \u00b6 1.) She admitted both allegations, with explanations during her testimony. From June 2007 until December 2020, she and her family lived in the home that is the subject of the two SOR allegations (the Townhouse). (Answer; Tr. 23; GE 1.) Direct Testimony. Applicant testified that she bought the Townhouse in 2007. In 2008 the market crashed. Almost immediately her home mortgage was underwater. As the mortgage remained underwater for years during the financial crisis, COVID struck. She contacted the mortgage company to try a short sale. It denied that, saying she could use COVID relief. But she could not afford to sell the Townhouse without a short sale. She also asked about a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgage company said it was not doing those because of the President\u2019s mandate against foreclosures during COVID. (Tr. 15.) Applicant testified that the Townhouse wa",

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 5, 2022. The \ncase was assigned to me on November 17, 2022. On January 9, 2023, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to be \nconducted in person on February 2, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The \nGovernment submitted Exhibits marked (GE) 1 through 11, which were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted two exhibits, which were \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on February 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 42 years old and has two sons ages 19 and 20, who live with her. She \nand her cohabitant have lived together since January 2008. She married her first husband \nin June 1998; they divorced in November 2000. She married her second husband in \nAugust 2005; they divorced in May 2009. Since February 2016, she has worked full-time \nfor a defense contractor. (GE 3; Tr. 17.) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant is past due for $7,837 on a loan \nwhose total balance is $39,687. The SOR also alleged that she is past due for $21,549 \non a mortgage whose total balance is $191,579. (SOR \u00b6 1.) She admitted both \nallegations, with explanations during her testimony. From June 2007 until December \n2020, she and her family lived in the home that is the subject of the two SOR allegations \n(the Townhouse). (Answer; Tr. 23; GE 1.) \nDirect Testimony. Applicant testified that she bought the Townhouse in 2007. In \n2008 the market crashed. Almost immediately her home mortgage was underwater. As \nthe mortgage remained underwater for years during the financial crisis, COVID struck. \nShe contacted the mortgage company to try a short sale. It denied that, saying she could \nuse COVID relief. But she could not afford to sell the Townhouse without a short sale. \nShe also asked about a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgage company said it was \nnot doing those because of the President\u2019s mandate against foreclosures during COVID. \n(Tr. 15.) \nApplicant testified that the Townhouse was never refinanced, but the mortgage \nloan might have been sold a few times. It was an 80/20 loan. That was what mortgage \ncompanies were doing in 2007. It was an interest-only loan. She was trying to get out of \nthe loan, because she was having problems with rodents getting into the Townhouse. \nShe could not stop them, because her home was connected to everyone else in that row. \nShe could only clean up and close holes in her home. She also found a copperhead snake \nin her basement. (Tr. 15-16.) \nAt this point, Applicant offered two exhibits. The first, marked AEA, was identified \nas a Judgment of Absolute Divorce dated May 6, 2009, captioned XYZ v. Applicant, in \nthe Circuit Court for State A. (XYZ was her second husband. GE 1.) AEA involves the \ndisposition of her and her second husband\u2019s home (the Marital Home).

(Tr. 16-17.) \nCross-Examination. Applicant works for a contracting company doing Information \nTechnology. She has worked there for seven years. Her annual gross pay is about \n$85,000. She has worked full-time for a federal contractor since 2001. She has had a \nSecret security clearance since 2011, and her current employer is her security clearance \nsponsor. (Tr. 18-20.) \nApplicant\u2019s cohabitant works in construction and makes about $45,000 per year. \nHe is the father of both her sons. She, her sons, and her cohabitant live in State A (the \nResidence). She is on the deed for the Residence, but not on the loan. She is not on the \nloan, because she did not want to be on the loan. She helps with household bills but not \nwith the mortgage. She is asked about a $711 per month rental charge on GE 5. That \nrent is for her son\u2019s apartment when he is at college. Neither of her sons pay rent to her \ncohabitant, nor do they help with the mortgage. Only one of her sons is in college; the \nother son works. (Tr. 20-22.) \nApplicant was questioned about the SOR. When she bought the Townhouse in \n2007, she did not intend it to be a rental property. The purchase price was $225,000. After \nthe purchase, she and her family moved in. Asked about its market value now, she was \nunsure, \u201clike $200,000, maybe.\u201d She was asked whether online estimates of $224,000 \nand $253,000 seemed \u201cabout right.\u201d She answered \u201cno;\u201d they were \u201ctoo high.\u201d She based \nher $200,000 on \u201cother ones that have sold recently in the area.\u201d (Tr. 22-24.) \nApplicant was referred to GE 2, page 7, account 11. (GE 2 is a credit report of  \n2/24/2022.) The \u201copening date\u201d is when she bought the Townhouse in June 2007.  But \nthe $180,000 high credit is not the only loan; she bought the Townhouse for $225,000. \nThere were two loans \u201ctechnically.\u201d The other loan was for $45,000, for a total of \n$225,000, the sale price. She did not use her own money for a down payment. She \nconfirmed that she never refinanced her Townhouse mortgages, saying: \u201cHow can you \nrefinance a loan that\u2019s under water?\u201d Applicant was asked if the \u201cbank has changed \npayments?\u201d She replied that: \u201c[They] sell loans. I didn\u2019t do it. It was \u2013 the banks.\u201d (Tr. 25-\n27.)   \nApplicant was referred to GE 4, page 5, top two entries. (GE 4 is a credit report of \n8/2/2011.) She was asked how the $180,000 loan balance was reduced by only $22 in \nfour years. She explained that it was an interest-only loan. She testified that was what \nmortgage companies were doing in 2007. That was the only way she could get a loan \nand \u201cout of the of the house to get away from my ex-husband with my children.\u201d She \nexplained that the $45,000 loan balance was reduced by only $222, because it too was \nan interest-only loan. (Tr. 27- 31.) \nApplicant was asked why she stopped paying her two Townhouse mortgages in \nApril or May 2020. She stopped paying to qualify for a short sale. The mortgage company \nsaid since she was paying on time, \u201cthey wouldn\u2019t work with me.\u201d They did not approve \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher short sale. She has not paid on the Townhouse mortgages, since the spring of 2020. \nShe moved out in December 2020. The mortgage companies are in the process of \nforeclosure. (Tr. 31-32.) \nApplicant was asked if she hired an exterminator about the snake. She did not but \nsaid: \u201cWe went around the house. We closed up all the holes like you\u2019re supposed to. \nYou know, you put vents on the thing. We did everything we could do.\u201d A neighbor came \nin and killed the snake. She never saw another snake, but she did not stay long after the \nphoto of the snake (AEB) was taken in June 2020. Her Townhouse was a middle unit, \nwith units on the left and right. She tried her best to close up holes or gaps between her \nTownhouse and her neighbors. But \u201cstuff was still getting in.\u201d The Townhouse complex \nis in the country surrounded by woods. (Tr. 23-24, 33-34. \nAfter moving out in the summer of 2020, Applicant has never tried to rent or sell \nthe Townhouse. She has keys to the Townhouse but believes the bank has changed the \nlocks. She was referred to GE 11, page 7, account 13. (GE 11 is a credit report of \n1/23/2023.) She \u201chad no clue\u201d her mortgage account had been transferred until she saw \nGE 11. She received nothing in the mail from the new mortgagee shown on GE 11. Every \nonce in a while she receives statements from the lender shown in SOR \u00b6 1.b. but no \nphone calls. She submitted paperwork for her short sale request, but that lender denied \nit. (Tr. 34-37.) \nApplicant\u2019s short sale was denied, because the bank kept saying she could use \nCOVID relief. She no longer felt safe in the house, and her family had outgrown the \nTownhouse. She tried to hold on to it as long as she could. She understood that the \nCOVID program could be a pause on the payments or lower the mortgage payments but \nwould not get her out of her underwater loan. (Tr. 37-38.) \nApplicant has nothing in writing from a real estate broker as to what her Townhouse \ncould sell for. She has not spoken with one since she left in December 2020, because \nshe was trying to work with the banks. Her opinion that the Townhouse is worth about \n$200,000 is based on comparable sales in the area. When she left the Townhouse, \u201cthey \nwere going for a lot less.\u201d Her plan is to keep working with the mortgage company, but it \nhas \u201csold it [the mortgage] again, so she will need \u201cto track down the latest number [for \nthe latest mortgage holder].\u201d (Tr. 38-39.) \nApplicant was referred to GE 10, page 2, second paragraph. (GE 10 is the \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) of 9/2/2021.) She was asked if it was still her plan to let \nthe Townhouse go into foreclosure, if she cannot work out a sale? She answered: \u201cThe \nloan is underwater. I mean I\u2019m trying to work with the mortgage company. I can\u2019t afford to \npay the difference of what I owe and what the house would sell for.\u201d In the PSI, she said \nshe could not \u201cmaintain two mortgages.\u201d She clarified that it is \u201cnot really a mortgage.\u201d \nShe is paying household bills at her current Residence. (Tr. 39-40.) \nWhen Applicant lived in the Townhouse, she did not pay homeowner\u2019s association \nfees. She was responsible for outside upkeep. After she left, she and a neighbor mowed \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe yard; it was very little. The Townhouse still has water, but when she left, she turned \noff the electricity. She is up to date with all utilities. (Tr. 40.) \nApplicant was referred to GE 11, account 12. The entry shows a joint mortgage. \nShe confirmed that the mortgage is on her parents\u2019 house. She is on that mortgage. Her \nfather lost his job. So, she signed on to the loan, so her parents would not lose their \nhouse. It was not a refinancing.  They bought the house in about 2005. She pays nothing \non their house. She has never helped them pay the mortgage. She believes she is on the \ndeed. If her parents sold the house, she would not receive any of the proceeds. (Tr. 41-\n42.) \nApplicant was referred to GE 6. (GE 6 is a Notice of Default of 10/20/2009.) She \nconfirmed that this is about a foreclosure on the Marital Home she owned with her second \nhusband. She was referred to GE 4, page 4, the last entry. (GE 4 is a credit report of \n8/2/2011.) She believes that transaction was a transfer, not a refinance. She was not \ninvolved in that transfer; it was all handled by her second husband. There was no \ndeficiency. (Tr. 42-44.) \nApplicant testified that she does not have any delinquent or collection accounts \nthat have not been discussed during the hearing. Applicant was referred to GE 11, page \n4, account 3. That account was opened in July 2022, with a balance of $16,130. She was \nasked why the balance was so high. She explained that there were car issues, braces, \nwisdom teeth pulled, and college. (Tr. 44-45.) \nDepartment Counsel asked a series of questions about Applicant\u2019s personal \nfinances and spending habits. Her answers did not prompt any follow-up by Department \nCounsel. Cross-examination ended. Tr. 45-48.) \nRedirect Testimony. Applicant testified that they had mice in the Townhouse. \nThey were getting into the kitchen. It was so bad \u201call the food had to go into containers \njust to keep them out.\u201d When she was trying to qualify for a short sale, she had to be in \ndefault before the lender \u201cwould even talk to [her] about it.\u201d She reiterated that COVID \nrelief would not help her with the loan being underwater. It would lower her payments for \nperhaps six months but would not help sell the house. Applicant provided a third page to \ncomplete AEA. (Tr. 50-53.) \nRecross-examination. No new material information was gleaned during re-cross. \n(Tr. 52-53.) \nApplicant\u2019s relevant credit history follows: \n2011: GE 4, page 7 shows both Townhouse mortgages to be Pays As Agreed. At \npage 6, there is a foreclosure reported where the creditor \u201creclaimed the collateral to settle \ndefaulted mortgage.\u201d This appears to be the Marital Home, the foreclosure of which under \ncourt order was handled by Applicant\u2019s former husband. All other accounts are Pays as \nAgreed. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2021: GE 3, pages 2 and 3 show both Townhouse mortgages past due. All other \naccounts are Pays As Agreed. \n2022: GE 2, accounts 7 and 11 show both Townhouse mortgages past due. All \nother accounts have no balances past due. \n2023: GE 11, accounts 13 and 18 show both Townhouse mortgages past due. All \nother accounts have no balances past due. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n    Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by her admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. From February 2016, she has been employed full-time by her current \nemployer. Before that, since 2001, she worked for federal contractors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n(b) apply.  \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and,  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant bought the Townhouse in June 2007 for $225,000. It was in a complex, \nand she had neighbors adjoining on either side. It was in a rustic area. She moved in with \nher two sons, then ages four and five. Shortly thereafter, her cohabitant, the father of her \nboys, also took up residence there. She never had any intention of renting out the \nTownhouse. She never refinanced the Townhouse. \nThe purchase price was financed by an 80/20 loan. The down payment of $45,000 \nwas financed by one lender, and the balance of $180,000 was financed by another lender. \nBoth loans were interest-only loans. That meant Applicant did not have to use any of her \nown money to complete the purchase. And she could remain current on her home \npayments by paying the interest only on both loans. It also meant, however, that her \ninterest-only payments would not be applied to reduce the capital amounts of either loan. \nShe was asked why by 2011 the first loan\u2019s principal only decreased by $22 and the \nsecond loan\u2019s principal only decreased by $222. She explained that they were interest-\nonly loans. Very little of her monthly payments reduced the principal. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNot long after Applicant moved in, the financial crisis of 2008 struck. Almost \nimmediately her home loans were underwater. Nevertheless, she planned to do her best \nkeep the Townhouse. But as the housing market continued to slump, she made \nnumerous efforts to do a short sale. The mortgage lenders, however, denied her requests. \nAnd by that time, COVID was in full bloom. So lenders rejected her short sale requests \nand instead recommended she use COVID relief programs. She declined, because those \nprograms would only pause or reduce mortgage payments for a short time but would not \nhelp her underwater loans. She also inquired about doing a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. \nLenders responded that they were not using those because of the President\u2019s COVID \nmandate against such transactions. Asked why she did not refinance the Townhouse, \nshe replied: \u201cHow can you refinance a loan that\u2019s underwater?\u201d \nAt the hearing, Applicant was asked about the current market value of her \nTownhouse. Specifically, she was asked whether an online estimate of between $224,000 \nand $253,000 sounded about right. She said they were too high, that $200,000, or \nperhaps less, was maybe closer. She based her estimates on other townhouses that were \nsold recently in the area. Her opinion of her home\u2019s current value is reliable evidence. \nSee, e.g., Sabal Trail Transmission, LLC v. 3921 Acres of Land, 947 F.3d 1362, 1368-69 \n(11th  Cir. 2020). Using $253,000 as the current value yields a 12% appreciation in 13 \nyears, or less than 1% per year. That is hardly a robust appreciation. Using Applicant\u2019s \nestimate puts the mortgages still underwater.  \nDuring Applicant\u2019s residence in the Townhouse from June 2007 until she and her \nfamily moved out in December 2020, problems developed. Principal of which was an \ninfestation of rodents entering the premises and being in the kitchen. It was so bad that \nshe had to store food stuffs in containers. She plugged up holes and areas of entry and \nused vents, as recommended, but to no avail. In June 2020, she discovered a copperhead \nsnake in her basement. (A neighbor came in and killed it.) She no longer felt safe in the \nTownhouse. \nIn addition to the rodents, the snake, and the decline or stasis in its market value, \nthe Townhouse no longer fit her family\u2019s needs. Her sons are now 19 and 20. Applicant \nagain applied for a short sale. She was told that to qualify, she needed to be in default of \nher mortgages. That is why she stopped paying her mortgages in the spring of 2020. She \ntestified that she had to be in default before the lender \u201cwould even talk to [her] about it.\u201d \nIt is common for lenders to require that a borrower be in default before considering a short \nsale or a foreclosure. See James Chen, What is a Short Sale on a House? Process, \nAlternatives, and Mistakes to Avoid, May 22, 2022. https://www.investopedia.com. The \nrecord is consistent with her testimony. From her clean 2011 credit report there is no past \ndue amount on the Townhouse until her 2021 credit report, about a year after she vacated \nthe Townhouse and stopped paying her mortgages in the spring of 2020. She is now \nworking with the lenders to accomplish a short sale or let the Townhouse go to \nforeclosure. Other than the default status of the Townhouse, her credit reports are \nflawless. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant bought the Townhouse in June 2007. She and her family lived there for \n13 years, and she faithfully paid her mortgages. She only stopped paying the mortgages \nin the spring of 2020, when lenders told her she needed to be in default to qualify for a \nshort sale. In the meantime, Applicant has continued to maintain the Townhouse. She \nand a neighbor mow the small lawn and keep up the outside. It still has water, but she cut \noff the electricity. She is current on all utilities. \nApplicant\u2019s defaults on the Townhouse mortgages were first reported on the 2021 \ncredit report. Those defaults are the only blemishes on her credit history. The 2008 \nfinancial crisis complicated by three years of COVID, we hope, are unlikely to recur. They \nare also conditions \u201clargely beyond\u201d her control. She continued to pay her mortgages, \nuntil told by lenders that she needed to be in default to do a short sale. That was \nresponsible conduct. The unusual adverse circumstances Applicant confronted and how \nshe dealt with them do not cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. I conclude that her SOR debts are mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and (b). Therefore, \nI find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-b.: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems, including her failure to timely file multiple, \nconsecutive years of federal and state income tax returns trigger the application of AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial problems began after her ex-husband, upon whom she \nwas dependent to help make ends meet, became seriously ill and addicted to painkillers \nduring his treatment, subsequently leading to the loss of his job. \nSince Applicant\u2019s salary began steadily increasing in 2018, she has gradually \nbegan satisfying her delinquent debts and catching up on her income tax return filings. In \nthe process, she has crafted a budget, credibly disputed one of the debts by retaining an \nattorney to assist her, and she retained a professional tax preparer to help her file her tax \nreturns. I conclude that the following mitigating conditions are applicable: \n20(a) the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n20(d) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nCurrently, Applicant\u2019s only outstanding debt is the amount due after her car was \ntotaled in an accident, leaving her unable to pay the difference between what the \ninsurance company reimbursed her, and what she owed on the car note. It certainly would \nhave been prudent for Applicant to have purchased GAP insurance when she bought the \ncar; however, she could not afford it. The fact that the creditor has charged off this debt \nis not mitigating. Any negative inference triggered by her inability to pay this debt before \nand since the creditor charged it off is outweighed when viewed in light of the origins of \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties, her steps to remedy her financial problems, her payment \nof all of the other SOR debts, and her current financial stability. On balance, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, particularly, the circumstances surrounding the origin of the problem \nand the current, significant presence of rehabilitation. \nFindings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has been married to his wife since 2018, and he \nhas a 12-year-old stepson, whom he has raised since his stepson was a toddler. He \nattended technical school courses during his junior and senior years of high school, and \nin 2000, he received a high school diploma from the technical school.

(GE 1-3; GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 10-11, 17-20) \nApplicant told the government investigator during his August 2020 background \ninterview that he spent most of his time between 1999 (when he was 18) and 2013 \neither working or partying. His typical week consisted of going out to a bar three to four \nnights, where he would consume seven to eight beers and have a few shots. If he was \nnot at the bar drinking, he was at home smoking marijuana. His testimony described a \ndifferent drinking pattern between 1999 and approximately 2015, when he worked night \nshifts in the restaurant industry. He testified that during this period, he typically \nconsumed one or two cocktails at his workplace after his shifts ended, and then drove to \nhis home, where he would consume more alcohol. He would drink, \u201cMaybe a 6-pack [of \nbeer] and a couple of shots or, you know, maybe more shots and not so many beers.\u201d It \ntypically took eight to ten drinks for him to feel intoxicated, and this pattern occurred five \nto six times a week. (GE 2; Tr. 21-26, 41-42) \nIn 2013, Applicant experienced \u201csome very, very low points\u201d in his life. He quit \nusing drugs after he borrowed money for his drug use and realized \u201cit was time to \nchange [his] life.\u201d He testified that he quit using drugs, stopped drinking alcohol as \nheavily, but he continued to consume between a six-pack to a 12-pack of beer two to \nthree times a week at home. However, during his October 2021 psychological \nevaluation, mentioned below, he stated that after he discontinued using drugs in 2013, \nhis alcohol consumption increased rather than decreased. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 26-27) \nApplicant started taking antidepressant medications in 2013, and he was \nprescribed testosterone medication in 2018. In 2020, he started to experience high and \nlow mood swings. He drank more during the downswings, which occurred \napproximately two to three times a month. Additionally, during the downswings, he often \ndrank to the point that he blacked out, and he was drinking not just to drink, but to \nforget.

It had been his birthday, and he \ndrank 10 to 12 beers and a few shots. He ultimately admitted that he consumed alcohol \nat this level two or three times a month and that he was experiencing alcohol-related \nblackouts two or three times a month. (GE 2; Tr. 28-29) \nIn October 2021, Applicant was referred for an independent psychological \nevaluation by the DOD Consolidated Adjudication Facility (CAF) for the purpose of \nanswering the following question: \u201cDoes the [Applicant] have any medical, psychiatric, \nemotional, or substance use condition which could impair his judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness.\u201d In reaching her opinion, the licensed psychologist (LP) conducted a \ntwo-hour interview and administered the Psychological Assessment Inventory (PAI) and \nthe Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-4). The LP also reviewed and \nrelied upon documents provided by the CAF, including Applicant\u2019s August 2020 \ninterview and his 2018 security clearance application (SCA). The LP determined that \nApplicant met the criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe, and concluded that his \nprognosis was guarded to fair. She recommended that he refrain from consuming shots \nof hard liquor and continue to limit his drinking. (GE 3) \nApplicant told the LP that, in October 2021, he was drinking three times a week, \nprimarily on the weekends, and consuming a maximum of four to five beers. He blacked \nout from drinking three or four times after his August 2020 interview, and the last time \nhe blacked out was in approximately June 2021. During his blackouts, he had no \nmemory of what occurred until he woke up in the morning. (GE 3) \nApplicant testified that he stopped drinking just before the DOD evaluation. \nHowever, at the hearing, he disclosed that he consumes \u201c[m]aybe a beer or two here \nand there.\u201d He testified that he had not been intoxicated since October 2021, and the \nmost he has consumed at one time since the 2021 evaluation is four beers. Before the \nhearing date, he consumed two beers, at home, eight or nine days earlier over the \nweekend. He currently drinks alcohol two to three times a month. (Tr. 26-40) \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted he reduced his alcohol consumption in 2021, \nbecause he was afraid of losing his wife and stepson. He also told the LP that he \nreduced his drinking, because he did not want to risk hurting himself or anyone else. \nWhen Applicant changed his level of alcohol consumption, he started going to the gym \nmore, helping his stepson practice baseball, and took up woodworking as a hobby. \nApplicant disclosed to the government investigator that his wife expressed concern that \nhe becomes angry when he is intoxicated. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr. 36-40, 44) \nApplicant has never attended an alcohol-treatment program or Alcoholics \nAnonymous (AA) meetings. He did not obtain an updated evaluation prior to the \nhearing. He received a copy of the DOD evaluation in September 2022, and at that time \nhe considered discontinuing all consumption of alcohol, because he was concerned \nabout losing his job and his clearance.

He hoped that after he finished the pledge, he would \nhave a better handle on his alcohol consumption. In October 2021, he told the LP that \nhe discontinued the 75-day challenge after approximately 10 days due to the challenge \nof not eating sugar. (GE 2; GE 3; Tr.40, 44-45, 47-48) \nDuring cross-examination, Applicant was asked about his history of driving while \nintoxicated. He claimed that if he had ever driven over the legal limit, it was after \nconsuming two to three drinks when he was younger and still working in the restaurant \nindustry. However, he told the DOD evaluator that he had driven while intoxicated two \nyears prior to his October 2021 evaluation. He has never been arrested for alcohol-\nrelated issues. The issue regarding Applicant driving while intoxicated was not alleged \nin the SOR and will not be considered as disqualifying conduct; however, it may be \nconsidered in assessing mitigation and whole-person applicability. (Tr. 3, 20, 46) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following two \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22: \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline. Two are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \nApplicant has admitted to a history of consuming alcohol in excess and to the \npoint of intoxication from 1999 to at least October 2021. He experienced multiple \nblackouts between 2000 and June 2021, and he drove under the influence of alcohol as \nrecently as 2019. In August 2020, he disclosed during his interview with a government \ninvestigator that his alcohol consumption was negatively affecting his relationship with \nhis wife and causing him to experience blackouts. As a result, he was referred for a \npsychological evaluation, and he was subsequently diagnosed by a duly qualified \nprofessional with Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s diagnosis, he continues to consume alcohol, in a reduced \namount, and denies that he has been intoxicated or \u201cblacked out\u201d since October 2021. \nHe has not sought treatment or attended AA, nor did he provide documentation or \ncorroborating testimony of his modified behavior. Other than his testimony, he \npresented no evidence of a pattern of responsible use of alcohol. Given his lengthy \nhistory of abusing alcohol, his inconsistent testimony regarding driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol, and his relatively short period of modified behavior, I have lingering \nconcerns regarding his suitability to hold a security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) do \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline G in my whole-person analysis. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nApplicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings  \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption: \nAGAINST Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

All of the SOR debts are reported on the July 2021 credit \nbureau report. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.e are reported on the February 2022 credit bureau report. \nOnly SOR \u00b6 3.d is reported on the August 2022 and May 2023 credit bureau reports. \n(Answer; Tr. at 17-18, 31; GE 1, 3-6) \nApplicant stated that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.b-3.f were credit cards that were fraudulently \nopened in his name, and he did not learn about them until he underwent the security \nclearance process in 2021 and the background investigator informed him about them.

He stated that he was communicating with the \ncreditor for SOR \u00b6 3.d and attempting to recoup the money he paid to resolve that debt \nbecause he did not recognize it as his, as he has only one credit card with this same \ncreditor. He also stated that he has had ongoing issues with not receiving medical bills \nrelated to one of his child\u2019s frequent visits to various doctors for a medical condition, and \nthat the medical debt in SOR \u00b6 3.a was one such bill. He acknowledged that he was \npreviously not the best at monitoring his credit report. (Tr. at 17-18, 31-33, 49-61) \nApplicant stated that he paid all the SOR debts prior to receiving the SOR.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;\u201d and \n\u201c(c) individual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d \nApplicant was arrested in 2019 and charged with five felony offenses, and he pled \nguilty to larceny of checks and identity theft. Although he completed probation, he is still \non a deferred sentence until February 2025. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides the following relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nI recognize that this is Applicant\u2019s sole criminal offense, four years have since \npassed, and he is endeavoring to not let this incident define him. He also disclosed this \ninformation on his 2021 security clearance application, and he was candid, sincere, and \nremorseful at the hearing and he accepted responsibility for his actions. I commend his \nmentorship as a children\u2019s sports coach. However, he is still on a deferred sentence until \nFebruary 2025 for his felony conviction. As such, I find that not enough time has elapsed \nsince his criminal behavior and without recurrence of criminal activity, and the record \nevidence still casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) \nand 32(d) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nApplicant displayed untrustworthiness, questionable judgment, and unreliability, \nwhich led to his 2019 conviction and general discharge under honorable conditions for \nmisconduct. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \u00b6 AG 17 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nFor the same reasons set forth above in my Guideline J analysis, I find that \u00b6\u00b6 AG \n17(c), 17(d), and 17(e) are not established. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. He paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.c and \n3.e-f, and he disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 3.b in June 2023. He also paid the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 3.f in 2021, before the SOR. He does not have any other delinquent debts. Although he \nhas not received financial counseling, he and his wife utilize a budget to track their \nexpenses. His finances are under control, and they do not continue to cast doubt on his \njudgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(e) are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, E, and F in \nmy whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not mitigate \nthe criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f: \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $17,738 for an account \nthat was charged off. In 2016, he purchased a new 2016 Electric Kia for $30, 818, that \nhe was financing. Four months after purchasing the car, he realized that he could not \nafford to continue making the $500 monthly payments, and he did not have access to a \ncharging station. Applicant called the creditor and asked them to pick up the car. They \ntold him to stop making payments on the account first. He stopped making payments, \nand the car was eventually repossessed and sold at auction. Applicant owes the \ndeficiency amount left on the loan after the sale. The debt remains owing. (Tr. p. 35, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n1.b. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $950 for an account \nthat was charged off. He explained that he went to a dentist and applied for their credit \ncard. This was for the dental bill.  Applicant paid the debt off in September 2022.  (Tr. p. \n39 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \n1.c. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $383 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. This is car insurance that Applicant purchased. He \ncancelled it because he found a cheaper insurance. Applicant paid off the debt on May \n20, 2022.  (Tr. p. 41, Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Government Exhibit 6.) \n1.d. Applicant was indebted to a creditor in the amount of $172 for an account \nthat was placed for collection. Applicant does not remember what the debt was for but \ndoes know that he settled the debt for $126.16 on May 20, 2022. (Tr, pp. 41-42, and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n1.e. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $8,246 for the purchase \nof a used Nissan Ultima that he purchased in March 2017. The account was placed for \ncollection. Applicant explained that he had no insurance on the car when he was in a \ncar accident which totaled the car in May 2017. Following the car accident, the tow \ntruck dropped the car off at his apartment. It was being financed through General \nMotors. The car was sold at auction for scraps. Applicant owed the deficiency amount \nof $8,000. Applicant confirms that the creditor plans to send him a Form 1099 C. (Tr. \npp. 42-46.) An excerpt from Applicant\u2019s Experian credit report indicates that it was \n\u201clegally paid in full for less that the full balance\u201d.

(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties due to his irresponsibility. His \nactions or inactions both demonstrate a history of not addressing his debt and/or an \ninability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n5 \n   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt that he could not afford to pay. It was only \nafter receiving the SOR that he made some effort to resolve his debts. His financial \nirresponsibility and inaction casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. Applicant now realizes his mistakes of the past and understands that \nhe must be financially responsible and live within his means if he is to obtain a security \nclearance in the future. Applicant has recently hired a Credit Repair Agency to assist \nhim with his finances. It would also be beneficial for Applicant to take some finance \nclasses to improve his ability to control his spending and to make rational and \nreasonable decisions. At this time, he has not sufficiently resolved his delinquent debt, \nnor has he demonstrated a systematic method of payment. He must work diligently to \nimprove his financial status and to achieve a security clearance. At this time, Applicant \nneeds more time to show the Government that he will properly resolve his financial \ndelinquencies with regular systematic payments and consistency. \nNone of the \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant has made a \ngood faith effort to resolve his debts. Overall, Applicant has a good employment record, \nis well liked on the job, and has potential in the future if he changes his ways. He must \nshow progress towards properly managing his finances. This means paying his bills on \ntime and living within his means. Applicant still owes a significant amount of money to \none of his creditors, and he has yet begun to resolve the debt. There is insufficient \nevidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to \nestablish mitigation of the government security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.e.  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b., 1.c., and 1.d. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

During his last deployment, Applicant was seriously injured and became \npermanently and 100 percent disabled. He receives $4,200 a month for his disability. \nIn March 2018, he received an honorable discharge, and retired as an Staff Sergeant, \nE-5. (Tr. pp. 21-22.) \nApplicant explained that his delinquent financial history started during his first \ndeployment in the military. (Tr. p. 32.) Applicant was married to his first wife from 2011 \nto 2015. His wife did not work outside of the home. During his first deployment, his wife \nhad access to his bank account, and was supposed to pay the household bills and keep \neverything current. Instead, she enjoyed buying expensive designer hand bags and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n     \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n  \nother luxury items. She was not educated on how to properly manage finances. She \nmade minimum payments toward some of the debts and others she ignored. At the \ntime of their divorce in 2015, Applicant was indebted in the amount of $60,000. (Tr. pp. \n33 and 39.) \nIn 2017, Applicant married his second wife. At the time they were married, \nApplicant was leaving on deployment, and they never moved in together. She lived with \nher parents and she stayed there. She had access to Applicant\u2019s bank account and she \nwas expected to pay his household bills for him while he was deployed. Unbeknownst \nto the Applicant, she did not pay the bills. Instead, she spent his money on other things, \nbut he is not sure what she purchased. \nDuring his last deployment, Applicant was seriously injured when a forklift hit him \nin the head causing traumatic brain injury, and a broken knee and back. (Tr. p. 22.) In \nMarch 2018, Applicant was discharged from the Air Force. At that time, he moved in \nwith his mother who helped take care of him. He received unemployment benefits, and \nunderwent extensive therapy and rehabilitation at VA medical facilities. (Tr. p. 40.) \nApplicant was not aware of the extent of his financial indebtedness until he started \nreceiving letters from creditors that told him how much debt he owed. By this time, \nApplicant\u2019s debt had increased from $60,000 to $240,000. (Tr. p. 40.) He divorced his \nsecond wife in 2019. (Tr. p. 23.) \nUpon learning of the debt, Applicant contacted each of the creditors to set up a \npayment plan. \nHe also contacted an attorney and was advised to file for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy to discharge his debt. A letter from his attorney dated August 24, 2022, \nconfirms the arrangement. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.) Applicant found it difficult to contact \nthis attorney, and as a result, was not able to make progress towards resolving his \ndebts. (Tr. p. 47.) \nIn May 2023, Applicant hired another law firm to help him. This law \nfirm moved swiftly, and filed the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition in June 2023. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Tr. p. 48.) Applicant stated that each of the creditors listed in \nthe SOR were named in the in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nC.) The debts are not yet discharged. \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $32,848 for an account \nthat was charged off. This is a delinquent credit card. The debt has been included in \nthe Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition filed in June 2023. The debt remains owing. \n1.b.

Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $15,269 for an account \nthat was charged off. This is a delinquent credit card.

It is unclear from the evidence whether this \ndebt is the same debt listed in 1.h., or whether this is a separate debt. The debt \nremains owing. \nApplicant is currently working with his attorney to get his debts discharged as \nsoon as possible. Applicant has learned from this experience and understands that he \nmust be extremely careful in handling his finances to ensure that his bills are always \npaid on time, and that he lives within his means. He stated that he plans to never use \ncredit cards again. \nApplicant has a new girlfriend who works as a Program Manager and earns \nabout $120,000 annually. He stated that she is financially responsible. Applicant earns \nabout $99,000 annually, not including overtime and bonuses. (Tr. p. 19.) They have a \ndaughter who was born in 2021.

He plans \non marrying his girlfriend in the near future. \nNine letters of recommendation from coworkers and military associates indicate \nthat Applicant is an upstanding citizen and a hard worker. He is always professional \nand respectful. \nHe follows all company rules and regulations concerning how to \nproperly protect classified information. Applicant has given them no reason to question \nhis honestly, trustworthiness and reliability. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt while in the military on deployment. He was \nunder the impression that his wife at the time, who had access to his bank account, \nwould pay the household bills when in fact his bills were not properly addressed. This \nestablished a history of financial hardship. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant became delinquently indebted because his ex-wives were not \nfinancially responsible. He made the mistake of trusting them. He has now learned that \nhe cannot trust anyone with the responsibility of paying his bills. Applicant has recently \ndirected his focus at resolving his delinquent debts. \nHe has filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy and is in the process of discharging the debt. Applicant\u2019s serious injury \nduring his last deployment in the military was also a reason for his failure to address his \nfinancial problems immediately upon learning about them. On the surface this appears \nto be a situation where Applicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and inaction for so long casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. However, a deeper \nanalysis shows that Applicant was not the individual who engaged in reckless spending \nand ignored the bills. In fact, when Applicant realized how indebted he was, he hired \nattorneys to help him. He filed Bankruptcy in June 2023, to discharge the debt. Under \nthe particular circumstances of this case, Applicant has done everything possible to \nresolve his indebtedness as soon as possible. Mitigating conditions (a) through (d) are \napplicable. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are being resolved. Overall, Applicant has shown that he is making progress \ntowards resolving his debts. He has filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and is currently \nwaiting for the court to discharge the debts. There is sufficient evidence in the record to \nshow that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \ngovernment security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts incurred by his two ex-wifes while he was deployed overseas in the military are \ncurrently listed in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition filed with the court in June 2023, \nawaiting discharge. Under the circumstances, this shows good judgement, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.k.  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

During that time, he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree and in September \n2013 started working in his current position. (AX A; GX 1.) \nFrom 2010 until 2015, Applicant attended a university from which he received all \nthree of his degrees. The university offered in-person and online classes. Applicant met \nwith a recruiter at the university who advised him that the payment of the student loans \nthat he was incurring would be an easy and affordable repayment process. At the time \nthat he borrowed the money to fund his higher education, and after completing his course \nof studies in 2015, Applicant did not have a firm understanding of the student-loan \nrepayment process. (AX A; GX 2; Tr.????) \nIt is relevant to note that the practices of the university Applicant attended have \nbeen challenged in multiple lawsuits to include several class actions. Recently, the \nuniversity was part of a class-action lawsuit that claimed the listed schools defrauded their \nstudents through misrepresentations and actions that constituted predatory lending \npractices. The class is comprised of students/former students with federal student loans \nused to attend any of the listed schools who filed or are eligible to file a borrower defense \napplication to oppose repayment of their student loans. The class-action settlement \nreceived final approval on November 16, 2022. https://studentaid.gov \nApproximately six months after graduation, Applicant received his first repayment \nnotice he was stunned by the approximately $1,400 monthly payment. This amount was \napproximately one half of his monthly income and was not affordable for him. He \ncontacted the Department of Education (DOE), which was the creditor of his loan, and \nattempted to work out an affordable repayment agreement. The DOD representative was \nstated that Applicant was required to pay the full monthly payment. Unable to do so, he \ndefaulted student-loan repayments. (AX A; GX 2; Tr.????) \nIn April 2017, DOE began garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages in the approximate amount \nof $260 to $285 every two weeks. DOE also seized Applicant\u2019s federal and state tax \nrefunds. Although he was frustrated by the fact that the total monthly payment through \nthe garnishment was affordable to him and something to which he would have agreed to \ngiven the opportunity, he was, nonetheless relieved that the loans were in repayment. \nInquiry into a loan with habilitation program the information he read stated that he needed \nto make eight consecutive payments to the loan, but he was unable to ascertain whether \nor not the garnishment payments would also continue, thus creating a scenario where he \nwas making a double monthly payment which was not something he was able to afford. \nThe garnishment remained in place until the March 13, 2020, COVID-19 payment pause. \nSee https://studentaid.gov Applicant\u2019s payments total between $16,000 and $17,000. (AX \nA; GX 2; GX 1.) The student-loan debts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, 1.n, and \n1.q. \nIn approximately 2018, in an effort to appease his fianc\u00e9e, Applicant began using \nhis credit cards more frequently for more extravagant entertainment and purchases than \nwas his general practice. At the time, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was contributing to the payments \non the credit cards.

The delinquent credit-card \naccounts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.r through 1.v. (GX 2; AX A.) \nIn May 2020, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e terminated their relationship and Applicant moved \nout. He rented a small two-bedroom apartment which he had to furnish in its entirety. His \nthen 16-year-old daughter moved in with him full time and his son, then 9, lived with him \nhalf of the time. Applicant was responsible for the increased living expenses necessarily \nincurred by his children, as well as school-related items such as clothing, backpacks, \nsupplies, etc. (AX A; Tr.????) \nIn spring 2020, Applicant began consulting with several friends, including his direct \nsupervisor, about managing personal finances, including strategies for paying off debt. \nBased on the advice he received, he structured a plan for resolving his debts. He realized \nthat he needed an overall better understanding of how credit worked, so he subscribed \nto a free credit- monitoring program through which he began to study how credit worked \nand closely monitor his credit. (AX A; Tr.???) \nIn approximately May 2020, in accordance with his plan, Applicant determined that \nhe needed to restructure his car-loan debts because he was paying very high interest on \nhis two car loans. He made two withdrawals from his 401(k), each withdrawal was for the \nexact amount of the payoff on each of the two car loans and paid the car loans off. He \nalso contacted DOE to make arrangements to enter a student-loan rehabilitation \nagreement. He then contacted all of the creditors of his delinquent accounts that he was \nable to identify from the list available through his credit-monitoring company. (AX A: \nTr.???) \nIn May 2022, Applicant received a letter from DOE stating that he had successively \nrehabilitated his student loans, that the loans were now in good standing, and that they \nhad been transferred to a loan servicer. The loan servicer consolidated Applicant\u2019s 13 \nloans into a single account with a monthly payment of $223. However, due to the payment \npause, Applicant\u2019s monthly payments are not scheduled to begin until August 31, 2023. \nIn accordance with his repayment agreement, the loan-servicer will annually review \nApplicant\u2019s salary to determine the amount of the monthly payments based on his income. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, 1.n, and 1.q, totaling $106,636, are in good standing. (AX B; AX \nC; AX D; Tr.???) \nIn September 2022, Applicant settled the $661 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.u. In December 20, he settled the $1,186 credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.s. (AX H; \nAX G.) He contacted the creditor of the credit-card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l ($3,263) \n1.m ($2,459), and 1.p ($1,639) and attempted to consolidate the three debts and make \none monthly payment, but the creditor would not permit this.

The accounts are \ncharged off and he stated that they have been sold to collection agencies that he has not \nbeen able to locate. Department Counsel suggested that Applicant use the contact \ninformation and the account numbers from the original creditors listed on the December \n2021 CBR to try to track down contact information for the collection agencies. Applicant \nagreed that this was an approach that he would try. (AX A; Tr.????) \nSince 2013, when he started working for his current employer, Applicant always \nreceived a state tax refund until tax year 2021. He did not alter his withholding status and \nwas surprised to learn that he owed approximately $1,800 in state taxes for 2021. He \nsatisfied the tax debt through a monthly-payment plan. (Tr.????) \nIn order to avoid owing state taxes for tax year 2022, Applicant used several online \ntax calculators to ensure that he was withholding the proper amount. Despite the \nconfirming information that he received from using the online calculators, Applicant owed \nstate taxes for 2022 in the amount of $1,300. He contacted the state treasurer to make \npayment arrangements prior to April 18, the due date, but was informed that he would \nhave to wait until after the due date for an official statement from the treasurer regarding \nthe amount that he owes. The treasurer stated that official notices will be sent out between \none week and one month after the due date. Once Applicant receives the official notice, \nhe will be able to make payment arrangements. He is awaiting the terms of the repayment \nbefore he obligates himself to repayment of his remaining credit-card debts. In order to \nprevent future state-tax liability, he is having an additional $60 a paycheck deducted for \nhis state taxes. (AX A; Tr.???) \nApplicant contributes $200 a month to his son\u2019s mother for his son\u2019s support as \nwell as providing for the purchase of necessary items such as clothing and school \nsupplies. Applicant drives approximately 180 miles per day to go to and from work. He \nretains ownership of his two older vehicles to ensure that at least one of them is \nmechanically sound enough to make the daily round trip. Because of the age of the \nvehicles and the high usage of them, he routinely has maintenance costs and recently \nspent approximately $500 for new tires on one of his vehicles. \nOn the advice she received in credit counseling, Applicant has been working to \nreestablish her credit. She has opened new credit-card accounts with six of the creditors \nof the SOR debts. She was advised to maintain small balances on several accounts long \nenough for the accounts to be reported, then pay the balance of the accounts. \nAdditionally, Applicant stated that there are several circumstances, such as travel and car \nrental, where a credit card is required.

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information\u2026. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

Specifically, coincident with \nreceiving a duplicate payment that was deducted from her pay for three months, \nApplicant\u2019s husband stopped making any financial contributions to the household. \nApplicant was unable to maintain her consumer credit-card payments on her retirement \nand disability pay. However, she maintained her mortgage-loan payments. Applicant and \nher husband separated in 2019. \nWhile attending college, Applicant met with a credit counselor on several \noccasions and learned techniques for addressing delinquent debt. In 2018, Applicant \nbegan contacting her creditors in an effort to pay her smaller accounts and enter \nrepayment plans with the larger accounts. She received seven 1099-Cs that she filed with \nher 2019 and 2020 federal tax returns.. \nApplicant has resolved each of the debts alleged in the SOR through either \ncancellation of debt or repayment. She provided documentation showing the repayment \nof five of the SOR debts. Through the cancellation of debt and the repayment of her \naccounts, Applicant has resolved $41,328 of delinquent debt, which is greater than 73% \nof the SOR debt. She has not recently been contacted by any of the creditors of the SOR \ndebts. She has re-established credit with six of the creditors of the SOR debts. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant, on the advice of the credit counselor, has used her credit cards to \ncontinue to work on re-establishing her credit.

He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n\u201cA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.

While those granted access to classified information are \nheld to a high standard of conduct, they are not held to a standard of perfection. \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant is financially reckless or \nirresponsible or that she is likely to disregard her financial obligations in the future. She \nestablished a plan to resolve her debts and has implemented that plan. She lives within \nher means, maintains a budget, and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. She \nmaintains a checking account, savings account, and a retirement account. She has a \npositive net monthly remainder. Applicant\u2019s past financial issues do not cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the Army for 24 years, including five deployments. \nShe demonstrated her dedication to continuing to serve as a civilian through her pursuit \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof a degree in logistics, the field in which she now works. She is financially stable and \nfiscally responsible. She was sincere and credible while testifying. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by her financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.v: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

It cross-alleged his \nmarijuana use in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nApplicant denied the falsification allegations because he believes he made a \nmistake and misinterpreted the question in assuming the other sections correlated. He \nclaimed he answered the question incorrectly by an honest mistake. He claims he was \nnot trying to hide anything or be deceptive, or lie. He has held a security clearance since \n2009. On his SCA, he answered \u201cNO.\u201d to have you ever illegally used or otherwise been \nillegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security \nclearance other than previously listed?

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

This is \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish that he used and purchased marijuana as alleged \nin the SOR for some years and while holding a security clearance. The record also \nestablishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after being employed with a Federal \ncontractor. Applicant\u2019s statement that he would continue to use it does not lend credibility \nto his one statement that he would abstain in the future. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after \nhe knew that his position with a federal contactor required him to refrain from using illegal \ndrugs shows a reckless disregard for rules and regulations. This is sufficient to raise AG \n\u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse, AG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding \u2026 purchase or sale; AG \u00b6 25(f) expressed intent to continue drug involvement \nand substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. The Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nraises security concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2021. He has \njust recently stated that he would abstain from marijuana use because it is a tangible \nthreat to his security clearance. He believes his open and honest response to his \ninvestigator should prove that he is trustworthy. He argued that although he has been a \ndrug user since college and after, because he is finally forthright, the Government should \nignore the former illegal marijuana use because he made a mistake by not putting it on \nhis security clearance application in response to Section 23 . This does not mitigate his \ncase. This conduct casts doubt about his judgment and reliability. I find that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose \nhis use of illegal drugs in his 2018 SCA SOR 2.a and cross alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd.

ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is a mature adult who has completed the adjudication process at least \ntwice during his career. He knew that the policy is against use of marijuana. His claim that \nhe just made a mistake or an error on his security clearance application is unsupported \nby corroborating evidence. I find that he intentionally falsified his applications and that he \ndid not report that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance. \nBased on all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nmaterial information in Section 24 of his 2008 SCA, by answering \u201cNO\u201d. He falsified his \ninformation in \u00b6 2.a. Thus, I also conclude for the reason listed above that the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(e) that his use of marijuana created a vulnerability as \ncontemplated by AG \u00b616(e), which applies to SOR 2.b.The following mitigating conditions \nare potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct the omission \nand stated he misinterpreted the question. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification is arguably infrequent, but it \nwas recent and did not happen under unique circumstances. It was not minor, because \nfalsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole Person \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, and E in my \nwhole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s career as an employee of defense \ncontractors. I have also considered that he held a security clearance \nsince 2009. Because he requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor or to question him about the allegations \nin the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines  H, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns under  Guideline H and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H :  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nNoreen A.

He said that he thought it was okay to smoke marijuana there because it was legal \nunder state law. After being informed that federal law and DOD policy prohibiting \nmarijuana use applied to security clearance holders even if marijuana use was permitted \nunder state law, Applicant said that he would not use marijuana again. He said that he \nhad smoked marijuana two to three times each visit over a period of about two weeks. He \nsaid that he would take one small inhalation of marijuana from an electronic cigarette and \nwould feel more relaxed. He would sometimes consume marijuana edibles before going \nto bed. He purchased edibles in November 2019 for about $30. He said that he ate one \nor two of the edibles and left the remaining edibles with his best friend and his best friend\u2019s \nspouse.

(Id.) After learning that he \nwas not permitted to use marijuana in his birth state, he did not consume anything \ncontaining marijuana, and told his friends that he was prohibited from using marijuana. \nHis friends \u201crespected it and not only didn\u2019t offer [him] any, but even went outside anytime \nthey wanted to use [marijuana].\u201d (Id.)

He attributed his financial problems to unanticipated expenses \nincluding replacement of home heating and air conditioning systems and a hot water \nheater, repair costs for flooding damage, fence repairs for damage caused by a fallen \ntree, and his pets\u2019 health issues. \nApplicant disclosed his financial difficulties and that he was working with a debt \nconsolidation company (DCC) in his 2020 SCA. He discussed specific details of each \ndebt and his debt resolution efforts during his background interview. He said that over a \nperiod of several years he had accrued delinquent debt because of unexpected \nexpenses. He was current on his debts but could only afford minimum payments on some \ndebts and continued to fall behind. \nIn about October 2019, he entered an agreement with a DCC to negotiate \nsettlements with some creditors and was told to stop making payments on those debts. \nBy March 2021, the DCC had resolved most delinquent debts with funds deposited \nmonthly ($584) by Applicant. In March 2021, he obtained a debt consolidation loan \n($24,413), and the DCC used the loan proceeds to resolve his remaining delinquent \ndebts. He has been current on all credit accounts since then and, as of May 26, 2023, \nhad reduced the debt consolidation loan balance to $12,363 by making required monthly \npayments. He said that he had made all required monthly payments on a home mortgage \nsince October 2016. Documentary evidence including credit reports from December \n2020, June 2022 and May 2023 corroborate Applicant\u2019s claims and testimony. These \ndebts are resolved.

His cohabitant, a Master Level Clinical Mental Health Counselor and \ncertified alcohol and drug counselor with six years of experience in addiction treatment, \noffered her personal but unofficial assessment that Applicant did not meet the criteria of \nsomeone suffering from any form of substance abuse or drug dependence, and that he \nhas not demonstrated symptoms of a substance misuse problem. (AE C-E) \nApplicant\u2019s regional service manager testified and authored documents that \ncommented favorably about his work performance, sobriety at work, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and compliance with rules and regulations regarding safeguarding \nclassified information.

(Tr. 28-39; AE G-H) \nAny derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes; however, it may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions, assessment of credibility, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any drug abuse; \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted and other record evidence corroborated that he illegally used \nmarijuana from November 2017 until about October 2020, that he purchased marijuana \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin about November 2019, and that he used and purchased marijuana while granted \naccess to classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are not fully established. Applicant used marijuana 10-12 \ntimes a year from about November 2017 to October 2020, while visiting a state where its \nuse was lawful under state law. I find his corroborated claims that he has not illegally used \ncontrolled substances since October 2020 credible and he provided a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from illegal drug use. However, he used marijuana several years after \ncompleting an SCA that reflected DOD concerns about illegal drug usage, with knowledge \nthat it\u2019s use was prohibited under federal law and DoD policy, and while he had a security \nclearance and was granted access to classified information. He first used marijuana \u201con \na whim\u201d with his best friend and he then used marijuana more than 40 more times over a \nfour-year period including smoking marijuana with his best friend one to three times each \nof those four years. He provided varying accounts of the number of times he used \nmarijuana and purchased marijuana edibles. He continues to associate with and stay with \nhis best friend and his best friend\u2019s spouse, who continue to use marijuana while he stays \nwith them, albeit apparently outside of his presence. This evidence is insufficient to \nconvince me that recurrence is unlikely. \n\u201cAn applicant who uses [controlled substances] after having been placed on notice \nof its security significance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, \nmay be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The record evidence \ndiscussed above including Applicant\u2019s admissions potentially support application of the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.

An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including\nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(d) are established for the debts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by circumstances partially or fully beyond his \ncontrol. He acted responsibly by prioritizing and paying some of his debts, enrolling the \nremaining debts in a payment plan, obtaining a debt consolidation loan, timely making all \nrequired payments, and resolving all delinquent accounts before the SOR was issued. He \nhas taken reasonable actions under his unique financial circumstances to address his \ndelinquent debts and has established a \u201cmeaningful track record of debt reduction.\u201d See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There are clear indications that \nhis financial problems are resolved and are under control. His debts were incurred under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely and his financial conduct does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.   \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, E, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s \nage and maturity, work record, security clearance history, character evidence, and that \nhe has not used marijuana since October 2020. I also considered his history of illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information and his continued association with \nfriends in an environment where marijuana is used, albeit outside of his immediate \npresence. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means \nthat the record discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

(Tr. 27; AE \nC) The balance on the line of credit alleged in subparagraph 1.h is $494, and the amount \npast due is allegedly $120. Applicant contacted a bank representative who looked up the \naccount and told him that he had a zero balance. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant has minimal monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 31-32) He intends to \nsatisfy his debt by \u201cslowly chipping away\u201d at it, satisfying one account in its entirety before \nmoving to another. (Tr. 33) In 2018, he consulted a financial counselor who rejected his \nrequest to work with him. Applicant has not attempted to retain a financial counselor since \nthen. (Tr. 29) Shortly before the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife took a job. Previously she was \na stay-at-home mother. (Tr.21) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is still in the process of resolving his delinquent debts, and the majority \nremains outstanding. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant readily admits that his financial problems were caused by irresponsible \nmoney management. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nApplicant has not retained a financial counselor. Nevertheless, he has satisfied the \ndebt alleged in subparagraphs 1.e, 1.f and 1.h, entirely, and arranged payment plans to \nsatisfy the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b. Given his efforts to resolve or \narrange for the resolution of these debts, I am confident that he will resolve the remaining \nunpaid SOR debts, as promised, once he finishes satisfying the ones that he currently \nhas arranged to pay. Under these circumstances, both the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(c), \n\u201c. . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply. In sum, I conclude that Applicant \nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of reckless overspending. As such, \nthe nature and seriousness of the problem was significant. Conversely, Applicant was \nadmittedly young and immature when he made these bad spending decisions. His \nrecognition of his financial problem, the steps taken to address the problem, and the \nprogress he has made thus far, lead me to conclude that he has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She considered filing for bankruptcy but could not afford \nthe filing fee. With the decreased salary and loss of child support, she was unable to \nmake minimum monthly payments on many of her accounts. She used her tax refunds to \nrepay loans from her parents.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the Court Case Summaries, and the Government\u2019s credit reports \nshow that AG \u00b6\u00b619(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a)  \nthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b)  \nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) \nthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors.     \nThe question is whether any mitigating conditions apply on these facts. Many of \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts became delinquent in 2016, 2017, or later. That is not very long \nago. Nor were those SOR debts infrequent. And they persist to the present. Because of \nthe frequency and recency of the debts, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate her debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) requires a two-step analysis. First, the conditions \nthat caused Applicant\u2019s \u201cfinancial problem\u201d must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d her control. \nIn 2012 or 2013, her employer moved her to a different contract. As a result, her annual \npay was reduced by 30%. That alone would have had an unexpected and significant \nnegative impact on her finances. In 2014, she had surgery that resulted in expenses not \nfully covered by her insurance. No doubt that too aggravated her financial problems. And \nin 2015, she gave birth to her first child. Those circumstances were without question \nbeyond her control, and individually even one of those circumstances could have \nadversely affected her financial condition. To make matters worse, in 2021 the father of \nher child stopped paying his $1,000 of child support. The first question under AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis answered in her favor. \nThat brings up the second question under AG \u00b6 20(b). Did Applicant act \nresponsibly when facing that array of adverse circumstances? At the outset, she and her \nchild began living with her parents. She used her tax refunds to repay loans she had taken \nfrom her parents. She considered filing for bankruptcy but lacked the funds to pay the \nfiling fee. Instead, she enrolled ten of her largest debts in a debt relief agency. She pays \n$729 per month to that agency towards paying off those debts, all of which are listed in \nthe SOR. And she obtained a court order directing the father of her child to resume paying \nhis $1,000 per month child support. Not only is the foregoing conduct responsible under \nAG \u00b6 20(b), it also satisfies mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d). She has initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay her overdue creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d). Moreover, the \nunresolved SOR debts of $8,428 are not of a sufficient value to raise national security \nconcerns. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. More specifically, Applicant \nproduced documents showing that she was current with her utilities, phone, and Internet \nbills. Those were not alleged in the SOR. Conduct not alleged in a SOR may be \nconsidered for limited purposes, one of which is to assess mitigating circumstances. See \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant volunteered that \ninformation, and it works in her favor.   \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about her eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n     \n \n \n         \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.t.:  \n  FOR APPLICANT \n For Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to be eligible for access to classified \ninformation.

His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review of the \npleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of \nfact: \nApplicant is 40 years old. He has never been married and has no children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. Since 2021 he has worked overseas as a civil \nengineer and functional manager for a government contractor. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1) \nApplicant was born in Iraq and lived there until he was about 30 years old. After \ncompleting college in Iraq in 2005, he worked for an Iraqi company in the construction \nindustry. In 2008, he started working for a construction company that serviced coalition \nmilitary bases in Iraq. In 2010, he was threatened twice by unknown persons for working \non coalition bases, and had to take safety precautions. In 2012, he was granted a special \nimmigrant visa (SIV) for his work on coalition bases, and he immigrated to the United \nStates. He was granted U.S. citizenship in 2019.

(Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant does not own a home or have a lease for a rental property in the United \nStates. He asserted that he thinks of U.S. State A as home and has a driver\u2019s license \nfrom there. The license lists the address of a friend from whom Applicant claims to rent a \nroom on occasion, when visiting the United States. However, in his testimony at the \nhearing, Applicant did not know the last name of this friend. Applicant does not have many \npersons in the United States with whom he maintains close and continuing contact. He \nhas a U.S. bank account and a 401K retirement account, neither of which contains more \nthan $20,000. (Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and six siblings, and their immediate families, are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq. Four siblings have jobs that are connected to the Iraqi government. In \nhis SCA, Applicant reported regular and frequent contact with almost all of these \nimmediate family members.

(Tr. 15-58; Answer) \nIn his answer, Applicant included four character letters which state that he is a \nvalued employee, reliable, trustworthy, and fit to hold a security clearance. (Answer) \nIraq \nIn AN 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of September 2022, about the United States\u2019 relations with Iraq and the current \nconditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts:  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, \u201cLevel 4: \nDo not travel\u201d location due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and limited \nability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence \nand kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces \nand civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies \nthroughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas \nof the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. \nThese events can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, \ntransportation, and other services; such events have the potential to turn violent. The \ntravel warning as of the date of this decision remains the same. \nThe country experienced large-scale protests in Baghdad and several Shia\u00ad\nmajority provinces beginning in 2019 and lasting through mid-2020, with reports of more \nthan 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. During the year sporadic protests \ncontinued amid a campaign of targeted violence against activists. The government took \nminimal steps to bring to justice those responsible for the violence. \nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking \nU.S. citizens abroad. Primary terrorist threats within Iraq included Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria (ISIS) and Iran-aligned militia groups. ISIS is a designated terrorist \norganization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border. ISIS and its associated \nterrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite \nimproved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. \ncitizens for attacks and hostage-taking.  \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, including: credible reports \nof unlawful or arbitrary killings; extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances by the \ngovernment; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the government; \nand arbitrary arrest and detention. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and foreign contacts are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nA heightened security risk in Iraq is established by the administratively noticed \nfacts in the record. The security risks include the risk of terrorism and the human-rights \nrecords of this country. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and six siblings, with whom he maintains close and continuing \ncontact, are citizens and residents of Iraq, and four siblings have jobs that are connected \nto the Iraqi government. Applicant\u2019s longstanding connection to Iraq presents a conflict of \ninterest.

The record evidence demonstrates \nthat the home is owned by his mother, and that his sister stands to inherit it. SOR \u00b6 1.h is \ntherefore found for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and   \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant has several immediate family members remaining in Iraq, with whom he \nmaintains close and frequent contact. Iraq remains a heightened risk country. Applicant \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that there is no conflict of \ninterest between his sense of loyalty or obligation to his foreign contacts, his allegiance \nand connection to Iraq is minimal, and that he has deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S. that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in the \nfavor of the U.S. interest. Even though Applicant earned a SIV to come to United States, \nhe has longstanding personal and familial connections to Iraq. He spent three quarters of \nhis life in Iraq, and after immigrating to the United States, he has spent a significant \namount of time living and working overseas, including in Iraq. Further, his ties to the U.S. \nare comparatively limited. He owns no real property here. He recalled few details about \nhis connections to the U.S. On balance, he did not provide sufficient evidence that AG \u00b6 \n8(b) should apply to mitigate the security concerns established by his family members in \nIraq. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that his contact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. In his SCA, he reported \nmaintaining frequent contact with most of his family members, and he continues to have \na close bond of affection and obligation for them. His temporary limitation of \ncommunications with his family members during the processing of his security clearance \ndoes not alleviate these concerns. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline B arising from his foreign contacts and \nconnections to Iraq. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

I granted the motion without objection \nand amended the SOR accordingly. (Tr. 8-9) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2022 SOR response, she admitted all of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u00ad\n1.k.) and provided some clarification if the specific debt was considered a joint debt, or \nan account owned by her ex-husband. The SOR alleges 11 delinquent accounts with a \ncombined total of $134,323. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old, and she has been employed by different federal \ncontractors since June 2009.

(Tr. 27-28, 59; GE 1; AE A) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant testified that beginning in 2015, she and her spouse began to experience \nfinancial problems. At that time, her first husband was unemployed and a severe \nalcoholic. When he was employed, his salary was substantially higher than her annual \nincome of about $60,000.

(Tr. 27-31, 35, 60-\n61) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a student loan referred for collection in the amount of $113,181. \nApplicant admitted that about 63% of this debt belongs to her, which would amount to \napproximately $68,000, and the remainder belongs to her ex-husband. In about 2005, \nthey consolidated their student loans which, at that time, totaled approximately $87,617. \nSince voluntary payments were not being sent to the creditor, the creditor garnished her \nwages. She provided a December 2019 pay stub that showed her 2019 wages had been \ninvoluntarily garnished in the total amount of about $5,498 for the year. An April 2020 pay \nstub reflected her wages were garnished in the total amount of $3,550 for the year, for a \ncombined total of $9,048. Thereafter the garnishment stopped, presumably due to \nPresident Biden\u2019s March 2020 order for an emergency pause on the payment of student \nloans. Under the CARES Act, Federal student loan payments remain paused until at least \nJune 30, 2023. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19 (Tr. 32-41; \nGE 2, GE 7; AE C) \nApplicant stated in response to interrogatories dated November 2021, that as soon \nas the federal pause on student loans is lifted, she will begin making payments. The \noutstanding student loan balance is $113,181. She did not provide supporting \ndocumentation to show that 63% of the student loan debt is her responsibility, or that she \nhad voluntarily made payments on her delinquent student loans before the CARES Act \nwas passed. (Tr. 32-41; GE 2, GE 7; AE C) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f allege five collection accounts with the same \ncreditor totaling $1,322. Applicant stated in her July 2022 SOR response that a payment \nplan was established with this creditor. Monthly payments of $100 would start on July 25, \n2022, through August 2023 to pay these accounts in full. On March 9, 2023, she provided \ndocumentation which showed the payment plan is in process with an outstanding balance \nof $522. These accounts are being resolved. (SOR response; Tr. 41-42; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a delinquent account with a retail store that was charged-off as \na bad debt in the amount of $1,947. Applicant stated in her July 2022 SOR response that \na payment plan was established with this creditor. Monthly payments of $25 would start \non July 25, 2022 and continue until the account was paid in full. During the hearing she \nstated she would submit supporting documentation while the record was held open. She \ntimely submitted information that showed the account payment plan was not in effect. The \npayments had stopped in 2022 due to incorrect bank information. The balance of the \naccount is $1,848. Applicant stated in an email that she requested monthly statements \nbe sent to her so she can start to make payments again. She did not provide supporting \ndocumentation. This account has not been resolved.

(AE B, AE G) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

An individual who is financially\noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise\nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, as shown by her admissions \nand by credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nApplicant has a long history of incurring delinquent debts. One of her debts has \nbeen paid, and some others are being resolved through a payment agreement. However, \nthe bulk of Applicant\u2019s debts are unresolved, including her delinquent student loans. She \nhas not made an effort to address them, and payments made through an involuntary wage \ngarnishment does not receive full mitigation, such as a good-faith effort of initiating a \npayment plan with the creditor. Her student loans were delinquent long before the CARES \nAct was enacted in March 2020. She testified that she does not really have a monthly \nbudget in place, and she had not completed financial counseling. She has not established \nthat her financial behavior is unlikely to recur or no longer casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. \nThere were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control which contributed to her financial \nproblems. Her spouse\u2019s unemployment, her underemployment, and a contentious \ndivorce. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nshe must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances. Her PFS \nexecuted in November 2021 reflected that after paying her monthly expenses, she had a \nnet monthly remainder of about $2,700. The PFS did not show that she was making a \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ngood-faith effort to repay her delinquent creditors. She stated that she withheld paying \nher delinquent creditors because she was waiting for her divorce to be finalized. Her \ndivorced had already been finalized for six months at the time she filled out her PFS. \nIt is clear after reading Applicant\u2019s SOR response that she initiated two payment \nplans with creditors only after she received the SOR in July 2022. One of the payment \nplans was not executed, however, due to incorrect bank information. I find Applicant has \nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances. She did not provide a reasonable \nexplanation as to why she was unable to make better progress addressing her delinquent \naccounts when she had the financial resources at her disposal. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) \ndo not apply. Under all of these circumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 54 years old, and she is highly regarded as a committed and \nresponsible employee at her place of employment. I observed her demeanor during the \nhearing. There is no question in my mind that she is an exceptional employee providing \noutstanding service. \nApplicant did not establish why she was unable to make better progress in \nresolving her delinquent creditors. This is especially so after the review of her November \n2021 PFS showed she had a net monthly remainder of about $2,700, without any \npayments going to her delinquent creditors. She did not initiate good-faith payments plans \nwith some of her creditors until after she received the SOR in July 2022. Her actions \ndemonstrate a lack of fiscal responsibility and good judgment, and raise unmitigated \nquestions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of her past-due debt, she may well be \nable to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude \nthat financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.f, 1.i, and 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He has a two-year-old son, and he and his wife are expecting another child. (Tr. 21-22; GE 1-4; AE A-C, E) From about September 2011 until March 2014, Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency in social settings while he attended college. In April 2017, in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2017 SF 86), he claimed that he had no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. He reaffirmed his intention to no longer use marijuana or other illegal drugs during his 2018 security interview. Notwithstanding his prior marijuana involvement, the DOD granted him access to classified information in about November 2018. Despite his stated intention to avoid illegal drug involvement, he used marijuana in January 2019, May 2019, and March 2021, while he was granted access to classified information.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked \nfor his current employer since February 2016. He earned a high school diploma in 2010 \nand a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2015. He has been married since December \n2015. He has a two-year-old son, and he and his wife are expecting another child. (Tr. \n21-22; GE 1-4; AE A-C, E) \nFrom about September 2011 until March 2014, Applicant purchased and used \nmarijuana with varying frequency in social settings while he attended college. In April \n2017, in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2017 SF 86), he claimed that \nhe had no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. He reaffirmed his intention to no \nlonger use marijuana or other illegal drugs during his 2018 security interview. \nNotwithstanding his prior marijuana involvement, the DOD granted him access to \nclassified information in about November 2018. Despite his stated intention to avoid \nillegal drug involvement, he used marijuana in January 2019, May 2019, and March \n2021, while he was granted access to classified information. He used marijuana these \nthree times socially with friends He also purchased marijuana on at least one of these \noccasions. In his June 2021 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2021 SF 86), \nhe stated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, but that he might use it \nbecause he thought marijuana use should be legalized. He reiterated this sentiment \nduring his June 2021 security interview, telling the DOD investigator that marijuana \nshould be legal under federal law, and implying that he knew best about whether he \ncould use it. He also acknowledged that he was violating his employer\u2019s drug use policy \nwhen he used marijuana. He last used marijuana in March 2021. He has not used or \npurchased any other illegal drugs. (Tr. 20-21, 25-33, 37-39; Answer; GE 1-4, AE A-C) \nApplicant now claims that he is no longer open to using marijuana. He claimed \nthat he has matured since he last used marijuana and last opined that he would be \nopen to using it. He claimed that he is now ashamed of the statements he made \nregarding marijuana use in his 2021 SF 86 and during his June 2021 security interview. \nHe credits the birth of his son and his overall maturation process with changing his \nperspective. He claimed that having a child, with another on the way, has led him to put \nhis family first, and to look out for their best interests, instead of his own. He also \nclaimed that he now understands that he must abide by the federal prohibition against \nmarijuana use regardless of whether he agrees with it. He volunteered his illegal drug \nuse in his 2017 SF 86 and his 2021 SF 86 and discussed it openly with the investigators \nduring his security interviews in August 2018 and June 2021. (Tr. 20-22, 33-37; Answer; \nGE 1-4; AE A-C, H) \nApplicant continues to associate with some of the individuals with whom he used \nmarijuana in the past, but they have not used it in his presence since March 2021. He is \nunaware of whether they continue to use marijuana. His wife does not use marijuana \nand there is no marijuana in his house.

I \nobserved him while he testified and found him to be sincere and credible. His reporting \nof derogatory information regarding his illegal drug use, including, paradoxically, his \nearlier openness to continuing to use marijuana in the future, bolsters his credibility. (Tr. \n20-23, 33-39; Answer; GE 1-4; AE A-C, H) \nIn July 2022 and in February 2023, Applicant underwent hair-follicle drug tests for \nvarious controlled substances, including marijuana. He tested negative on both tests. \nHe provided character-reference letters from his wife and his supervisor. His wife wrote \nthat he is hard working, loyal, and responsible. She noted a change in his maturity level \nfor the better after the birth of their son. His supervisor wrote that he is a top performer \nwith good values. She considers him to be trustworthy and professional. (Tr. 22-23, 35, \n39-40; Answer; AE D-G) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s intermittent marijuana use and \npurchase from September 2011 until March 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), his intermittent use and \npurchase of marijuana after being granted access to classified information in November \n2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and his stated intention to continue to use marijuana in the future in \nhis 2021 SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAny adverse information not alleged in the SOR cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application of \nmitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant illegally used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout 2011 until about 2021. He also illegally used and purchased marijuana while he \nhad been granted access to classified information. In his 2021 SF 86, he stated that he \nwas open to using marijuana in the future. All the above-listed disqualifying conditions \nare applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has not used or purchased illegal drugs for more than two years. While \nhis illegal drug use and purchase in 2019 and 2021 was exacerbated by his holding a \nsecurity clearance, I do not believe his drug misuse is likely to recur. I base my opinion \non his two years of abstinence and his credible testimony that he will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future. His candor in divulging derogatory information throughout the \nclearance process and his changed circumstances in starting a family fortify my opinion \nthat he will not use or purchase illegal drugs again. AG \u00b6 26(a) fully applies. While he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstill associates with the individuals with whom he previously used marijuana, there is no \nevidence that those associates continue to use it. He provided the signed statement of \nintent to abstain contemplated in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). However, AG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially \napplicable because there is no evidence that he has changed or avoided the \nenvironment where drugs were used. Regardless, as I have found AG \u00b6 26(a) to be fully \napplicable and AG \u00b6 26(b) to be partially applicable, I find that the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character-reference letters, his credible testimony, and his \nconsistent open and honest reporting of derogatory information. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the Guideline H security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 35 years old and divorced with two children. She has a high school diploma. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2020. (Item 2 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Applicant Exhibit A.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant admitted all the allegations under this guideline with explanations. 1.a. Applicant and her husband filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code in 2013. They had approximately $89,235 in unsecured debt, along with secured debt in the amount of $91,263. Their unsecured debts were discharged in June 2014. (Item 4.) The SOR alleged that Applicant has 16 debts that were charged-off, or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $38,709. (SOR 1.b through 1.q.) The existence and amount of these debts is supported by her admissions to all SOR allegations in her Answer. The debts are also confirmed by credit reports submitted by the Government and Applicant dated June 30, 2020; August 18, 2021; and May 9, 2022. (Items 5, and 6; Attachment to Answer.)

She requested her case be decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. (Item 1.) On June 10, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the Department\u2019s \nwritten case. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items \n1 to 6, was provided to Applicant, who received the file on June 20, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant submitted additional \ninformation in a timely fashion. The information consisted of an undated statement from \nApplicant (Statement) and one exhibit (Applicant\u2019s Divorce decree dated January 12, \n2022). Department Counsel had no objection to the admission of the exhibit, and it is \nadmitted into evidence as Applicant Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me on August \n9, 2022. Items 1 through 6 are hereby entered into evidence. Based upon a review of the \npleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 35 years old and divorced with two children. She has a high school \ndiploma. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since January 2020. (Item \n2 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Applicant Exhibit A.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause she is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant \nadmitted all the allegations under this guideline with explanations. \n1.a. \nApplicant and her husband filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy \nCode in 2013. They had approximately $89,235 in unsecured debt, along with secured \ndebt in the amount of $91,263. Their unsecured debts were discharged in June 2014. \n(Item 4.) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has 16 debts that were charged-off, or in \ncollection, in the total amount of approximately $38,709. (SOR 1.b through 1.q.) The \nexistence and amount of these debts is supported by her admissions to all SOR \nallegations in her Answer. The debts are also confirmed by credit reports submitted by \nthe Government and Applicant dated June 30, 2020; August 18, 2021; and May 9, 2022. \n(Items 5, and 6; Attachment to Answer.) The existence of the debts is also supported by \nApplicant\u2019s answers on Section 26 of her e-QIP (Item 2) and during an interview with an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management on July 21, 2020.

He had a prescription drug problem and also drank to excess. They \nboth suffered from periods of unemployment or underemployment for several years. \nApplicant indicated in her Answer and Statement that most of the delinquent debt would \nfall off of her credit report due to age. She also stated in her Answer and Statement that \nshe is now financially stable but did not indicate an ability or desire to pay any of her past-\ndue debts. \nThe status of the debts is as follows: \n1.b. Applicant admitted that she is indebted to a wireless telephone company in \nthe amount of $2,239.

In her Answer to the SOR Applicant stated that this debt \nwas related to medical care obtained for her son in approximately 2015 that she thought \nwould be covered by insurance. She further stated that the debt is not listed on her most \nrecent credit report. (Attachment to Answer.) Applicant did not indicate that she had paid \nor made arrangements to pay this debt.

The most recent credit report continues to \nshow this as a past-due debt. (Attachment to Answer.) In her Answer to the SOR \nApplicant stated that she has been working with this particular collection agency to rebuild \nher credit, but did not specify how that was happening. Applicant did not indicate in her \nAnswer that she had paid or made arrangements to pay this debt. It is not resolved. \n1.e. Applicant admitted that she is indebted to a creditor for a past-due debt in the \namount of $696. In her Answer to the SOR Applicant stated, \u201cI have tried to dispute this \non my credit report because I\u2019m not sure what it was for but it was denied. I think it has \nswitched creditors and the original creditor is not listed on my credit report.\u201d The most \nrecent credit report shows the dispute and that it was resolved against Applicant. \n(Attachment to Answer.)

I am unable to make a \ncredibility assessment as Applicant elected not to have a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred over $38,000 in past-due indebtedness over the past \nseveral years, following the discharge of $89,235 in previous consumer debt through her \n2013 bankruptcy. She has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR, nor does she \nhave any current plans to do so. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant.

She indicated in her e-QIP a desire to repay these debts. However, her \nAnswer indicated that she was waiting for these debts to fall off her credit report. Applicant \nis under the mistaken impression that the fact a debt is old means it no longer exists. In \nsecurity clearance cases such as this that explanation for non-payment is not one that \nshows good judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness on Applicant\u2019s part. There is no basis \nin the record evidence for me to find that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \narising from her financial situation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over her considerable past-due indebtedness. The significant potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the record evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old. He completed high school and then earned an associate \ndegree in 2016. He married in 2008 and has two children ages 11 and 12. He has a third \nchild from another relationship. The age of the child is unknown. Applicant served in the \nmilitary from 2007 until 2014. He received a discharge under other than honorable \nconditions. Applicant had two periods of unemployment. After his discharge he was \nunemployed for two months in 2014 and again from April 2017 to June 2017. He has \nworked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since May 2018. \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $45,722. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR, background interview, responses to government \ninterrogatories, and credit reports from November 2018, January 2021, September 2021, \nand February 2022, corroborate the SOR allegations. (GE 1-8) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2018. In it \nhe disclosed he had delinquent debts and stated he called some debt collectors that \nappeared on his credit report to try and make payment arrangements and determine the \nbalance he owed. He then explained he fell on hard times and could not make payments \non his largest debt that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. His interrogatory response to his largest \ndebt was that it was not paid and no efforts had been made to make payment \narrangements. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant also explained that he had fathered a child while he was separated from \nhis wife and in the military. Two years later the mother of the child petitioned for child \nsupport. He explained he had been sending packages to the child every other month but \nthe court did not recognize this as child support but rather were gifts. SOR \u00b6 1.d ($4,884) \nis the amount alleged in arrears. His February 2022 credit report shows a balance of \n$3,067. Applicant did not respond to questions in his interrogatories about the status of \nhis delinquent child support or provide any current documentation to support he has made \nsubsequent efforts to pay the arrearages. (Items 2-8) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s February 2019 background investigation interview, he \nacknowledged almost all of the debts. He explained he was in the process of resolving \nthem. He said he was working with a credit repair company to help resolve his delinquent \ndebts. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant provided documents that he resolved \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q.

In response to government interrogatories, Applicant stated that he attributed \nhis financial issues to being young, in the military, and he was unable to pay the debts \nand let them lapse. He is now working and has paid some debts. He did not provide any \nother evidence or documents that he has resolved any of the remaining debts in the SOR, \nhas payment plans, contacted any of the creditors, or disputed any debts. (GE 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had 17 delinquent debts that he has been aware of since at least 2018 \nthat he was unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to that debt. He had \ntwo short periods of unemployment after his military discharge and was underemployed \nfor a period. These conditions were beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has been \nworking steadily for a federal contractor since May 2018. He did not provide evidence of \nany payments he may have made towards his remaining 16 debts that total more than \n$45,000. He stated he signed up for help from a credit repair company but did not provide \nany evidence of action taken to resolve any of the debts. No evidence was provided that \nsupports he has a payment plan with the any of the creditors, or that he has taken any \nother responsible action to resolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication .AG \u00b6 20(c) also has minimal application because he has not offered any proof \nof financial counseling, and there are not clear indications that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved or under control. No other mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph     1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 7.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor since August 20, 2020. (AppX I.) \nApplicant is married, but separated from his current spouse, and has two children. (GX \n1 at pages 18~19, and 22~23.) He served in the Marine Corps as an enlisted member, \nand was honorably discharged. (TR at page 15 lines 9~20.) \nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology, Guideline D - Sexual Behavior &\nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n1.a., 2.a. and 3.a. Applicant admits that beginning in at least January 2018, he \nused his Government-Issued computer to store and view images containing sexually \nexplicit, sexually orientated, and/or inappropriate content. (TR at page 17 line 12 to \npage 23 line 17.) As a result of this, on June 3, 2019, Applicant was suspended from \nduty and pay for 14 days, for Misuse of a Government Computer. (TR at page 34 line 8 \nto page 35 line 2.) He was further advised that any further misconduct may result in a \nmore severe disciplinary action. (GX 3.) \n1.b., 2.a. and 3.a. Applicant admits that from July 2019 to at least April 2020, he \nagain used his Government computer to store and view images containing sexually \nexplicit, sexually orientated, and/or inappropriate content. (TR at page 24 line 16 to \npage 31 line 6.) As a result of this misconduct, on June 16, 2020, Applicant was \nterminated from his place of employment, and thereby removed from Federal service. \n(GXs 6~9.) \nMost recently, in September of 2022, a Doctor of Psychology determined \nApplicant to be suffering from \u201ccompulsive behavior,\u201d but not from a \u201ccompulsive \ndisorder.\u201d She also averred, in part, the following: \u201cI feel his lapse in judgment was the \nproduct of severe and atypical psychosocial stressors the specific nature of which he is \nunlikely to again experience.\u201d The Doctor further averred: \u201cthe preponderance of the \nevidence in this case suggests that . . . [Applicant] is a reliable, ethical, and trustworthy \nemployee.\u201d (AppX M.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nis set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology [IT] systems may raise security \nconcerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into \nquestion the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, \nnetworks, and information. Information Technology includes any \ncomputer-based, mobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, \nprocess, manipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any \ncomponent, whether integrated into a larger system or not, such as \nhardware, software, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these \noperations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 40. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \nApplicant, despite being previously suspended for such conduct, he continued to \ndownload unauthorized pornography on his Government computer. \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \nd) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nNone of these apply. Despite a repeated warning; and a suspension, Applicant \ncontinued his unauthorized IT misconduct. Use of Information Technology is found \nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior\nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant received sexual gratification from downloading pornography on to a \nGovernment computer on numerous occasions until at least April of 2020. His conduct \nrepresents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThere is clear evidence from a Doctor of Psychology that future instances of this \nnature are unlikely to occur. (AppX M.) Sexual Behavior is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant continued to misuse his Government computer after being suspended \nand advised that any such future misconduct could result in severe disciplinary action. \nAs a result, he was removed from Federal service. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNone of these apply. In light of Applicant\u2019s fairly recent 2020 removal from \nFederal serve as the result of his repeated failure to comply with rules and regulations, \nPersonal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines M, D, and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nInformation Technology and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial consideration concerns.

The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec.

This case \nwas assigned to me on December 20, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for May 25, 2023 \nvia Microsoft Teams teleconference services, and was heard on the scheduled date. At \nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of three exhibits. (GEs 1-3) Applicant \nrelied on one witness (himself) and two exhibits (AEs A-B). The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on June 5, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with character references. For good \ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven calendar days to supplement the record with \na written budget. Department Counsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the \ntime permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with character references and a brief \nbudget. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted as AEs C-D. \nPrior to closing the record, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to \nchange the reported amount owing to SOR creditor \u00b6 1.c from $16,309 to $10,455 to \nconform to the evidence. The motion was granted without objection. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated two delinquent \nstudent loan debts exceeding $36,000 and five delinquent consumer and medical debts \nexceeding $24,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved and remain \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged SOR debts that \nwere either charged off or in collection and added explanations and clarifications. He \nclaimed he had worked with a debt consolidation service that did nothing for him but \nallow his debts to become delinquent. He claimed he was involved in an accident where \nhe was fault free but was unable to obtain reimbursement of his medical bills from the \nother driver\u2019s insurance carrier. He claimed that he either has or will be making payment \narrangements with his other listed creditors. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE 1; Tr. 38) He held part-time positions between January \n2007 and January 2012. (GE 1) Applicant has held a security clearance since May \n2010. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nApplicant financed his college education with the aid of a federally-guaranteed \nstudent loan in 1993 for approximately $17,000. (GEs 2-3; Tr;. 41, 63-64) By 2009, he \nhad paid down his student loan to around $9,000. (Tr. 41) As the result of either \nrefinancing or added interest, the account was reported in May 2022 to have a high \nbalance of $13,657 and a delinquent balance of $10,455. (GE 3) Applicant has not \nmade any additional payments on his personal education loan since November 2019, \nand the account remains in collection status with interest continuing to accrue. (GEs 2-\n3; Tr, 63-64) \nCredit reports confirm that in August 2017 Applicant took out a 36-month parent \nstudent loan for his son\u2019s college education in the amount $17,760. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 56-56, \n63-64) He took out this parent loan in his own name without any co-signature from his \nson. Since 2017, he has not made any payments on this parent loan, and credit reports \nconfirm that the account is in collection status with $20,627 owing on the cumulative \nbalance as of May 2022. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 42) \nCurrently, both of Applicant\u2019s student loans are in pause status. (Tr. 58-59) And, \nwhile the loans have been in pause status, Applicant has been exempt from making \npayments on either loan. (Tr. 58-59), However, the pause does not change the \ndelinquent condition of the loans, but only suspends any payment enforcement while \nthe pause remains in effect. And, despite promises to do so, Applicant has not provided \nany documentation of a payment plan or budget as to how he will rehabilitate his loans \nonce the pause is lifted. (Tr. 45) \nBesides his student loan debts, Applicant is indebted to five consumer creditors \nfor delinquent accounts exceeding $24,000. (GEs 2-3) He accrued these debt \ndelinquencies between 2013 and 2018. (GEs 2-3) Applicant attributed his debt \ndelinquencies to recurrent medical bills associated with a serious car accident he \nexperienced in 2015. (Tr. 42-43) \nEstimated medical expenses associated with his accident exceeded $100,000.\n(Tr. 44) Most of the bills (70 to 80 per cent) were covered by his medical insurance. (Tr. \n44) Applicant\u2019s incurred hospital co-pays and other medical bills he accrued to address \nhis injuries from he accident exceeded $22,000. (AE F; Tr. 42-44) \n \nIn 2018, Applicant retained a debt consolidation agency for about a year to help \nhim resolve his debts, (Tr. 48) Making no discernible progress with this agency, he \nterminated their services and withdrew his escrowed funds of approximately $5,000. (Tr. \n48-49) With the returned funds, he paid off some small medical bills.

Broken down, Applicant nets around \n$8,000 monthly in take home pay. (Tr. 38-39 49-51) His monthly expenses generally run \nclose to $5,000 (inclusive of medical expenses). (Tr. 51-52) His 401(k) retirement fund \ncurrently has about $100 in the account. (Tr. 40) Because his wife does not work, he \nhas only his own financial resources to cover his bills and other expenses. (Tr. 40) \nAfter accounting for his monthly expenses (inclusive of his medical co-pays that \nrun between $200 and $300 for himself and $200 for his wife), Applicant retains a \nmonthly remainder of close to $3,000. (AE F; Tr. 40, 53-55) Committing to taking care of \nhis bills, he documented a very limited payment plan and budget to support his ability to \ndo so.

(AE D; Tr. 20-21, \nand 29-36) They credit Applicant with being dependable, responsible, and trustworthy. \nAware of his financial issues, his team lead cited the advice she gave him on \naddressing his medical bills and how to rectify his financial situation. (AE D; Tr. 21) \nWhile unfamiliar with all of Applicant\u2019s debts, she knew most of the details of his medical \nbills and how they affected his ability to address his other debts.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence.

AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of seven \ndelinquent debts (inclusive of two delinquent student loans, four consumer accounts, \nand one medical debt) exceeding $60,000 in the aggregate. These collective debt \ndelinquencies warrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial considerations guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \n\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to the specific facts of \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts with explanations require no independent \nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \n\u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies is critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited explanations for his debt delinquencies (primarily due to \nprioritized medical debts) are insufficient to warrant the application of any of the \npotentially available mitigating conditions. Enforcement suspension of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent student loan debts (by far his largest delinquent accounts) does not mitigate \nthe pre-suspension delinquent status of his loans, and he made no documented efforts \nto rehabilitate his loans before the enforcement pause went into effect in 2020. \nCurrently, Applicant has no well-developed financial plan or refined budget in \nplace to aid him in mitigating the Government\u2019s financial concerns over his delinquent \nstudent loans. And, with the exception of the consumer debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f \n(which he has resolved), he has made no concerted efforts to resolve any of his \ndelinquent consumer and medical debts with the ample resources available to him over \nthe past three years. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and \nhis explanations as to why he has not been able to address his delinquent student loan \nand other debts to date, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable him to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n                                         \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nmaintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding a \nsecurity clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

While on administrative leave, he stated that he was brought into the \ncaptain\u2019s office due to an investigation into the soldier\u2019s claims, and he provided a \nwritten statement in response to her allegations.

An April 2020 email from his then-\nemployer\u2019s human resources director states: \n \n \n[Applicant] was accused of sexual harassment towards a soldier. A formal \ninvestigation was performed by the government, and the findings were \nthat [Applicant\u2019s] actions were in violation of Army Regulation 600-20, \nArmy Command Policy, para. 7-5 and Army Sexual Harassment/Assault \nResponse and Prevention (SHARP) Policy. It was also concerning that \n[Applicant] was in a building to which he did not have authorized access. \nThe final recommendation by the investigating officer was for [Applicant\u2019s] \nCamp . . . base access authorization to be revoked. (Tr. at 34, 39; GE 3-4) \nApplicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI was unaware of being terminated/fired and not \neligible for rehire as I was only told that I was released from contract. So therefore[,] I \ndeny knowing that I was terminated/fired prior to my video interview.\u201d He reiterated \nthese sentiments during his July 2020 background interview and at the hearing. He \nstated that no-one informed him that he was suspended, and he was only asked to turn \nhis DOD Common Access Card into his site lead. He was not required to formally out-\nprocess and return to the United States, and he was not barred from all installations \naround other command locations. He remained in country until early 2020, when he \nreturned to the United States to seek employment. (Tr. at 33-45, 48-56; GE 2, 4) \nWhen Applicant completed his February 2020 SCA, in response to \u201cSection 13A \n- Employment Activities,\u201d he listed his January 2016 to September 2019 employment \nwith the above-mentioned DOD contractor overseas, and he disclosed that he had been \n\u201c[r]eleased from contract\u201d by this employer in September 2019. He marked \u201cNo\u201d in \nresponse to two questions in this section and failed to disclose for this listed \nemployment that information as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a.

(GE 1) \nApplicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI admit to choosing No on this question due to \nnot knowing that I was fired from [this employment]. I was only told I was released from \ncontract. This was an honest mistake and was not intentional.\u201d He also maintained, \nduring his July 2020 background interview and at the hearing, that he did not view his \nplacement on administrative leave as a suspension. (Tr. at 33-47, 49-50; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant had no previous unfavorable incidents, and he has not had any \nunfavorable incidents since, to include with his current employer. He was not arrested or \ncharged with any offense. He expressed remorse for his actions and stated that he \nlearned his lesson. His spouse is aware of the allegations. (Tr. at 26, 34, 47-48) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nSexual harassment allegations stemming from incidents that occurred in \napproximately May 2019, between Applicant and a soldier that he met while working for \na DOD contractor overseas on a U.S. military base, were substantiated. \u00b6 13(d) applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14.

Applicant was not arrested or charged with \nany offense. He was remorseful and learned his lesson. AG \u00b6 14(b) is established. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was terminated from employment in approximately September 2019 \ndue to substantiated allegations of sexual harassment, and he is not eligible for rehire. \nAG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is established for SOR \u00b6 2.a. However, Applicant credibly testified that he \ndid not deliberately falsify his responses under section 13A of his 2020 SCA that \ninquired about his \u201cReason for Leaving . . .\u201d and whether he \u201cReceived Discipline or \nWarning.\u201d He disclosed his employment from January 2016 to September 2019 with the \nabove-mentioned DOD contractor overseas, and he disclosed that he had been \nreleased from contract by this employer in September 2019. He was never told he was \nfired, and he did not understand that his placement on administrative leave and his \nsubsequent release from the contract constituted a discipline or warning, despite being \ninformed that the sexual harassment allegations were substantiated and receiving \nnotice that he had been consequently barred from access to the job site and certain \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmilitary installations. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established for SOR \u00b6 2.b and I find that \nallegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. I considered \nrelevant AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d Applicant\u2019s termination \nfrom employment in 2019 due to substantiated allegations of sexual harassment was an \nisolated incident that occurred over four years ago. Applicant had no previous \nunfavorable incidents, and he has not had any unfavorable incidents since, to include \nwith his current employer. He was not arrested or charged with any offense. He \nexpressed remorse for his actions and stated that he learned his lesson. His spouse is \naware of the allegations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) are established for SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis. The record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the sexual behavior and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was \nassigned to me on June 7, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor, employed since 2002. \nShe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012 and a master\u2019s degree in 2013. She is divorced \nand has four adult children. This is her first time applying for a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F, that Applicant failed to file her federal tax \nreturns and is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax years 2014 \n- 2017 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h: Item 1 at 34-36; Item 6); and that she failed to file her state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014 \u2013 2017 (Item 1 at 34-36). The SOR also alleges five \nadditional delinquent debts totaling approximately $15,764.00 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.n). Applicant \nadmits the federal and state tax allegations, she admits SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n, and denies \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m. The record evidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant indicates she filed all of her federal tax \nreturns and that she is working with a tax firm/association to help her settle the tax debt \nthat is owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). They hope to arrange a monthly \npayment plan on her behalf that she can afford. They are also working on her state tax \nissues. She disputes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k and 1.m because she does not \nrecognize the debts. The $72 medical debt alleged in \u00b6 1.n is for a flu shot. Applicant was \nunder the impression she could receive the flu shot for free. She paid the bill and she now \ngets her flu shots from a local pharmacy which provides flu shots at no charge. (Answer \nto the SOR) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l is a mortgage account that is past due in the amount \nof $7,083, with a total balance of $158,617. Applicant admits that is for her home. Her \nhome has serious issues that need to be repaired related to a leaking roof. She needs to \nrefinance her mortgage to pay for the repairs. She claims the previous owner made some \nquick fixes in order to pass the home inspection. (Answer to SOR) \nIn February 2022, Applicant encountered severe health issues. She was off work \nfor six months. She appreciates the opportunity to explain her situation. She also is \nseeking budget counseling from a nonprofit organization in order to help her with a debt \nmanagement plan.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe documentary evidence in the record is sufficient to establish the disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f). Applicant failed to file her state and federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. She owes the IRS an approximate \ntotal of $48,580 in unpaid taxes for these tax years. She has several other delinquent \ndebts to include a past due mortgage account, and two consumer accounts. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20.a does not apply because most of her debts remain unresolved. AG \u00b6 \n20.b partially applies. Applicant\u2019s significant health issues in 2022 were beyond her \ncontrol. This mitigating condition is given less weight because most of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues arose well before 2022.

While Applicant \nintends to resolve her debts, she has not demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20.e: does not apply. Applicant disputes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and \n1.m, but provided no documents indicating that she submitted a formal dispute nor the \noutcome of a dispute for either debt. \nAG \u00b6 20.f applies with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g because Applicant\nfiled her federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 \u2013 2017. It does not apply with \nregard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.f and 1.h because she still owes federal income taxes for tax \nyears 2014 \u2013 2017, a total balance of approximately $48,580. It does not apply to SOR \u00b6 \n1.i because Applicant has not filed her state income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, \n2016 and 2017.\n \n \nWhen tax issues are involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nlong an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments. The Appeal Board's emphasis on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing \ngrant of security clearance and stating, \"His delay in taking action to resolve his tax \ndeficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in \njeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not \nreflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted \nwith the nation's secrets.\"). \nThe guidelines encompass concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules \nand systems is essential for protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s recent serious health issues.

Concerns under financial considerations remain. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s 20-year \nhistory as an employee of a defense contractor. I considered her recent significant health \nproblems. I find her unresolved tax debts and ongoing financial issues outweigh any \nevidence of mitigation in Applicant\u2019s case. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her financial delinquencies. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.k and 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l and 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nErin C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j and 1.l through 1.o. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.k. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 59 years old. He served in the military from 1983 to 2003 and was honorably retired. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012 and a master\u2019s degree in 2014. He was married from 1987 to 2011 and has four adult children between the ages of 34 and 27. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since July 2004. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes $37,604 in delinquent student loans (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j) and three miscellaneous debts that total $241 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k though 1.m) He admits he owes all of these debts, except SOR \u00b6 1.k ($127). This debt is reported on Applicant\u2019s October 2021 credit report. It is not reported on his March 2022 credit report.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 20, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 2 through 6 (Item 1 is the SOR). Applicant provided a \nresponse to the FORM, but did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence. His response \nwas marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections and all evidence was \nadmitted. The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j and 1.l through 1.o. \nHe denied SOR \u00b6 1.k. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 59 years old. He served in the military from 1983 to 2003 and was \nhonorably retired. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2012 and a master\u2019s degree in 2014. \nHe was married from 1987 to 2011 and has four adult children between the ages of 34 \nand 27. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since July 2004. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes $37,604 in delinquent student loans (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.j) and three miscellaneous debts that total $241 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k though 1.m) He \nadmits he owes all of these debts, except SOR \u00b6 1.k ($127). This debt is reported on \nApplicant\u2019s October 2021 credit report. It is not reported on his March 2022 credit report. \nIn addition, Applicant admits that he failed to timely file his 2019 and 2020 federal and \nstate income tax returns. (Item 2) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2021. In it, \nhe disclosed that he failed to file his 2019 federal income tax return. He stated it was \nbecause he was unable to obtain an income tax statement from the military through its \ncomputer system for his retirement pay so he could file accurately. He attempted to \ncontact the appropriate agency, but was unable to talk with a person or reset his \npassword. He requested a password be sent by mail, but had not received one. He also \ndisclosed his student loans were delinquent and he was working to resolve them. He said \nthat he had \u201cwithholdings from paycheck that have been suspended right now because \nof COVID.\u201d He indicated that the payments were made through garnishment. (Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2021. He \nconfirmed to the investigator that he had not filed his 2019 or 2020 federal and state \nincome tax returns because he could not access the online system to retrieve the \ninformation he needed about his military pension. He said he continued to attempt to use \nthe telephone and online system unsuccessfully. He told the investigator he would \ncontinue to attempt to obtain the information he needed but did not know when it would \nbe successful. He believed he owed about $500 in federal income taxes for each tax year. \n(Item 4) \nApplicant told the government investigator that in 2011 after his divorce, he went \nfrom a dual income household to a single income. He said he was solely responsible for \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nraising the children and maintaining a household. He lives paycheck to paycheck and \nreceives a military pension. He intended to satisfy all of his debts. (Item 4) \nIn April 2022, Applicant completed government interrogatories. In them, he \ndisclosed his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns were not filed. He \nreiterated that he was unable to file them because he was unable to obtain his income \ntax statement from the military and the telephone number he was given was to a general \nswitchboard, so he could not make an in-person appointment. He did not know if he owed \ntaxes for these tax years. He did not have an installment agreement with the IRS. (Item \n4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations that his student \nloans were delinquent. Some of his loans are through the Department of Education (DOE) \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e) and others are with a private creditor (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.j). On \nhis March 2022 credit report, the DOE and the private creditor loans are reflected as being \nin a collection status. His DOE loans show his last payments were in January 2018. The \nothers reflect they have been delinquent since 2016. (Items 2, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant told the investigator that in 2014, he was paying $500 a month on his \nstudent loans and in 2015 the creditor wanted $1,000, which he could not afford, but he \ncontinued to pay $500. In his personal financial statement, provided with his \ninterrogatories, he lists a monthly payment of $500 for his student loans. Applicant has \nnot provided any documentary proof as to the current status of the alleged student loans, \npast payments, or a payment agreement. Due to the pandemic, there is a moratorium on \nstudent loan payments. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he did not provide any updated information \nabout recent efforts to resolve his tax issues, status of student loans, or resolution of his \nother delinquent debts. He explained he is doing his best to overcome his financial \nproblems and does not believe it should have an impact on his eligibility to hold a security \nclearance. He has not had any security violations in the past. He said he would never \nknowingly disclose national security sensitive information. He does not live extravagantly \nand believes his years of military and government service should be considered. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as required. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans and other unpaid small consumer debts. \nHe failed to timely file his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has approximately $37,604 of delinquent student loans that are in \ncollection status. He also has some smaller debts that he did not provide any information \non his actions to resolve. These debts are ongoing and unpaid. Applicant failed to timely \nfile his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. He has not provided evidence \nof actions he has taken to file his delinquent tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2011 divorce and being \nresponsible for raising the children. This was a condition beyond his control. He attributed \nhis failure to file his tax returns to being unable to obtain his income tax statements for \nhis military pension. This was a condition beyond his control for a period. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant failed to provide evidence of his actions to resolve his \ndelinquent student loans or delinquent debts. It appears his wages were garnished to pay \nsome of his student loans. Applicant may have initially been unable to obtain income tax \ndocuments for his military pension due to computer issues that were beyond his control. \nHowever, his failure to actively pursue a resolution of this problem and allow it to continue \ninto another tax year does not constitute acting responsibly. He offered scant information \nabout what he is doing to resolve it. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nThere is some evidence that payments were being made on Applicant\u2019s student \nloans, but they were through garnishment. This is not a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. He has not offered any evidence as to his current \nefforts to resolve or create a payment plan to address his student loans or other debts. \nThere is no evidence he has received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k. It is not on his March 2022 credit report. I find for \nhim on this allegation. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b61.k. \nApplicant did not offer evidence of arrangements he made with the IRS or his state \ntax authority to file his delinquent tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s military and government service. He failed to meet \nhis burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on September 15, 2022, and \nthe hearing was convened as scheduled on November 16, 2022.

He is unmarried and has no children. He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree. He holds the position of Systems Engineer. He is seeking to obtain \na security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1995. He relocated to the United \nStates with his family in 2004. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. He \nobtained his Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. He began working for a defense contractor in \nSeptember 2020.  He has never held a security clearance before. (Tr. p. 21.) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application on August 12, 2020. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) In response to Section 18, concerning \u201cRelatives,\u201d Applicant \nfailed to disclose his brother, as required. Applicant testified that he did not want to be \nassociated with his brother and so he did not list him on the application. (Tr. p. 26.) \nWhen Applicant completed the application, this brother was incarcerated in prison for \nauto theft. At some point he was released and placed on parole. He violated parole, \nand was sent back to prison. (Tr. p. 29.) Applicant later revealed that he withheld this \ninformation from the Government because he believed that it would negatively reflect \nupon him. \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on September 23, 2020. \nDuring the interview, Applicant stated that his parents were divorced, and he did not \nspeak with his father and that he did not know his father\u2019s address. (Government \nExhibit 2.) When confronted with conflicting information that he provided on his August \n12, 2020, security clearance application, Applicant admitted that he deliberately lied to \nthe investigator at the direction of his father. His father told him to say that he did not \nlive with the Applicant, and that Applicant did not know what his father did for a living. \n(Tr. p. 31.) Applicant testified that when he met with the investigator for this interview, \nhe was actually living with his father, mother, sister and younger brother.  (Tr. p. 45.) \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in March 2022. When he was in Afghanistan, his \nfather worked as a medical doctor.  In the U.S., he worked for several years as a linquist \nfor the U.S. government. In 2014, he opened a restaurant. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant currently resides with his older brother, who is an Engineer, and his \nmother and younger brother. Applicant\u2019s mother is not employed outside of the home. \nShe remains in regular contact with her large family in Afghanistan. Specifically, her \nmother, father, grandparents, and siblings who all reside in Afghanistan. (Tr. p. 37.) \nApplicant states that he realizes what he did was wrong and stupid, and he \nregrets his decisions. (Tr. p. 34-35.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant deliberately failed to list his incarcerated brother on his security \nclearance application. \nHe also lied to the investigator about the nature of his \nrelationship with his father. He led the investigator to believe that he knew very little if \nanything about his father. He told the investigator that he did not live with his father and \nthat he did not know what he did for a living. When, in actuality, Applicant lived with his \nfather at the time and knew very well what he did for a living. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual specifically \nconcerning security processes.  Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and \ntruthfully.  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. A security clearance is a privilege and \nnot a right. To be found eligible, it must be clearly consistent with the national interests \nto grant or continue a security clearance. The decision must be made in accordance \nwith the DoD Directive and its guidelines. Based upon the information presented, \nApplicant has not been truthful to the Government on his security clearance application, \nand during a personal interview with the Government representative. His character and \nintegrity is highly questionable. \nHis conduct shows poor judgment, unreliability, \nimmaturity, and untrustworthiness, which prevents him from being eligible for access to \nclassified information. The Personal Conduct guideline is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant has received a bachelor of science degree and a master\u2019s degree. He is seeking to retain a security clearance granted in approximately 2011 in connection with his work with the DoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 43-45, 52.) Paragraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted allegation1.a under this paragraph with explanations. He denied 1.b. Applicant began using marijuana in edible form sometime between April 2017 and mid-2018. (Tr. 17-20.) He stated in his e-QIP of March 8, 2021: Shortly after [State A] legalized recreational marijuana I tried it. I was always scared of illegal drugs. I have experimented with it numerous times while in states where it has been legalized.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On May 11, 2022, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nH (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and E (Personal Conduct). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense \nafter June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on June 1, 2022, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non July 7, 2022. The case was assigned to me on July 18, 2022. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on August 4, 2022. I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled on September 7, 2022. The Government offered Government \nExhibits 1 and 2, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through K. Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 16, \n2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old Pre-Sales Solution Architect with a defense contractor. \nHe has worked for the company since 2015. He is recently married. Applicant has \nreceived a bachelor of science degree and a master\u2019s degree. He is seeking to retain a \nsecurity clearance granted in approximately 2011 in connection with his work with the \nDoD. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 43-45, 52.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted allegation1.a under this paragraph \nwith explanations. He denied 1.b. \nApplicant began using marijuana in edible form sometime between April 2017 and \nmid-2018. (Tr. 17-20.) \nHe stated in his e-QIP of March 8, 2021: \nShortly after [State A] legalized recreational marijuana I tried it. I was always \nscared of illegal drugs. I have experimented with it numerous times while in \nstates where it has been legalized. I typically take edibles that are created \nfor specific uses to support better sleep, creative thinking, stress relief and \nsocial anxiety. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23.)  \nConcerning his statements on the questionnaire Applicant testified, \u201cI wanted to be \ntruthful, and frank and open and honest. All of those things in this Questionnaire. I felt the \nmost important thing was honesty.\u201d (Tr. 19.) \nApplicant would use marijuana about once or twice a week until August 2018. At \nthat time, he moved to State B, where it was still illegal to purchase or use marijuana \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder state law. Applicant abstained from any marijuana use during the period he lived in \nState B. Instead of marijuana he used legal supplements to help him sleep. (Government \nExhibit 1 at Section 11; Government Exhibit 2 at 4, 8-9; Tr. 20-21.) \nApplicant returned to State A in November 2020. He once again purchased \nmarijuana in pill form from state-approved stores and used it two to three times a week \nuntil approximately June 2021, when he stopped all marijuana use. Altogether Applicant \nused marijuana in pill or edible form about 50 times. Applicant has abstained from any \nmarijuana use since that time and evinced a credible intent not to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He has returned to using legal supplements as a sleep aid and finds them effective. \n(Tr. 18-22, 26-29, 49-51.) \nAs stated, Applicant received a security clearance in 2011. That clearance was \nactive during the time Applicant was using marijuana. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section \n25; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 43-45.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or \nunreliability. Applicant denied the single allegation under this paragraph because he felt \nit was too vague. \n2.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that the Applicant\u2019s drug use \nhistory, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \nMitigation \nApplicant is viewed as a solid performer by his employer. He has repeatedly \nreceived recognition for his job performance. Applicant is respected by his coworkers and \nsupervisors. (Applicant Exhibits B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K; Tr. 33-36, 38-40.) \nApplicant has been singled out to be part of a special program by his employer. \nThis program is limited to a small percentage of people throughout the company. \n(Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 36-37.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana for several months from approximately mid-to-late 2017 \nto August 2018, and again from November 2020 to June 2021. During that period, he \nused marijuana in pill or other edible form about 50 times. Applicant purchased marijuana \nfrom state-approved stores. He was employed in the defense industry and held a security \nclearance during that entire period of time. All three of the stated disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana (including State A) and sought to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant used marijuana in pill form about 50 times over several years. He only \npurchased and used it in State A, where such purchase and use are legal under state \nlaw. When he lived in State B he abstained from purchase or use, since marijuana use \nwas illegal in that state. This conduct was in the past and he stated convincingly that it \nwill not be repeated. Applicant thoroughly understands the consequences of any future \ndrug use or exposure. Viewing his marijuana use in the context of the whole person, \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his past drug involvement. Paragraph \n1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs stated under Paragraph 1, above, Applicant\u2019s drug use is in the past, and he \nevinces a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future. He has mitigated any concern \nunder subparagraph 2.a. Accordingly, Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his drug \nuse. His forthright disclosures on his e-QIP, during an interview with an OPM investigator, \nand at his hearing minimized or eliminated the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. \nContinuation or recurrence of similar conduct is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not create any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom she has worked since March 2021. She earned a high school diploma in 2003 and has taken community college courses without earning a degree. She has never married and has no children. (Items 3, 5, 8) Beginning in about 2001, Applicant had upwards of six knee surgeries to repair or replace menisci and her anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. When none of these surgeries proved successful, Applicant had knee replacement surgery in about 2011. Despite the knee replacement, she continued to experience pain in her knee. For several years, she was legally taking the prescription opioid Tramadol with a prescription for pain relief related to her knee. However, in about July 2014, she quit before she was fired from her job with a government agency. She lost her insurance and her prescription for Tramadol lapsed. She was still experiencing pain and thought she needed the Tramadol, so she used it illegally, without the requisite prescription, from about August 2014 until about February 2015. She claimed that she still had a valid prescription for the Tramadol and merely refilled her prescriptions more often than her doctor authorized.

The case was assigned to me on February 15, 2023. The Government \nexhibits included in the FORM (Items 1-5) and the FORM Response are admitted in \nevidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom she has \nworked since March 2021. She earned a high school diploma in 2003 and has taken \ncommunity college courses without earning a degree. She has never married and has \nno children. (Items 3, 5, 8) \nBeginning in about 2001, Applicant had upwards of six knee surgeries to repair \nor replace menisci and her anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee. When none of \nthese surgeries proved successful, Applicant had knee replacement surgery in about \n2011. Despite the knee replacement, she continued to experience pain in her knee. For \nseveral years, she was legally taking the prescription opioid Tramadol with a \nprescription for pain relief related to her knee. However, in about July 2014, she quit \nbefore she was fired from her job with a government agency. She lost her insurance \nand her prescription for Tramadol lapsed. She was still experiencing pain and thought \nshe needed the Tramadol, so she used it illegally, without the requisite prescription, \nfrom about August 2014 until about February 2015. She claimed that she still had a \nvalid prescription for the Tramadol and merely refilled her prescriptions more often than \nher doctor authorized. There is no documentation to this effect in the record. \nRegardless, she admitted using Tramadol in a manner inconsistent with her doctor\u2019s \nprescription. From about May 2015 until about the middle of November 2015, a medical \ndoctor again prescribed her Tramadol for pain relief. She claimed that she continued to \nexperience pain in her left knee until a surgical repair of a portion of her artificial knee in \nabout September 2022. However, she has not used opioids since sometime in 2016. \n(Items 2-4; FORM Response) \nWhile Applicant claimed that she did not use opioids for pain management, she \nillegally used \u201cmedical\u201d marijuana edibles with varying frequency for pain management \nfrom about October 2020 to the present. She thought using medical marijuana was a \nbetter alternative to opioids for managing her pain. In April 2022, she obtained a \ncertification from a family nurse practitioner for the use of cannabis products in State A \nwhere she resides. She claimed she thought marijuana use was \u201clegal\u201d in State A until \nshe had her security interview in May 2021. Despite her understanding of marijuana\u2019s \nillegality, she continued to use it and obtained the certificate for the use of cannabis \nproducts after her security interview. She claimed that, on an unspecified date, she \nmade her current employer aware of her marijuana use and decided to stop using it. \nThere is no evidence in the record to corroborate this claim. Conversely, she has also \nclaimed that she will stop using marijuana once she obtains a clearance, which implies \nthat she continues to use it. (Items 2, 3, 4; FORM Response) \nFrom about December 2014 until about February 2015, Applicant fraudulently \nobtained prescriptions for Tramadol. She also fraudulently obtained at least 150 doses \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof Tramadol. She obtained these prescriptions and dosages by calling pharmacies \nposing as an acquaintance who is a registered nurse. Applicant knew the \nacquaintance\u2019s \u201cNPI\u201d number and used it during her phone calls with pharmacies to \nmislead the pharmacies into believing the prescription was valid. In February 2015, a \npharmacist suspected her prescription to be fraudulently obtained and called the police \nwhile Applicant was waiting to pick up her refill. A police officer confronted Applicant, \nand she admitted the prescription fraud. She was arrested and charged with five counts \nof prescription fraud, a class 6 felony. In May 2015, she entered into a plea agreement \nwhereby she pleaded guilty to all five felony counts. She was sentenced to two years of \nprobation, was ordered to attend drug counseling, had her driver\u2019s license suspended \nfor 30 months, and was ordered to pay fees. As part of her plea agreement, her guilty \nplea on the five felony counts was suspended for a year and all five were reduced to \nmisdemeanors when she completed the other requirements of her plea agreement on \nJune 15, 2017. It is unclear whether she has continued to attend drug counseling after \nJune 2017. (Items 2-5; FORM Response) \nFrom about 2007 until 2014, Applicant held a security clearance while she either \nworked as a contractor for a government agency or directly for the same government \nagency. In about December 2013, she failed to properly escort individuals in her \nworkspace for whom she was responsible, because she was using social media. Her \nsupervisor revoked her access to the information-technology (IT) system that allowed \nher to access social media at work. Applicant wanted to continue to access social media \nat work, so, in contravention of the government\u2019s rules for accessing its IT systems, she \nused another employee\u2019s (her mother\u2019s) access information to access the government \nIT system. Her mother told her that she should not use her mother\u2019s access information, \nbut Applicant thought it was not a big deal. In about July 2014, the government agency \nfor whom she worked determined that she was inappropriately accessing its IT system \nwith another individual\u2019s access information and gave her the option of resigning or \nbeing fired. She resigned. She lost her security clearance because of this conduct and \nblames her actions on a \u201csevere error in judgment.\u201d (Items 2-4; FORM Response) \nTo show her rehabilitation and worthiness to hold a security clearance, Applicant \ncites to the years that have passed without using opioids, engaging in criminal conduct, \nor engaging in workplace misconduct. She claimed that she has learned from her \nmistakes and now possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to \nhold a security clearance. She claimed that the level of trust that her current employer \nplaces in her is evidence of this change. (Item 2; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nApplicant illegally used the opioid Tramadol without a valid prescription from July \n2014 until February 2015. She illegally used marijuana with varying frequency beginning \nin October 2020, and she failed to provide sufficient evidence that she has stopped \nusing it. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \nApplicant has not met her burden of providing sufficient evidence to show that \nher illegal drug use has ceased. She failed to sufficiently establish a pattern of \nabstinence. AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b) do not apply. \nApplicant eventually illegally used Tramadol after legally using it for years for her \nchronic knee condition. Her use of Tramadol ceased in about 2016. While she had a \nprescription for marijuana beginning in April 2022 for pain relief for the same chronic \ninjury, marijuana use is illegal under federal law. She used marijuana for over a year \nprior to her prescription and has not provided sufficient evidence to show that her \nmarijuana use has ended. AG \u00b6 26(c) applies to her use of Tramadol but not to her use \nof marijuana and therefore partially applies. \nApplicant completed a court-ordered drug treatment program as part of her \nsentence for prescription drug fraud. However, she began illegally using marijuana after \nshe completed this program and has not presented evidence of a favorable prognosis \nby a qualified medical professional. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply. None of the mitigating \nfactors fully apply. The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nnot mitigated, except as indicated above regarding her use of Tramadol. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn February 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to five counts of felony prescription \nfraud after she illegally obtained Tramadol prescriptions and dosages by posing as a \nregistered nurse. There is sufficient evidence of criminal conduct as she pleaded guilty \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto all five counts and admitted to the criminal conduct in her plea agreement. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nWhile Applicant last engaged in prescription fraud in early 2015, she engaged in \ncriminal conduct again by illegally using marijuana beginning in October 2020. The \nevidence is unclear whether she has stopped using marijuana. She claimed that she did \nnot realize that marijuana use is illegal under federal law, but she admitted she \ncontinued to use marijuana after she understood its illegality. As she engaged in \ncriminal activity beginning in October 2020, and continues to do so, she failed to show \nthat the criminal activity is unlikely to recur or that there is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. None of the mitigating factors apply. The criminal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations.  \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; and \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn 2014, after having her authorization revoked, Applicant repeatedly accessed \nand made use of a government IT system using another individual\u2019s access information. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nIt has been about seven and one-half years since Applicant made unauthorized \naccess of an IT system. There is no bright-line rule for what amount of time without \nrecurrence constitutes \u201cso much time.\u201d While acknowledging the severity of the \nmisconduct, I find that almost 20 percent of Applicant\u2019s life without recurrence is \nsufficient to show that her prior misuse of information technology no longer casts doubt \non her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 41(a) applies. Applicant has \nmitigated the Guideline M security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, J, and M in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude she did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse, and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. She mitigated the use of information technology security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He is employed part-time by a defense contractor as a Business Financial Manager. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for three charged-off private student loan accounts totaling over $158,000. Applicant admits two of the debts, specifically 1.a., and 1.b., and denies responsibility for 1.b., and 1.c., explaining that 1.b., may have been paid by his grandson; but he is not sure, and 1.c., is not a debt, but the name of the loan servicing company for the debt listed in 1.a. Accordingly, Allegation 1.c., is found for the Applicant.

Applicant admits two of the debts, specifically \n1.a., and 1.b., and denies responsibility for 1.b., and 1.c., explaining that 1.b., may have \nbeen paid by his grandson; but he is not sure, and 1.c., is not a debt, but the name of \nthe loan servicing company for the debt listed in 1.a. Accordingly, Allegation 1.c., is \nfound for the Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated October 5, 2021, and his \nenhanced summary interview dated October 13, 2021, confirm the indebtedness set \nforth in Allegations 1.a. and 1.b. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.) \nApplicant stated that he co-signed on two student loan accounts for the benefit of his \ngrandson about ten years ago. The first student loan Applicant co-signed for is set forth \nin 1.b. of the SOR. The second loan Applicant co-signed for is set forth in 1.a. of the \nSOR. Applicant\u2019s grandson failed to pay the student loan accounts when they became \ndue. Applicant stated that he made a few payments toward the loans before they were \ncharged off, and he has made no further payments since then. \nApplicant currently lives comfortably with his pension and active income. He \nwants his grandson to re-pay the student loans, however, he stated that he understands \nthat he is responsible to pay them if his grandson does not pay them. Applicant retired \nfrom working for a Federal Civil Service in December 2011. He remained retired from \nJanuary 2012 until May 2012. He re-entered the workforce as a part-time contract \nemployee in about May 2012. He has worked for his current employer since 2018. He \ncurrently holds a security clearance which he was granted in August 2011. Applicant is \nan avid international traveler in his free time.

A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $64,324. Applicant admitted that he co-signed on the loan with \nthis creditor. Applicant learned that the debt became delinquent in January 2017. \nApplicant stated that he made a few payments on the account until it was charged off. \nApplicant understands that as co-borrower on the loan, he is guaranteeing repayment of \nthe loan. In Applicant\u2019s June 13 response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he has just \nreceived a letter from the collection agency regarding the loan. On or about June 10, \n2022, Applicant wrote back to the creditor requesting specific information as to whether \nthey had standing regarding loan payment and settlement. Applicant stated that since \nthen, they have provided a partial but not complete response. There is no evidence in \nthe record to prove that Applicant\u2019s grandson has paid the debt. Applicant has not paid \noff the debt, despite his clear ability to pay it. The debt remains owing. \n1.b. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $36,796. Applicant admitted that he co-signed on the loan with \nthis creditor. \nApplicant learned that the debt became delinquent in June 2018. \nApplicant stated that he made a few payments on the account until it was charged off. \nApplicant understands that as co-borrower on the loan, he is guaranteeing repayment of \nthe loan. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he stated that in April 2022, a change \nwas noted on his credit report stating that the lender or creditor reported that the loan \nwas no longer in derogatory status, and in the remarks section stated that there was \n\u201cpayment after charge off/collection and settled for less than full balance\u201d. Applicant \nstated that he has tried to contact his grandson to find out if he has paid anything \ntowards the debt, but he has not been successful. There is no convincing evidence in \nthe record to prove that Applicant\u2019s grandson has paid the debt. Applicant has not paid \nthe debt, despite his clear ability to pay. The debt remains owing. \n1.c. Discussed above, the SOR stated that Applicant owed a delinquent debt to a \ncreditor for an account that was charged off in the approximate amount of $57,183. \nApplicant contends that this is the same debt owed to the creditor set forth in allegation \n1.a. There is no evidence to the contrary. It appears that this entity was the loan \nservicing company for the loan set forth in allegation 1.a. Accordingly, there is nothing \nowed to this entity, and this allegation is found for the Applicant. \nOverall, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence in total mitigation. He \nhas not made a good faith effort to address the delinquent student loan debts that he \nco-signed for, nor has he taken any meaningful step to resolve these delinquencies. He \nhas submitted no documentary evidence to show that he has established an acceptable \npayment arrangement or that he is complying with a payment arrangement. There is no \nmeaningful track record of repayment. \nHe stated that he understands that he is \nresponsible to pay the debts, but he continues to ignore his legal obligations as co-\nsignor to pay them. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to two creditors for delinquent student loan accounts \ntotaling in excess of $100,000 that have been charged off for many years.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant, as the co-signer on two student loans for his grandson has defaulted \non the two loans and has refused to pay them.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been as irresponsible as his grandson by failing to pay the student \nloan debts he co-signed for. Applicant knew that the loans were delinquent back in \n2017 and 2018 respectively. He also knew that as the co-signer on the loans, he was \nresponsible to pay them if his grandson defaulted. Many years have passed since the \nloans became delinquent and ultimately defaulted. Applicant now claims that one of the \nloans may have been paid-off or settled by his grandson, but he does not know that for \nsure. Applicant stated that has not confirmed this with the creditor, nor has he spoken \nto his grandson about the matter. Applicant does know that his grandson defaulted on \nthe loan several years ago, and that the creditor was looking to the Applicant, the co\u00ad\nsigner, for payment. Applicant made a few payments towards the debts until the loans \nwere charged off. He has made no payments since then, and it does not appear that he \nplans to resolve the debts. His actions or inactions show poor judgment, unreliability, \nand untrustworthiness. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \nI \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on April 13, 2022 \n(Answer), and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.

He earned a high school diploma in 1989. He was married from \n2006 until February 2017, when he finalized his divorce. He served on active duty with \nthe U.S. Marines from 1991 until 1994, when he received an honorable discharge. He \nresides with his girlfriend, to whom he is engaged to be married. He has two adult \nchildren. (Tr. 15-18, 27; GE 1) \nAt all times relevant to this proceeding, marijuana purchase, possession, and use \nhas been illegal under federal law. Federal laws regarding marijuana supersede any \nstate laws that are inconsistent with it. Applicant was granted access to classified \ninformation at all times relevant hereto. (Tr. 17; GE 1, 2) \nIn about February 2020, Applicant traveled about 45 miles from home to \npurchase marijuana from a dispensary in State A, where it was sold legally under state \nlaw. In February and March 2020, he used marijuana on weekend nights a total of about \n16 times in order to help him sleep. He did not report his marijuana purchase, \npossession, or use to his employer or facility security officer (FSO) until he realized that \nhe would likely be caught for this use. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, \nsuch as Applicant\u2019s failure to report his marijuana purchase, possession, and use to his \nemployer or FSO, cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered \nwhen assessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person \nanalysis. On March 24, 2020, he underwent a random drug test through his employer. \nPrior to the test, he told his employer that he did not believe that he would pass the drug \ntest because he had been using marijuana. He tested positive for marijuana after taking \nthis drug test. As a result of his marijuana use and positive drug test, his employer \ncreated an incident report in the Defense Information System for Security (DISS). (Tr. \n18-22, 34-35, 37; Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nWhile using marijuana, Applicant knew it was illegal to do so. Since 1999, he \nreceived annual training regarding his responsibilities as a security clearance holder \nwith respect to illegal drugs. He knew that using marijuana violated the conditions of \nholding his security clearance and the terms of his employment. He knew that he was \nsubject to random drug testing. Applicant has sleep apnea and other unspecified \nailments. He claimed he used marijuana despite knowing it was illegal and incompatible \nwith holding a security clearance, because he was desperate to get quality sleep. His \ngirlfriend recommended that he try m\n \narijuana for his sleeping problems. A doctor did not \nrecommend or prescribe him marijuana. He did try other prescription and non-\nprescription medications to help him sleep before resorting to marijuana. (Tr. 15-19, 31-\n34, 36; Answer) \nAs a result of his positive drug test, instead of terminating him, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer suspended him without pay until he completed a substance abuse program \n(SAP). On May 2, 2020, he completed an SAP. The SAP consisted of three group \nmeetings a week for 30 days. His employer also placed him on probation for 24 months. \nWhile he was on probation, he could not be promoted. His employer required him to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntake monthly drug tests for 38 months. His employer also had him enter into a \u201cLast \nChance Agreement\u201d whereby he acknowledged that any recurrence of inappropriate \nbehavior would result in his immediate termination of employment. After his initial \npositive drug test, all of his subsequent monthly drug tests have had negative results. \nAfter he completes 38 months of monthly drug tests, Applicant will be subject to random \ndrug tests. Applicant is no longer on probation. He was promoted at work once he \nbecame eligible. He claimed that he will never use marijuana again and that he is \n\u201cscared to death\u201d because of all the trouble it has caused him. (Tr. 22-24, 36-37; \nAnswer; GE 1, 2; AE A, B) \nFrom about January 2022 until he received the SOR in March 2022, Applicant \npurchased marijuana for his girlfriend on three separate occasions. He purchased the \nmarijuana at the same dispensary in State A from which he purchased marijuana for \nhimself in 2020. He claimed that he purchased the marijuana instead of his girlfriend as \nhe received a discount because he is a military veteran. He claimed he did not \nunderstand that purchasing marijuana is illegal. He thought that he was doing nothing \nwrong as long as he was not using marijuana. He claimed that his annual training, his \nSAP and his Last Chance Agreement did not inform him that purchasing marijuana was \ninappropriate or illegal. There is no documentary evidence in the record relating to this \ntraining, the SAP, or the Last Chance Agreement. He claimed that after he received the \nSOR, he realized that purchasing marijuana is illegal, so he stopped purchasing \nmarijuana and wants nothing more to do with it. (Tr. 24-35, 37) \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend has used marijuana recreationally for at least six years and \nplans to continue to use it. She has used it a couple of times per week. She has kept \nthe marijuana in the home she shares with Applicant, but has used it on the property \noutside the house. She has used it while Applicant is home. Applicant claimed that he \ndoes not monitor her use and \u201cjust stay(s) away from it.\u201d (Tr. 24-35) \nApplicant provided character reference letters from two co-workers who know \nhim \nnoting \nhis \nreliability, \nprofessionalism, \ntrustworthiness, \nstrong \ncharacter, \nselflessness, and good work ethic. They also note that he cares for his family and has \nalways provided for them. His employer awarded him a certificate of recognition in \nMarch 2022 for his significant contribution to a work project. (AE A, B) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana \nin February and March 2020 while holding a security clearance. The SOR also alleged \nApplicant\u2019s March 2020 failed drug test and the resultant punishment from his employer. \nHe admitted the SOR allegations with additional comment.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant purchased marijuana in February 2020. He used marijuana \napproximately 16 times in February and March 2020 while granted access to classified \ninformaiton. He also tested positive for marijuana. Marijuana is a controlled substance \nand its purchase and use are illegal under federal law. He knew using marijuana was \nillegal and inconsistent with the terms of his employment and with holding a security \nclearance. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant repeatedly used marijuana despite knowing it violated the law, violated \nthe requirements of holding a security clearance, and violated his terms of employment. \nI also note the involuntary manner in which he was caught. While he stopped using \nmarijuana about two and one-half years ago, he purchased marijuana again several \ntimes in 2022, with the last purchase being about six months ago. His illegal drug \ninvolvement was therefore recent and frequent. While he claimed that he did not know \npurchasing marijuana was illegal, his willingness to involve himself with marijuana again \nafter suspension of employment, SAP training, and employment probation shows poor \njudgment and a lack of reliability. Mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nRegardless of the two and one-half year pattern of abstinence of marijuana use \nthat Applicant has established, he still resides and associates with his fianc\u00e9e who \nregularly uses marijuana and does not plan to stop. He also failed to provide a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. \nMitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. \nApplicant completed an SAP without recurrence of abuse. He did not present \nevidence of a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. Mitigating \nfactor AG \u00b6 26(d) partially applies. \nNone of the drug involvement and substance misuse mitigating conditions are \nfully applicable. For the reasons stated herein, I have ongoing concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character references and his military service. I have incorporated \nmy comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

(AE A and B) The SOR alleges ten \ndelinquent accounts, of which nine are delinquent federal student loans. The combined \ntotal of the ten delinquent debts was $40,036. His admissions are accepted as findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. Since July \n2020, he has been employed by a federal contractor. He married in November 1997. In \n2015, Applicant and his wife adopted a boy with special needs from China. He is currently \n10 years old. Applicant\u2019s annual salary is approximately $69,000, and his wife stays home \ntaking care of their son. He has occasionally picked up extra income by delivering food to \npeople for a food transportation service. (Tr. 14-15, 23, 32; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant testified that beginning in 2015, he and his spouse began to experience \nfinancial problems after traveling to China to adopt their son. He was underemployed at \nthe time, with an annual income of about $40,000, and his wife, who had previously \nworked earning an annual income of about $40,000, stayed home to take care of their \nson. Although the church provided the couple financial grants to pay for their adoption \nexpenses, the loss of his wife\u2019s income caused them to experience financial hardship. \nThey accumulated several debts he was unable to pay. His son also required various \nmedical services, and these expenses were mostly out-of-pocket. Applicant has medical \ninsurance through his employer, but his contributions to the medical providers are still \nvery expensive. They do not receive any financial assistance from the state or federal \ngovernment for the care of their disabled son. (Tr. 16-17; 26-30) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted to a car loan creditor for an account \nreferred for collection in the amount of $10,465. Applicant testified at the hearing that after \nadopting his son, he was faced with the dilemma of either providing for his family or \nkeeping the car he purchased in 2012. He was financially unable to take care of his family \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand pay for his car too. He made the decision to have the care repossessed in 2015. The \ncar was resold, and the outstanding amount was the deficiency balance he owed the \ncreditor. He made an attempt to set up a payment plan, but the creditor told him that he \nhad to pay the amount in full. (Tr. 15-18) \nIn approximately 2020, Applicant started working with a consumer debt relief \nprogram to assist him in repaying his delinquent creditors. He was able to resolve several \nmedical bills, a utility bill, and two credit card accounts. His car loan creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nwas not included the program because he received notice of a class action lawsuit that \nwas filed in 2016 against the car loan creditor. In his March 2022 SOR response, he \nstated that this creditor would no longer seek to collect on this account and any reference \nof this account was removed from his credit report as a result of the lawsuit. He attached \na notice of the class action settlement. The paperwork disclosed that the creditor \u201cwill no \nlonger seek to collect a portion of any deficiency balance.\u201d It also stated that the creditor \nwill delete trade-line information from the three nationwide consumer reporting \ncompanies. This debt is no longer collectible. (SOR response; AE A; Tr. 19-20) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, through 1.j allege nine student loans referred to the Department of \nEducation (DoED) for collection in the total amount of $29,571. Applicant testified that his \nstudent loans were deferred after his May 2015 graduation, but after the deferment \nexpired, he was unable to make payments and his loans went into default. In his March \n2022 SOR response, he stated that he had applied to the DoED loan rehabilitation \nprogram. Once his loans were rehabilitated, he would have his loans consolidated. He \nprovided documentation from DoED dated March 18, 2022. The letter provided basic \ninformation about which loans would be eligible for consolidation, and if the applicant was \napproved, the new lender would take the loans out of default status. He also provided \ndocumentation dated March 18, 2022, of his monthly income and expenses, to determine \nwhether he was eligible for the student loan rehabilitation program. (Tr. 21-22; SOR \nresponse; AE B) \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n(CARES Act) became law, providing for relief measures on DoED owned federal student \nloans through September 30, 2020. This student loan debt relief received several \nextensions. In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed \nthe DoED to place federal student loans in forbearance. The federal government \nrepeatedly extended the student loan payment pause. The pause includes the following \nrelief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and \nstopped collections on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/. (HE 2) On February 25, 2023, \nthe FSA website said: \nThe student loan payment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of \nEducation is permitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation \nis resolved. Payments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program \nhas not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June \n30, 2023 \u2014 payments will resume 60 days after that.

(HE 3) \nDuring the hearing Applicant stated he had been accepted into the loan \nrehabilitation program, but then he decided against it. He said due to the CARES Act \nonce again delaying loan payments, he decided to take advantage of not making any \npayments until July 2023. (Tr. 22- 23, 25) \nApplicant files all of his income tax returns timely and he does not owe any \ndelinquent taxes. He brings home a paycheck every two weeks in the amount of $915. \nHe estimated that his student loan payments would be around $220 a month. He is \ncurrently unable to pay that amount with his income. After his loans come out of \ndeferment, he stated he would be willing to work a second job in order to pay on his \nstudent loans. (Tr. 24, 30-37) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, as shown by his admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of incurring delinquent debts since 2015. To his credit, he \nworked with a consumer debt relief service in 2020 and paid off several delinquent \naccounts. He did not include the car loan creditor in that program because he was a \nclaimant in a class action lawsuit. Based on his documentation, this debt is no longer \ncollectible; however, the bulk of Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s nine delinquent federal student loans total $29,571, and they are \ncurrently deferred under the CARES Act. Although his student loans are currently in a \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeferment status, it is important to note that he has not made any payments to this \ncreditor, which caused them to go in default several years before the CARES Act was \nenacted. He recently received notice that he was accepted into the DoED rehabilitation \nprogram, but he chose not to rehabilitate his federal student loans. He testified that he is \nwilling to obtain a second job in order to pay his student loans once they come out of \ndeferment. This amounts to a promise to pay a debt in the future. A promise to pay a debt \nis not a substitute for a steady track record of payments or other financial responsible \naction. \nIn the context of his security eligibility, I find that Applicant did not act responsibly \nby failing to address his delinquent student loans earlier. It is clear from the SOR response \nthat he filled out the student loan consolidation and rehabilitation paperwork after he \nreceived the SOR. This does not demonstrate responsible or good-faith action since he \nonly completed the DoED forms after his access to classified information was at stake. \nI am unable to find that there were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control which \ncontributed to his financial problems. Applicant and his wife made a choice to adopt a \nyoung boy with special needs, and his wife voluntarily gave up her job to stay with their \nson. Although I greatly admire their kindhearted choices, in the context of a security \nclearance decision, these were not conditions beyond their control. Under all of these \ncircumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 52 years old. His wife stays at home and cares for their disabled son. \nHe does not currently earn enough income to repay his student loans when they become \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ndue in July 2023. Applicant testified that he had his student loans deferred after his May \n2015 graduation, but after the deferment expired, he was unable to make payments and \nhis loans went into default. He has never made a payment on his student loans. \nApplicant did not provide documentation of communications with his student loan \ncreditor once his loans became delinquent. He could have made more of an effort to have \nthe loans consolidated, rehabilitated, placed into deferment, or loan forbearance before \nthe CARES Act was enacted. He only took measures to address his student loans after \nhis receipt of the SOR. His actions demonstrate a lack of fiscal responsibility and raise \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of his delinquent student loans, he may \nwell be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude \nthat financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Tr. 26-31, 34; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant has a long and consistent history of failing to abide by established \nlaws, rules, and regulations. In April 1975, he was driving while intoxicated. He was \narrested and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). In November \n1985, he was charged with resisting arrest. A court dismissed this charge. Despite \nbeing required to do so, he did not divulge the 1975 DUI arrest on the Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in July 2020. He did not volunteer the \n1975 DUI arrest before the DOD investigator confronted him with it during his August \n2020 security interview. (Tr. 30-40; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn July 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. A \ncourt convicted him of the lesser charge of reckless conduct. The court sentenced him \nto six months of probation. In December 1987, he was arrested and charged with \naggravated assault and resisting officer-evading arrest. The court convicted him of both \ncharges and sentenced him to 12 months of probation. Applicant claimed that the July \n1986 and December 1987 arrests listed on his FBI criminal history sheet are inaccurate. \nHe claimed that he was only arrested in July 1986, and that the charges listed from his \n1986 and 1987 arrests stem from the same incident. He claimed that, during the July \n1986 incident, he merely shut the door to his home not realizing that a police officer was \nright behind him. He claimed that someone called the police because he and his wife \nwere having an argument. He denied that he was arrested or that he committed a crime \nin December 1987. (Tr. 30-34, 40-43; Answer; GE 1-3) \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s claim of not being arrested in December 1987, during his \ncross-examination, he acknowledged that arrest. He claimed that he and his brother-in\u00ad\nlaw fought one another, the police arrested him for public intoxication, and then beat \nhim when he put his watch back on so he could see what time it was. Also, during his \ntestimony, he claimed that he could not remember these incidents because it was so \nlong ago. I find his explanations about these arrests to be inconsistent at best and \ndishonest at worst. (Tr. 30-34, 40-43; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn July 1996, Applicant was involved in a bar fight. He claimed that a person that \nhe was playing pool with became angry about the outcome of their game and started a \nfight. Applicant claimed that he hit his alleged assailant in self-defense. He hit him while \nholding a knife in his hand but claimed that he did not stab him.

Police arrested him and \ncharged him with DUI. He pleaded no contest to the charge. The court convicted him of \nDUI and sentenced him to 14 days in jail. Despite being required to do so, he did not \ndivulge this arrest on his SF 86. He did not volunteer this arrest before the DOD \ninvestigator confronted him with it during his August 2020 security interview. (Tr. 35-40, \n45-46; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn September 2014, Applicant was driving while intoxicated. Police arrested him \nand charged him with DUI. He claimed that police gave him a breathalyzer test when he \nwas arrested, and that the result of the test was a .08 blood alcohol content (BAC). A \ncourt convicted him of DUI, sentenced him to one year in jail (part of which was \nsuspended and part of which he served on work-release), placed him on probation for \ntwo years, and ordered him to perform 96 hours of community service. The court also \nordered him to install an ignition interlock device on his vehicle and to take an eight-\nweek alcohol education class. He claimed that he took the class, but he could not \nremember the title of the class or where it was located. He also claimed that he took a \nyear of court-mandated alcohol-related counseling and was subject to urinalysis. He \nclaimed that he has not consumed any alcohol since he was arrested for this DUI. \nDespite being required to do so, he did not divulge this arrest on his SF 86. He \nvolunteered this arrest to the DOD investigator during his August 2020 security \ninterview before he was confronted. (Tr. 35-40, 46-47, 51-52; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn about September 2015, Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated by Company \nA because of his 2014 DUI. He did not divulge this termination on his SF 86, despite \nbeing required to do so. Instead, on his SF 86, he claimed that he had retired from \nCompany A. Applicant did not volunteer this termination before the DOD investigator \nconfronted him with it during his August 2020 security interview. He claimed that he did \nnot list this termination due to oversight. He sued Company A for wrongful termination, \nlost his claim in arbitration, and then lost again on appeal to a court of competent \njurisdiction. Given his lawsuit acknowledging that he had been terminated, I find that he \nwas being intentionally untruthful when he claimed on his SF 86 that he had retired from \nCompany A. (Tr. 35-36, 49-51; GE 1, 2) \nIn December 2019 and February 2020, Applicant\u2019s then-employer (Company B) \ndisciplined him for violations of their workplace policy. One of these violations, which \ninvolved not securing a tool, was alleged to have caused an accident. He also failed to \nproperly undergo required training. In March 2020, Company B terminated him for these \nworkplace violations. During his testimony, he claimed he is not sure why he was fired \nbecause Company B did not give him \u201cthe paper.\u201d Despite being required to do so, he \ndid not divulge this employment termination on his SF 86. He did not volunteer this \nemployment termination before the DOD investigator confronted him with it during his \nAugust 2020 security interview. Instead, on his SF 86, he wrote that he left this \nemployment with Company B because his contract ended. He also told the DOD \ninvestigator that he failed to list this termination because of oversight. During his cross-\nexamination, he testified that he did not list this termination on his SF 86 because he \nhad also been fired by two additional employers, and he did not divulge those \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nterminations, either.

(Tr. 47-48; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nAs a result of this termination, Applicant was required to surrender his site badge \nthat allowed him access to the airport where he worked for Company B. Instead of \nsurrendering his badge, in about March 2020, he improperly used it to attempt to gain \nentry to a restricted area in the same airport to attend a job interview for another \nemployer. Airport security denied him entry and attempted to confiscate his site badge, \nbut Applicant refused to surrender it because he thought he had to surrender it to \nanother individual. During cross-examination, he claimed that he did not realize that his \nbadge was no longer valid and that he was not aware of the policy that required him to \nturn in his site badge once he had been terminated. (Tr. 48-49; Answer; GE 2) \nApplicant claimed that he filled out his SF 86 to the best of his ability and that it \ntook him a week to complete. He also claimed that he contacted his employer\u2019s security \nofficer for advice on properly completing it. (Tr. 35-38) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s aforementioned arrests and \nconvictions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g) and his termination from Company B for \nworkplace violations (SOR \u00b6 1.h). It also alleged his failure to surrender his invalid site \nbadge when he was terminated by Company B, and his use of this invalid badge to \nattempt to access a restricted area (SOR \u00b6 1.i). It alleged his failures to divulge his \ntermination from Company B and Company A on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k). \nFinally, it alleged his failure to divulge his 1975, 2008, and 2014 DUI arrests and \nconvictions on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant engaged in many instances of criminal behavior over a sustained \nperiod of time. He has also been fired from a job for violations of its policies, and he \nattempted to use an invalid badge to gain access to a secured area. AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nestablished. \nApplicant did not divulge several of his arrests and terminations from \nemployment on his SF 86 despite being required to do so. His explanations and \nexcuses for not divulging this information are inconsistent and defy logic. He \ndeliberately omitted this information from his SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established with \nrespect to his omissions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant has a long and sustained history of not abiding by established laws, \nrules, and regulations.

He deliberately omitted derogatory information from his SF \n86, and he also listed inaccurate information with respect to why two employers \nterminated him. I found his excuses and explanations for his actions to be inconsistent, \nto defy logic, and to be untruthful. He has not been candid or forthcoming throughout his \nclearance application process, including during his hearing. The only mitigating factor \nthat applies is AG \u00b6 17(a), and that only applies to his volunteering his 2014 DUI before \nbeing confronted by the DOD investigator during his security interview. Given his overall \nconduct, this instance of correcting one of his omissions does not provide sufficient \nevidence of mitigation. None of the Guideline E mitigating factors fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 8, \n2022. The case was assigned to me on March 24, 2023. On May 19, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted in person on July 11, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted two exhibits marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B, which were \nadmitted without objection. Without objection, the record was left open until August 18, \n2023, to allow Applicant to submit additional exhibits. She timely submitted documents \nthat were marked as AE C through AE H and were admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on July 20, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 60 years old, married since August 1989, and has two sons, ages 30 \nand 32, and a daughter age 27. She has a bachelor\u2019s degree (1991) and a doctor\u2019s degree \n(2002). Her last employment was for another federal government agency. Her project \nthere ended in March 2023, and she is currently unemployed.. Her spouse is also \nunemployed (since June 2022). She has a top secret security clearance and is sponsored \nby a defense contractor. (GE 1 and 2; Tr. 32-33, 40, 83, 87.) \nUnder Guideline F, the May 15, 2022 SOR alleged that Applicant: (1) has an \naccount placed for collection for $494; (2) failed to file her federal income tax return for \ntax year 2013; (3) is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes of $35,336, \nand; (4) is indebted to the state for $37,778 in taxes for tax years 2009 to the present. \n(SOR). She admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a but claimed that the account has been satisfied. She \ndenied SOR \u00b6 1.b and claimed that all federal tax returns and amended tax returns have \nbeen filed. She admitted SOR \u00b6 1.c but is waiting for a payment plan with the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) to be approved. She denied SOR \u00b6 1.d and claimed that the state \nreleased that tax delinquency. (Answer.) \nApplicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.a, an account in collection for $494. \nWith her Answer, she included a receipt for $148. She testified that the receipt was her \nevidence of paying this account. She could not recall what type of account it was or what \ntype of purchase it was. She did not receive any notices from the creditor that it was \ndelinquent. The receipt is dated October 2020, and she met with the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) investigator in October 2020, who brought this account to her \nattention. She thought her husband had handled this account. She settled this account \nafter the meeting with the investigator. (Tr. 49-55.) SOR \u00b6 1.a has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.b, which alleged that she failed to \nfile her federal income tax return for tax year 2013, as required. Her Answer denied that \nallegation. Applicant testified that she was sure they had filed returns for 2009 to 2020 or \n2 \n SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n2021. She was not sure exactly when. (Tr. 66-70.) She produced her 2013 federal income \ntax return for tax year 2013 showing that it was filed on July 16, 2015. (AE C.) She \nadmitted that she had been irresponsible in failing to file her tax returns on time and had \n\u201cnot been paying very close attention to [her] tax situation.\u201d (Tr. 65-66; GE 2 at 19.) SOR \n\u00b6 1.b has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.c, which alleged that she is indebted \nto the Government for delinquent taxes of $35,336 for tax years from 2009 to the present. \nShe admitted that allegation and claimed that she is awaiting a payment plan from the \nIRS. \nApplicant was directed to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, an IRS Form 656, Offer in \nCompromise. (Tr. 82.) That exhibit was signed by Applicant and her spouse on June 29, \n2023. (Tr. 24-25.) The exhibit states that her plan is to pay $105,000 over 24 months \n($4,375 per month), but the SOR states the amount owed is about $35,000. Applicant \nexplained that the $105,000 was an offer, but the amount owed is approximately \n$200,000, which includes interest, late fees, and penalties. She submitted this offer \nthrough her revenue officer at the IRS. She has not heard back from the IRS with the \nofficial paperwork. The revenue officer does not have authority to approve an Offer in \nCompromise. That officer is Applicant\u2019s liaison to the IRS. The Offer in Compromise is \nstill pending. (Tr. 83-86, 94-96.) \nApplicant was asked how she would be able to pay the $4,375 per month she put \nin her Offer in Compromise. She explained that she was waiting for several offers that \npaid \u201cwell over $100 an hour.\u201d There were several opportunities if her \u201cclearance was \ngranted.\u201d She also had offers from local governments and federal contractors that do not \nrequire a clearance. Some of those opportunities are \u201cnot an offer letter, but . . . if they \nlike my resume\u2019 then I can get a job.\u201d (Tr. 118-121.) \nApplicant testified that she cannot have a payment plan with IRS until there is an \napproved Offer in Compromise. She could, however, make \u201cgood faith\u201d payments to the \nIRS, so she gave her spouse money to make such payments. They were \u201csporadic\u201d \npayments made before and after her October 2020 meeting with the OPM investigator. \nShe made those payments from 2020 until she stopped working. Her spouse made \u201csmall \npayments\u201d to the IRS from 2009 to 2015. (Tr. 86-89.) She produced documentation \nshowing two \u201cgood faith\u201d payments. One was $503 for tax year 2018 received by IRS on \nNovember 18, 2021. The second was $1,500 for tax year 2020 received by IRS on \nDecember 13, 2021. (AE F and AE G.) SOR \u00b6 1.c has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.d, which alleged that she is indebted \nto the state for $37,778 in taxes for tax years 2009 to the present. She was directed to a \nspreadsheet in Government Exhibit 2, page 21. She prepared this spreadsheet using her \nstate tax returns that were actually filed for tax years 2009 through 2021. It tracked her \ntaxes owed and tax refunds due for that time period. Between 2009 and 2021, she had a \n$3,022 total net credit. (Tr. 102-105.) This spreadsheet assisted her in convincing the \nstate to issue the April 23, 2021 tax release (for $43,301) that is part of her Answer. She \nhas satisfied her state tax obligation. (Tr. 104-105.)

Her three children live with her and her husband, and they \nsupport the children. She testified about her sources of income. Her spouse worked for \nthe Government for seven years and has a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but she does not. \nShe has never been a government employee and was always a contractor. She has no \nretirement fund. The TSP is one of their sources of income. She does not know the current \nbalance, but it started at $85,000. Her spouse only makes withdrawals as needed. When \nhis job was eliminated, he received $8,000 per month ($40,000 total) in severance. (Tr. \n108-112, 123.) \nApplicant has two cars. Her business car is a 2015 model she bought in 2021. Its \nengine is dead. The repair would cost $33,000; she paid $43,000 for it. She has filed a \nLemon Law claim. Her monthly payment is $798. (Tr. 113.) \nApplicant\u2019s family car is a 2012 model. She owes about $3,000 to $4,000 on it. \nShe is a couple of months behind on both car payments. (Tr. 113-114.) \nApplicant has no health care coverage. She has one unpaid medical bill for $300. \n(Tr. 117-118.) \nFood is about $2,000 per month. Utilities are about $800 to $1,000 per month. (Tr. \n112, 115.) \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage is $4,000 per month. This is the second month she has not \npaid the mortgage. (Tr. 111.) \nThe family entertainment is cable, cellphones, and the Internet, about $800 per \nmonth. They do not dine out. Applicant\u2019s hobby is watching documentaries. (Tr. 115-116.) \nApplicant visited her daughter at medical school five times between 2017 and \n2019. Each trip cost about $1,000. Applicant used credit cards to pay for those trips. Other \nthan those trips, Applicant has not taken any vacations or tours. (Tr. 129-132.) \nApplicant\u2019s sons are in college, and they graduate in 2024. Her daughter returns \nto medical school for September 2023 through December 2023, which is her last \nsemester. (Tr. 132.) \nOnly Applicant\u2019s oldest son contributes to the household income, about $400 per \nmonth. (Tr. 111.) \nApplicant keeps expenses as low as possible, just food, utilities, and cars; she \ndoes not send out dry cleaning. She and her family are living on credit cards. Her credit \ncard balance is about $16,000. (Tr. 112, 116-117,126-127.) \nApplicant\u2019s checking account balance is usually negative $1,000.

(GE 2.) She also retained a credit-repair service in about 2018 or 2019. She is not \ncurrently receiving financial counseling. (Tr. 127-128.) \nApplicant\u2019s two credit reports show the following financial picture (other than back \nfederal taxes). The October 2020 report shows 30 accounts. All accounts are PAYS AS \nAGREED. (GE 4.) The January 2022 report shows three collection accounts, one for $561 \nthat is marked PAID, one for $5,534 that is marked DISPUTED and CHARGED OFF, and \none for $233 that is open. (GE 3.) Applicant\u2019s financial status has apparently not yet been \nreflected on the two credit reports in the record. The record does not show a history of \nnot paying or an unwillingness to pay her household or consumer debts. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nOnly the following is potentially applicable in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or . . . pay annual \nFederal, [or] state income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s tax liabilities are established by her admissions. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could potentially mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received \u2026 financial counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source . . . and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s federal income tax woes began many \nyears ago, dating to 2009. That was, of course, long ago. Those troubles, however, persist \nto this day and have yet to be unraveled and solved. Applicant only recently, on June 29, \n2023, signed an IRS Offer in Compromise. It has not been approved by the IRS. She \nadmitted that the debt owed to IRS is $200,000. Her offer was to pay $105,000 over 24 \nmonths at $4,375 per month. Those terms proposed by Applicant and her spouse seem \nunrealistic for them to meet, even if the IRS approves the offer. They are both unemployed \nand living on credit cards. They are behind on their mortgage and car payments with \nusually a negative balance in their checking account. Only one of their three adult children \nwho live with them contributes to the family budget.

Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has two requirements. First, the conditions causing financial problems \nmust have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d an applicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must have \n\u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse circumstances she confronted. Applicant\u2019s and her \nspouse\u2019s recent loss of employment are conditions largely beyond her control. She \nadmitted, however, that she had been irresponsible in failing to file her tax returns on time \nand had \u201cnot been paying very close attention to [her] tax situation.\u201d Thus, her loss of \nemployment did not cause her tax problems. It was irresponsible conduct in the past that \ncaused those problems. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant has received financial counseling in the \npast, which is to her credit. There are, however, no indications that such counseling has \nresolved her outstanding federal income tax problems or brought them under control. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not provide any significant mitigation. \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(g). The analysis under AG \u00b6 20(a) above applies \nequally here. There is no IRS-approved arrangement in place. To her credit, Applicant \ndid make two \u201cgood faith\u201d payments to the IRS (totaling $2,003) to be applied to back \nincome taxes owed. That does not, however, satisfy this mitigating condition \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her delinquent federal income taxes. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n \n Conclusion\nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant also discussed her drug use with the investigator during \nher personal subject interview (PSI) in September 2021, and in her answer to the SOR. \nIn response to the questions under Section 21 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity on her August 2021 e-QIP, Applicant set forth her use of illegal drugs and misuse \nof prescription drugs.

She disassociated herself from all her other drug-using associates at this \nuniversity. \nIn March 2017, while Applicant was visiting her remaining friend at the university \nApplicant previously attended, she used LSD on a single occasion.

However, she told the investigator during \nher PSI that she used cocaine on another occasion while hanging out with the same \nfriends. She disassociated herself from the people with whom she used cocaine. \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she also used MDMA one time and misused \nAdderall one time in October 2017. She characterizes the use of these two drugs as \nexperimental. \nBetween June and December 2018, Applicant characterizes her marijuana use as \nfrequent, smoking marijuana on a weekly basis, primarily with her two housemates. One \nof her housemates was her remaining friend from the university Applicant previously \nattended. In June 2018, Applicant used LSD with her housemates. She characterizes this \nuse as experimental.

She stated in her PSI that she misused Adderall a total of six to eight \ntimes total. Between January and June 2019, Applicant used marijuana on an occasional \nbasis with her remaining housemate. In March 2019, Applicant used LSD with her \nhousemate. She also used MDMA one time in March 2019. Applicant characterizes the \nuse as of these two drugs as experimental. Applicant has not associated with her former \nhousemate since December 2019. \nBetween June and August 2019, Applicant did not use any illegal drugs or misuse \nany prescription drugs because she was living in a \u201cdrug-free environment.\u201d Applicant \nwas living with her father. \nApplicant stated on her e-QIP that in August 2019, she moved into a new house \nwhere she had not met most of the people who also lived there. Applicant was unaware \nthat her housemates were drug users until after she had moved in. While living there until \nMarch 2020, Applicant describes her marijuana use as \u201cvery occasional.\u201d She also \n\u201coccasionally used LSD and experimented with DMT and psilocybin mushrooms.\u201d She \nstated that she used DMT one time and MDMA one time in October 2019 and psilocybin \nmushrooms one time in February 2020.

She stated that she used the \nmushrooms with friends, however she felt nauseous and vomited both times she used \nthem. \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she purchased marijuana from August 2015 \nuntil September 2020 \u201cfrom former drug-using associates on a small scale, for myself to \nuse, occasionally during this time period.\u201d \nBetween September 2018 and September 2019, Applicant purchased a small \namount of MDMA from a former associate. She also attempted to purchase MDMA online \non the \u201cdark web.\u201d \nThe dark web is the set of webpages on the World Wide Web that cannot \nbe indexed by search engines, are not viewable in the standard web \nbrowser, require specific means (such as specialized software or network \nconfiguration) in order to access, and use encryption to provide anonymity \nand privacy for users. https://www.merriam-webster.com \nIn March 2017, Applicant purchased LSD one time from a friend. On her e-QIP, \nshe explained that in September 2019 she purchased LSD through the \u201cdark web\u201d while \na friend guided her through the transaction. She stated she \u201cwas hesitant to use this \nmethod ever again and so did not.\u201d She also stated that she \u201cmay have exchanged cash \non other occasions as well but I do not remember exact dates or times.\u201d During her PSI, \nApplicant stated that she would purchase LSD on the \u201cdark web\u201d and it would then be \nmailed directly to her home. \nBetween October 2017 and December 2019, Applicant purchased Adderall from a \nfriend who had it. On her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she did not ever purchase cocaine. \nIn September 2019, she attempted to purchase cocaine on the \u201cdark web,\u201d however, she \nwas not successful. She submitted her payment and after the transaction was complete, \n\u201cit was clear that I would not receive this product.\u201d \nThroughout her responses to the drug-related questions on the e-QIP, Applicant \nrepeatedly listed the mitigating factors regarding her past drug use. Specifically, Applicant \nnoted her disassociation from her drug-using associates and her move in March 2020 out \nof an environment where drugs were used. \nIn March 2020, Applicant moved out of the house she had been living in with \nhousemates since August 2019 and moved in with her mother. In her e-QIP, she states, \n4\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nI moved out in March 2020 to avoid the environment were drugs were used, \nand have not kept in close contact with these people (outside of seeing two \nof these people for lunch on two separate occasions, where there was no \nalcohol or drug use involved). This demonstrates my disassociation from \nthese drug-using associates, as well as my changing or avoiding this \nenvironment were drugs were used.\u201d \nApplicant continued to use illegal drugs from March 2020 until March 2021. Her \nlast stated marijuana use was in June 2020. She describes her other drug use as follows: \nOccasional LSD use. One MDMA experimental use. Two of the LSD use \ncases were with two other people, one of whom is a friend I made in college, \nand the other was someone she went to high school with that I am not close \nwith. Since then, the friend I made in college has also, like me, made the \ndecision to lead a drug-free lifestyle. Another LSD use case was a situation \nwhere I was the only user, and was with a friend who is not a drug user. \nThis friend is very encouraging of me leading a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. \nThe final LSD and MDMA use case was with a friend who did not use LSD, \nbut used MDMA. This incident was potentially a contributing factor to this \nfriend\u2019s subsequent hospitalization. Since this incident, this friend and I \nhave both resolved to commit to a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. \nIt is unclear from Applicant\u2019s statements in her e-QIP and during her PSI if she \npurchased the marijuana, MDMA, and LSD that she used between March 2020 and \nMarch 2021, or how she otherwise obtained these drugs. \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant concluded her comments with the following statement: \nOverall, I acknowledge my former drug involvement and substance misuse \n. . . I have provided [evidence] of my actions that I have taken to mitigate \nconcern. I have disassociated from drug-using associates and contacts, \nand have changed and avoided the environment where drugs were used in \nthe past. I have an excellent support system of substance-free friends and \nfamily members, and am committed to and look forward to continuing to \nlead a healthy, happy, and drug-free life. \nApplicant stated during her PSI that she went through an experimental phase of \ndrug use while attending college and feels she has passed that period. She further stated \nthat she no longer associates with the same crowd of people and she is focused on her \ncareer and future. With her answer, Applicant provided a statement of intent to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance misuse wherein she acknowledged that future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. Applicant \nstated her answer to the SOR that she disclosed her prior drug use to her employer. \nHowever, there is nothing in the record that suggests that Applicant\u2019s employer or any \nother entity with the power to revoke Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility is screening \nher for illegal drug use or substance misuse.  \n5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn her April 2022 answer to the SOR Applicant stated: \nI acknowledge my drug involvement and substance misuse.

I have \nnot use substances since March 2021, and am demonstrating this \ncontinued sobriety by submitting to voluntary monthly drug tests with my \ndoctor since April 2022. \nIn the college environment I was a part of, drug use was normalized. This \nconsistent normalization in such an adolescent environment led to my drug \nsubstance misuse. Because of this normalization and, quite frankly, my \nstupidity at the time, I did not fully realize the impact of my actions, both on \nmy internal health and on my future career prospects. It was not until a friend \nof mine was hospitalized in March 2021, in part due to the substance use \nwe both partook in, that I really had a wake-up call and realized how poorly \nI had been treating my health. That realization, combined with the \nrealization that many of the serious career aspirations I had would require \na drug-free lifestyle, is what led me to making the decision to halt all \nsubstance misuse for good. I have not used drugs or misused substances \nsince March 2021. \nAdditionally, I have begun the process of seeking counseling with a licensed \nclinical therapist not only discuss how my past misjudgments have affected \nme, but also take a drug evaluation assessment to demonstrate an \napplicable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

However, from 2015 through March 2020, \nshe continued to make friends with and live with drug-using associates. Applicant also \nminimizes magnitude of her drug use on her e-QIP by referring to each of multiple uses of \nthe same drugs as \u201cexperimental.\u201d Additionally, she refers to having purchased LSD on \nmultiple occasions as having possibly \u201cexchanged cash\u201d for the drugs. Further, on her e-\nQIP, Applicant stated that she used cocaine twice and psilocybin mushrooms once. \nHowever, during her PSI, she admitted that she used cocaine three times and psilocybin \nmushrooms two times. \nApplicant emphasizes that in March 2020 she moved out of the house where her \nhousemates were drug users with whom she regularly used various drugs, \u201cto avoid the \nenvironment were drugs were used.\u201d She moved in with her mother where she currently \nresides. Yet, between March 2020 in March 2021, Applicant continued to use illegal drugs. \nSpecifically, at various points during this time period, Applicant used marijuana, DMT, \nMDMA, and LSD. She also continued to illegally purchase drugs. \nApplicant asserted that beginning in April 2022, she voluntarily underwent monthly \ndrug testing. She did not provide the results of any of those tests. Additionally, Applicant \nstated that she was actively seeking counseling to address her issues related to her prior \nillegal drug use and prescription drug misuse. There is no supporting documentary \nevidence that she is or was participating in counseling. Applicant did submit a statement \nof intent to abstain from future drug use, however, there is no evidence that shows that \nApplicant is subjected to any type of drug screening through her employment. \nThere are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the \nevidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn considering the totality of the evidence, particularly Applicant\u2019s long period of \nillegal drug use from 2015 until 2021, to include purchasing illegal drugs and prescription \ndrugs not prescribed to her, her minimizing of her drug-using conduct, and her repeated \ndisassociation with drug-using associates followed by Association with different drug-\nusing associates, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal use was recent and casts doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Further, the record does not \ncontain any corroborating evidence of Applicant\u2019s assertions that she no longer uses \nillegal drugs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant reported her illegal drug use and purchases and her prescription drug \nabuse and purchases on her e-QIP, discussed her drug-related conduct during her PSI, \nand admitted each of the SOR allegations and discussed her drug-related conduct in her \nanswer to the SOR. However, she is dismissive about her extensive illegal drug use and \ndrug-related conduct, stating that the normalization of drug-use in her college \nenvironments was the catalyst of her behavior. Yet, after she graduated from college in \nDecember 2019, she continued to use and purchase illegal drugs until March 2021. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she \nhas not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He makes $17 an hour and regularly works overtime. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance.

During the hearing, Applicant stated he received disability benefits beginning in approximately 2008, after he suffered a neck injury on the job and was unable to work. His benefits were extended after he had shoulder surgery. He listed on the January 2021 SCA that he was self-employed as a barber from January 2008 through November 2019, during the approximate ten-year period he received disability benefits.

During the \nhearing, Applicant stated he received disability benefits beginning in approximately \n2008, after he suffered a neck injury on the job and was unable to work. His benefits \nwere extended after he had shoulder surgery. He listed on the January 2021 SCA that \nhe was self-employed as a barber from January 2008 through November 2019, during \nthe approximate ten-year period he received disability benefits. In about 2018, the SSA \ndetermined Applicant no longer met the requirements to receive disability benefits, and \nthat he had been overpaid disability benefits for over two-and-one-half years. Applicant \nappealed this decision and lost. He testified that he worked as a part-time barber from \n2008 to 2019 in an effort to earn a little extra money. Since his neck injury in 2008, he \nreturned to a full-time job in November 2019 after he was hired by another employer as \na security guard. (Tr. 21-35-36; GE 2, 3; AE E, I) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant agreed he received disability benefits for about ten \nyears. He received about $800 monthly from the SSA. When questioned about whether \nhe notified the SSA that he was working as a barber while he was considered disabled \nand unable to work, he responded, \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure I did.\u201d The SSA determined that \nApplicant was required to repay the overpayment of disability benefits in the amount of \n$25,554. In 2021, he requested the SSA forgive this debt. Applicant testified that he is \nstill waiting to hear from the SSA to see if this request will be granted. (Tr. 24-33; AE C) \nApplicant first testified that he had been making monthly payments to the SSA for \nabout a year. Based on the evidence he provided, he actually made his first payment of \n$100 to the SSA in September 2022. There is no other documentation to show he made \nother payments to the SSA. Applicant was asked if he could provide documentation of \nhis history of payments and the date he notified the SSA that he was working as a \nbarber, to which he agreed. No documents were submitted by Applicant while the \nrecord was held open. This debt is unresolved.

After paying monthly \nexpenses, to include to one of his delinquent credit cards listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d, they had \na monthly net remainder of about $1,340. Immediately after the hearing, Department \nCounsel provided Applicant a new PFS to complete because the 2021 PFS was dated. \nApplicant agreed he would provide the updated PFS while the record was held open. \nHe did not submit this information. (Tr. 49-54; GE 3) \nApplicant provided contradictory information during cross-examination about \nwhether his federal and state income tax returns were filed for tax year (TY) 2021.

He later claimed the 2021 federal and state income taxes were filed, \nbut they owed delinquent 2021 income taxes, amount unknown. Department Counsel \nmade a motion to amend the SOR, and Applicant was given two weeks to respond to \nthe motion and provide updated tax information for TY 2021.

(SOR \u00b6 1.e) (Tr. 54-56, 61-65) \nPersonal conduct: \nApplicant completed his SCA in January 2021. He did not disclose any adverse \nfinancial information under Section 26 of the application, as required. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He \nwas interviewed in February 2021 by an authorized DOD investigator during his \nbackground investigation. When asked if Applicant had any delinquent accounts within \nthe last seven years, he said \u201cNo.\u201d The investigator confronted him with an unpaid \n$6,851 medical account and two charged-off credit card accounts totaling $4,785. \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the medical bill, but he did recognize the two credit \ncard accounts. He was unaware that both credit card accounts were delinquent since \nhis wife handled the finances in the household. The investigator also confronted \nApplicant with the account placed for collection by the SSA in the amount of $25,554. \nApplicant stated that this account developed due to an overpayment of disability \nbenefits that were paid to him from approximately 2008 to 2018. He was notified by the \nSSA in about 2018 of the overpayment and that he was required to reimburse this \nfederal agency. He was unaware that his overpayment account was referred for \ncollection.

The report in evidence \nshowed that Applicant was confronted about the SSA overpayment account and that he \ndid not voluntarily disclose this information when questioned about delinquent debts by \nthe investigator. (Tr. 41-49; GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 says that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds\u2026. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19, and the following three are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence in the record and Applicant\u2019s admissions show unresolved \ndelinquent debt and his failure to pay income taxes for TY 2021. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017); See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant requested the SSA to forgive the overpayment of $25,554 in disability \nbenefits that he received for over two-and-one-half years when he was not entitled to \nreceive these benefits. He did not provide any documentation that he is no longer liable \nfor this debt, or that he has been making systematic monthly payments to the SSA. He \ninformed the SSA that the injuries he sustained in 2008 prevented him from working, but \nhe continued to work during the ten-year period he received disability benefits. Applicant \nclaimed he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d he had notified the SSA he was working as a barber, but \nhe did not provide supporting documentation of this notification, as requested. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2021 PFS showed he had a monthly net remainder of \nabout $1,340 after paying his monthly expenses.

He did not provide documentation \nto show whether he had resolved the 2021 outstanding tax debt. His financial problems \nare not resolved. His failure to adequately address his financial issues over time casts \ndoubt on his reliability and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant was aware he had an outstanding balance of over $25,500 owed to the \nSSA when he completed his SCA. He deliberately failed to disclose this information on \nhis SCA, as required. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant made a good-faith effort to correct the \nomission before he was confronted with the facts during his February 2021 background \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterview.

He also \ndenied that he was confronted by the investigator about his SSA overpayment account, \nbut after reviewing the signed interrogatory with an attached summary report, he was \nconfronted by the investigator about this information. Applicant intentionally omitted the \nSSA overpayment account when he filled out the SCA in January 2021. I find his \nomission casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) \nand (c) do not apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant received disability \nbenefits beginning in 2008 that continued for approximately ten years. During the ten \nyears he received the benefits due to his inability to work, he was self-employed as a \nbarber for additional income. The evidence shows that he made a single $100 payment \non this significant government debt, and that first payment was made one month after \nthe SOR was issued. He failed to provide documentation to show the current status of \nhis 2021 unpaid taxes, or that he settled the unpaid medical account, his second largest \ndebt. He intentionally failed to disclose his SSA overpayment debt on his January 2021 \nSCA. Applicant\u2019s finances and personal conduct raise security concerns about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I have questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to classified material or assignment to \nsensitive duties. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.
