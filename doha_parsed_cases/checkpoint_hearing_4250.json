(Items 2, 3) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $28,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). Other than the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nwhich appears to be a cable or internet account, the evidence does not specify the \nnature of these accounts. He admitted the SOR allegations except for the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, which he denied. He provided no additional information in his Answer \nregarding these debts, or a basis for his denial of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. His admissions \nare adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are established through his \nadmissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. The Government\u2019s credit reports \nreflect that the SOR debts became delinquent between February and March 2022. \n(Items 1, 3-5) \nApplicant became delinquent on the SOR debts because he was having a hard \ntime adjusting to civilian life after he left the military. He was also unemployed for about \nfour months beginning in March 2017. He acknowledged that he forgot to cancel the \ncable account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but he claimed during his April 2022 security \ninterview, that he thought he had paid this account. During his interview, he also \nclaimed he was not aware of the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, but that he \nwould promptly investigate them. He provided no additional evidence that the accounts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d were not his and admitted them in his Answer. (Items 1, 3-5) \nThe only evidence Applicant provided that he attempted to resolve the SOR \ndebts is a monthly budget that reflects monthly payments to the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.c. He did not provide any independent documentary corroboration of these \nmonthly payments, such as bank account statements or creditor acknowledgement of \npayments or a payment arrangement. He provided no evidence concerning the possible \nresolution of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. As he has not provided documentary corroboration, \nI cannot find that his SOR debts are resolved or being resolved. He estimated that he \nhas about $1,767 in surplus funds at the end of each month. He provided no evidence \nthat he has undergone financial counseling. (Items 1, 3-5; AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has multiple delinquent debts, all of which have been delinquent for \nabout a year and a half. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIt is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts, but he has not. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). As he has not provided this documentation, Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. He has not provided sufficient \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence that he has resolved or is resolving his SOR debts. He has not established a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were arguably caused by circumstances largely \nbeyond his control. However, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he must also show that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He has not done so because he has not provided \nsufficient evidence of his resolution efforts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. The lack of \nsufficient evidence of any resolution of his SOR debts also means that AG \u00b6 20(d) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant\u2019s basis to dispute the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e was that he thought he had \npaid it. This is a reasonable basis to dispute a debt. However, he did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate the basis of the dispute, such as bank account \nstatements or receipts. He also did not provide evidence of any actions he took to \nresolve the dispute. His monthly budget, which lack corroboration, does not include this \ndebt. For these reasons, AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). He failed to address the one factual allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), and his silence in that regard is considered as a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an aircraft mechanic with his current employer since February 2020. He was previously employed as a grocery store stocker (May 2010 \u2013 March 2012). He is a 2009 high school graduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in March 2012 and remained on active duty until February 2020, when he was discharged as an E-5. He was granted a secret clearance in 2012. He has never been married. He has one child, born in 2021. Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct When Applicant completed his SF 86, he reported in Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, that in the last seven years, his use of alcohol had never had a negative impact on his work performance, his professional or personal relationships, his finances, or resulted in intervention by law enforcement or public safety personnel.

Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) \nand J (Criminal Conduct), and detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable \nto find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nOn April 10, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by DOHA on May 22, 2023, and \nhe was afforded an opportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was \nfurnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his \ncase. Applicant received the FORM on June 20, 2023. His response was due on July 20, \n2023. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for as of September 28, 2023, when \nthe case was assigned to me, no response had been received. The record closed on July \n20, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). He failed \nto address the one factual allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), and his \nsilence in that regard is considered as a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the \nrecord, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of \nfact: \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas an aircraft mechanic with his current employer since February 2020. He was previously \nemployed as a grocery store stocker (May 2010 \u2013 March 2012). He is a 2009 high school \ngraduate. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in March 2012 and remained on active duty until \nFebruary 2020, when he was discharged as an E-5. He was granted a secret clearance \nin 2012. He has never been married. He has one child, born in 2021. \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86, he reported in Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, \nthat in the last seven years, his use of alcohol had never had a negative impact on his \nwork performance, his professional or personal relationships, his finances, or resulted in \nintervention by law enforcement or public safety personnel. Nevertheless, he did admit \nthat he was involved in alcohol-related incidents that required that he undergo alcohol \ncounseling or treatment. (Item 3 at 34-35) He also reported in Section 22 \u2013 Police Record, \nseveral alcohol-related incidents that resulted in law enforcement intervention and court \nresolutions. (Item 3 at 28-32) \nIt is unclear when Applicant first started consuming alcohol, for the issue was never \nexplored by the investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) who \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ninterviewed him on December 14, 2021, and Applicant did not report it either in his SF 86 \nor during his OPM interview. The earliest evidence in the record of Applicant\u2019s relationship \nwith alcohol took place in 2014 when he and three friends were drinking somewhere in \nthe desert. No mention was made of the type or quantity of the drinks consumed. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with alcohol has resulted in at least two separate alcohol-\nrelated incidents involving police and court authorities. Those incidents, admitted by \nApplicant in his Answer to the SOR, and described in official court and police documents, \nas well as by Applicant in his SF 86, and during his OPM interview, are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 2.a.: On or about April 15, 2017, when he was 25 years old, \nApplicant was arrested by the state highway patrol and charged with (1) driving while \nunder the influence of any alcoholic beverage, and (2) driving while having a 0.08% or \nhigher blood alcohol, both misdemeanors. He was represented by an attorney. Upon his \nplea of guilty to the second charge, the first charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to \nprobation for thirty-six months; fines and fees totaling approximately $2,377; eight days \nin the county jail (reduced to six days with credit for time served); and ordered to complete \na 90-day in-person Driving Under the Influence (DUI) Program. Applicant satisfied the \ntrial court judge that he had successfully complied with his sentence, and the case was \nclosed in September 2020. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 28-31; Item 6 at 8; Item 8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and 2.a.: On or about April 10, 2021, Applicant was again arrested by \nthe state highway patrol. He failed the field sobriety tests and the breathalyzer test and \nwas charged with (1) driving while under the influence of any alcoholic beverage, and (2) \ndriving while having a 0.08% or higher blood alcohol, both misdemeanors. He did not \nreport the arrest until five months later when he submitted his SF 86. Upon his plea of no \ncontest to the second charge, the first charge was dismissed. He was sentenced as a \nDUI 2nd  offender to probation for three years (suspended); fines and fees totaling \napproximately $1,883; ten days in the county jail; eight days of community service; and \nordered to complete an 18-month DUI Program. (Item 2 at 2; Item 3 at 31-32; Item 4 at 3, \n7; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 9; Item 7)  \nAs the sentence was imposed on September 7, 2022, it appears that Applicant\u2019s \nperiod of probation has not yet expired, and there is no evidence to indicate that it had \nbeen terminated by the trial court. (Item 7 at 2) In addition, Applicant claimed to have \ncompleted his DUI Program in March 2023, but he did not submit any verifying \ndocumentation to confirm his claim. Moreover, in April 2023, he stated that his fines were \n\u201ccurrently being paid.\u201d (Item 2 at 2) In the absence of such documentation, I am unable \nto determine that Applicant has satisfied the trial court that the sentence has been \nsuccessfully completed, or that the case has been closed. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: Applicant received court-ordered out-patient alcohol counseling from \na community services facility from about October 2017 to about February 2018. He did \nnot submit any documentation to describe the program or counseling reports to verify his \nparticipation in the program. Nevertheless, the trial court was satisfied by the \ndocumentation that it had apparently received, and it considered the cased closed.

(Item 4 at 7) In the absence of such \ndocumentation I am unable to determine if he participated in, or successfully completed, \nthe program. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.: Although Applicant was arrested and convicted of driving while having \na 0.08% or higher blood alcohol on two occasions four years apart, he never \nacknowledged that he was a maladaptive alcohol user although he recognized the fact \nthat alcohol contributed to the incidents. He believed he was fine to drive after drinking. \nHe claimed that before the DUI charges, without specifying whether it was related to one \nor both incidents, he ate a meal and consumed three or four beers. He claimed that \nalcohol affects his behavior by making him happier and more talkative. Because he now \nhas a child he drinks and goes out less often and does not have any future intent for any \nfurther alcohol-related issues. However, despite participating in the DUI program on two \noccasions; successfully completing at least one court-ordered outpatient alcohol \ncounseling program; and possibly completing a much longer outpatient counseling \nprogram, he continues to consume alcohol. In March 2023, he acknowledged that he \nconsumed one to two unidentified alcohol drinks in an average week and stated that he \nhad consumed alcohol as recently as a few days earlier. (Item 4 at 7) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns for Alcohol \nConsumption in AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \nOn two separate occasions in 2017 and 2021, after consuming alcohol and driving, \nApplicant was arrested by the state highway patrol and charged with (1) driving while \nunder the influence of any alcoholic beverage, and (2) driving while having a 0.08% or \nhigher blood alcohol, both misdemeanors. On both occasions, he was convicted of the \nsecond charge and the first charge was dismissed. AG \u00b6 25(a) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Alcohol Consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Despite two alcohol-related convictions \nand repeated court-ordered mandatory out-patient alcohol counseling over extended \nperiods, Applicant continues to consume alcohol, as recently as March 2023. As noted \nabove, he never acknowledged that he was a maladaptive alcohol user although he \nrecognized the fact that alcohol contributed to both incidents. At the time, he believed he \nwas fine to drive after drinking, and claimed that alcohol affects his behavior by making \nhim happier and more talkative. Merely claiming to have become more responsible by \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndrinking less because he now has a child does not constitute a \u201cclear and established \npattern of modified consumption.\u201d In addition, because Applicant failed to submit \ndocumentation to identify or describe the two programs or counseling reports to verify his \nparticipation in them, I am unable to review any program recommendations \u2013 especially \nas to modified consumption or abstinence \u2013 to determine if he has been fully compliant \nwith those recommendations. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s Alcohol Consumption is adopted herein. \nApplicant was arrested by the state highway patrol and charged with (1) driving while \nunder the influence of any alcoholic beverage, and (2) driving while having a 0.08% or \nhigher blood alcohol, both misdemeanors. On both occasions, he was convicted of the \nsecond charge and the first charge was dismissed. Based on the actions described \nabove, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) have been established. \nIn addition, his second conviction\u2019s sentence was imposed on September 7, 2022. \nAlthough in April 2023 he claimed that he had completed his 18-month court-ordered out-\npatient alcohol counseling program in March 2023, he offered no documentary evidence \nto verify his claim. He acknowledged that his fines were currently being paid. His 3-year \nprobation has not expired or otherwise been terminated, and as such, without verifying \ndocumentation to the contrary, it appears to be still in force until September 7, 2025. AG \n\u00b6 31(c) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Criminal Conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither condition applies. Appellant\u2019s criminal behavior occurred in April 2017 and \nreemerged again in April 2021 \u2013 four years apart. There is no evidence of criminal conduct \nsince April 2021 \u2013 a period of 31 months. The passage of such time without recurrence \nof criminal activity; compliance with the terms of probation; constructive community \nservice; modified alcohol consumption; and the successful completion of DUI schools, \nare generally considered to be positive factors. However, in this instance, it remains \nunclear if Applicant actually learned to modify his actions after undergoing repeated court-\nordered punishment and alcohol counseling, for he continues to consume alcohol. Also, \nbecause Applicant failed to submit documentation to identify or describe the two programs \nor counseling reports to verify his participation in them, I am unable to review any program \nrecommendations \u2013 especially as to modified consumption or abstinence \u2013 to determine \nif he has been fully compliant with those recommendations. Under these circumstances, \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case considering the totality of the record evidence \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 32-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as an aircraft mechanic with his \ncurrent employer since February 2020. He was previously employed as a grocery store \nstocker (May 2010 \u2013 March 2012). He is a 2009 high school graduate. He enlisted in the \nU.S. Navy in March 2012 and remained on active duty until February 2020, when he was \ndischarged as an E-5. He was granted a secret clearance in 2012. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. On two separate occasions in April 2017 and April 2021, after consuming \nalcohol and driving, Applicant was arrested by the state highway patrol and charged with \n(1) driving while under the influence of any alcoholic beverage, and (2) driving while \nhaving a 0.08% or higher blood alcohol, both misdemeanors. On both occasions, he was \nconvicted of the second charge and the first charge was dismissed. Despite those \nalcohol-related convictions and repeated court-ordered mandatory out-patient alcohol \ncounseling over extended periods, Applicant continues to consume alcohol, as recently \nas March 2023.  \nApplicant never acknowledged that he was a maladaptive alcohol user although \nhe recognized the fact that alcohol contributed to both incidents. At the time, he believed \nhe was fine to drive after drinking, and claimed that alcohol affects his behavior by making \nhim happier and more talkative. Because he failed to submit documentation to identify or \ndescribe the two programs or counseling reports to verify his participation in them, it is \ndifficult to review any program recommendations \u2013 especially as to modified consumption \nor abstinence \u2013 to determine if he has been fully compliant with those recommendations. \nIt remains unclear if he has fully complied with the terms of his second sentence or if his \nperiod of probation has been dismissed early. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. He is not married, but resides with his fianc\u00e9. He has \na Ph.D. in Engineering. \nHe currently holds the position of Senior Principal Antenna \nEngineer.

Her parents live in Iran. They \nhave received their permanent residency, and they come and visit the U.S. when they \nchoose. Her father is retired, but he was an Electrical Engineer working for an oil \ncompany in Iran. (Tr. p. 21.)

His parents and \nsister currently live in Iran. His brother lives in Finland, and is also a citizen of Australia. \n(Tr. p. 22.) Applicant\u2019s father is a retired lawyer. He later became \na University \nprofessor in Iran. He retired from teaching about seven or eight years ago. Applicant\u2019s \nmother was an elementary school teacher in Iran, before she retired about 20 years \nago. Applicant\u2019s sister was a Software Engineer in Iran, and she retired a few months \nago. She was working for a Government contactor. (Tr. p. 23.) Applicant does not \nknow the name of the agency or department she worked for. Applicant\u2019s brother is a \nmechanical engineer and currently works for a university in Finland as a researcher. \n(Tr. p. 24 and 25.) \nApplicant last traveled to Iran a few months ago. He has traveled in the past to \nIran on about an annual basis and he plans to continue to travel at least that much in \nthe future. (Tr. p. 31.) He continues to travel using his Iranian passport, and he plans \nto continue to maintain his foreign passport for traveling purposes. He has no plans to \nrelinquish his passport. (Tr. p. 27.) Applicant also stated that every time he travels \nback to Iran to visit his parents or friends, he never mentions anything about his work.  \n(Tr.p. 33.) \nApplicant stated that he recently applied for his parents to move to the U.S. They \nrecently received their green cards. He also applied for his sister to move to the U.S. \n(Tr. p. 32.) \nDuring his interview with an authorized investigator for the DoD, Applicant stated \nthat his ultimate allegiance lies with the United States. However, as a dual citizen of \nIran and the United States, he has the right to vote in Iranian elections and he plans to \nvote in future elections in Iran. (Government Exhibit 2, p. 3.) \nApplicant testified that his work product has been great. Despite the fact that the \nrecord remained open following the hearing to allow Applicant the opportunity to provide \ndocumentary support, and it was specifically stated that additional information would be \nhelpful in making a decision in this case, Applicant offered no submissions. \nNo \nperformance appraisals, and no letters of recommendation from management or others \nwho could attest to his credibility were submitted. Applicant also testified that his \nparents and sister had already applied for their green cards and were waiting for a \nresponse. Applicant had the opportunity to provide documentation to show what steps \nhis family in Iran have accomplished towards their goal, and he submitted nothing. \nI have taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the \nIslamic Republic of Iran. Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic \npolitical system. The supreme leader is the head of state and holds constitutional \nauthority over the judiciary, government-run media, and other key institutions. The U.S. \nDepartment of State travel advisory for Iran is Level 4: Do not travel to Iran due to risk \nof kidnapping, and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens \nvisiting or residing in Iran have been kidnapped, arrested, and detained on spurious \ncharges.

(HE-1.) \nThe Iranian government has taken few steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, \nand punish officials who committed human rights abuses or corruption. \nImpunity \nremained pervasive throughout all levels of the government and security forces. (HE-1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has close family ties and friends in Iran. Applicant\u2019s foreign family \nmembers include his mother, father, and sister, who are citizens and residents of Iran. \nApplicant maintains a very close relationship with his family in Iran. Although he has \napplied for them to come to the United States, this process may take some time to \naccomplish, if at all. He travels to Iran to visit his family and friends there on a regular \nbasis, and he plans to continue to do so in the future. He maintains his foreign Iranian \npassport, and has no intentions of relinquishing it. He also plans on voting in future \nIranian elections. \nBased upon the evidence presented, Applicant\u2019s foreign family members and his \nclose commitment to Iran do present a risk to national security. They may threaten or \ninfluence Applicant\u2019s choice of interest as a naturalized United States citizen. Under the \nparticular circumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is applicable, and this contact \nposes a security risk to the U.S. government that is not necessary. This unnecessary \nsecurity risk in not worth any benefit to the U.S. government. The nature of his very \nclose relationship with his family may manipulate or induce the Applicant to help a \nforeign person or government in a way that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests. \nThere is a heightened risk of foreign influence, or exploitation, or personal conflict of \ninterest from his foreign contacts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions.. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAlthough Applicant stated that no one in his family is associated with the Iranian \ngovernment, he continues to show some unusual allegiance to the country. Even as a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, he maintains his Iranian passport, and he plans to vote in future \nelections in Iran. This is very telling about his connection to the country, its people and \nhis family there. Given Applicant\u2019s current situation, Applicant is a naturalized U.S. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncitizen, and his close relationship with his foreign family members in Iran, present the \npossibility of a divided allegiance. Insufficient mitigation has been shown under AG \u00b6 \n8(a), 8(b), and 8(c). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nprovided no documentary evidence to support his testimony or corroborate his \nstatements. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the Foreign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINT APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He married in 2016 and \nhas no children. He was employed by a in the private sector from 2016 to November \n2021, when he was hired by a federal contractor. \nApplicant completed a National Security Questionnaire (SF 86) in June 2022.

He occasionally used it on his day off or on the \nweekends to relax and sleep. He estimated that during this period he used it between 30 \nand 50 times. He reported that he enjoyed the relaxing aspect of the drug but did not like \nthe impact it had on his motivation and drive. He was also hiding it from his wife at the \ntime, and that ruined any enjoyment or relaxation he gained from using it. He does not \nintend to use illegal drugs in the future. It was illegal where he was using it at the time. \n(GE 3) \nApplicant also disclosed on his SF 86 that from August 2021 to September 2021 \nhe used his wife\u2019s prescription of Flexeril, a muscle relaxant. He explained he injured his \nback while doing yard work and used two to three pills for several week of his wife\u2019s \nprescription that she did not intend to use. He used approximately 10-15 total pills. He \ndisclosed to the government investigator In July 2022, that he previously had his own \nprescription for the drug but ran out. In his SOR answer, he explained that although he \npreviously had a prescription for this drug, he understands the use of his wife\u2019s \nprescription was unacceptable. He has no intention to ever use this substance again \nwithout a valid prescription. (GE 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant disclosed on his SF 86 that in May 2022, he used two pills of his wife\u2019s \nprescription for Tramadol over a two-day period when his allergies were bad. He stated \nin his SOR answer that at one time he had a valid prescription for Tramadol for his \nallergies and migraines so was aware of its benefits, but he understood that his use of his \nwife\u2019s prescription was unacceptable. He has sought medical treatment for his severe \nallergies. He has no intention of ever use this substance again without a valid prescription. \n(GE 2, 3, 4) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana on various occasion from January 2019 to May 2019. \nHe misused the medications Tramadol without a valid prescription twice in May 2022 \nand Flexeril on various occasions between August 2021 and September 2021. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant disclosed his use of THC by vaping and his misuse of prescription drugs \non his June 2022 SF 86. He has not used THC since May 2019 because he did not like \nthe impact it had on his motivation and drive. He was also hiding it from his wife at the \ntime and that ruined any enjoyment. He indicated that at one time he had his own \nprescriptions for Flexeril and Tramadol but used his wife\u2019s prescription, rather than having \nhis own prescriptions renewed, when he had back problems and allergies symptoms. He \nhas no intention to ever use those substances again without a valid prescription. \nIt has been over four years since Applicant used THC. I considered the fact that \nhe self-disclosed all his drug use. Based on his assertions, I find that sufficient time has \npassed since his last drug use and it is unlikely he will use illegal drugs again in the future. \nI find that although he was familiar with both prescription drugs because he had his own \nprescriptions in the past, his misuse was wrong. He understands this was inappropriate \nand intends to follow proper procedures in the future. Both mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nno questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

The case was \nassigned to me on June 29, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on July 7, 2023. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on August 23, 2023. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 \nthrough 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. \nHe elected not to present any documentation. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on September 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 38-year-old process engineer with a defense contractor.

In \nhis responses to DOHA interrogatories he stated his marijuana use had ended in March \n2022. (Government Exhibit 2 at 20.) His testimony was very vague about the extent of \nhis marijuana use.

The evidence shows that Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms from \napproximately 2005 through January 2021. He has made several contradictory \nstatements about his mushroom use.

In his responses to DOHA \ninterrogatories he stated that his mushroom use was from 2006 to January 2021. \n(Government Exhibit 2 at 20.) His testimony was very vague about the extent of his \nmushroom use. He was very unsure about when it ended, stating it was possibly late \n2019, but could also be 2021. (Tr. 28-31.) \n1.c. Applicant admitted using cocaine one time in approximately August 2019. \nThis was before he started his current employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section \n23, Exhibit 2 at 11-12, 20; Tr. 31-33.) \n1.d. Applicant admitted using LSD one time in approximately August 2019. This \nwas before he started his current employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23, \nExhibit 2 at 11-12, 20; Tr. 31-33.) \n1.e. Applicant admitted that he had been charged with Possession of Cannabis in \napproximately July 2009. The case resulted in his paying a fine and serving probation \nfor a period of time. He continued to use marijuana for more than ten years after this \narrest. (Government Exhibit 2 at 9-10; Tr. 33-35.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, \nuntrustworthiness or unreliability. \n2.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that the Applicant\u2019s drug use \nhistory, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \nApplicant did not admit or deny this allegation. His silence is viewed as a denial. \n2.b.

They were married in 2008, and informally separated in \n2013. She lives in a different state from him. He is unsure of her immigration status, but \ndoes not believe she is a citizen of the United States. The couple have no plans to \ndivorce. (Government Exhibit 2 at 22-23.) \nThe SOR states that Applicant has remained married to his spouse to assist her \nin qualifying for U.S. citizenship through the naturalization process. In his Answer he \nstated, \u201cWe remain married. No reason not to be. Not for sole purpose of citizenship. \nAlso co-parenting child and family ties. No rule says I have to divorce someone I was \nwith 10 years.\u201d \nApplicant testified that he does not know his wife\u2019s current immigration status. \nThe most he would say is that she might \u201ctechnically be considered in the country \nillegally.\u201d Once again, his testimony was very vague as to his wife\u2019s citizenship status \nand despite questioning by Department Counsel and myself did not clarify it. (Tr. 15-25.) \nIt is noted that neither side presented any direct evidence as to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s \ncurrent immigration status. In addition, no evidence was presented by either side \nindicating why Applicant and his wife remaining married during the pendency of any \nnaturalization issue would be legally significant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be \nused in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana, often on a daily basis, from 2003 through at least \nJanuary 2022. He was arrested for a marijuana-related possession offense in 2009. He \nused mushrooms on a regular basis from 2005 through January 2021. He used cocaine \nand LSD a single time each in August 2019. Both of the stated disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nNone of the stated Mitigating Conditions apply to the facts of this case. Applicant \nhas an extensive history of using illegal drugs, particularly marijuana and mushrooms. \nAs stated, he was often unwilling or unable to state with any particularity when he \nstopped using drugs, except that it was several years after starting work with his current \nemployer. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when \nconsidered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules or regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n2.a. As stated under Paragraph 1, above, Applicant\u2019s drug use was frequent, and \ncontinued after he was employed. None of the Mitigating Conditions apply to his \nconduct in using illegal drugs. Subparagraph 2.a is found against Applicant. \n2.b. Applicant remains married to his wife, even though they have been \nseparated for ten years. The government alleges that he remains married to her to \nassist in her naturalization process. However, neither side presented any evidence \nabout her current immigration status, or how her marital status affects it. As Applicant \nsaid, there is no rule stating he has to get divorced. As the allegation and evidence \nstands, I find that there is insufficient evidence that Applicant is remaining married to his \nspouse for a nefarious or illegal purpose. Accordingly, this allegation fails to raise \nsecurity concerns. Subparagraph 2.b is found for Applicant. \nAs stated, subparagraph 2.a was found against Applicant. Accordingly, \nParagraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his extensive drug use, which continued after he gained \nemployment in the defense industry. Continuation or recurrence of similar conduct is \nlikely. Overall, the record evidence does create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

His admissions are \nincorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He has never married but he has an eight-year-old child. \nHe earned a certification as a pharmacy technician in 2014. He took classes at a trade \nschool from August 2014 to May 2015. He was employed in various jobs in the private \nsector from 2013 to October 2020. He was then unemployed until September 2021, when \nhe began his current job as an engineer with his clearance sponsor. His SCA reflects no \nprior security clearance. (Item 2) \nOn his SCA, Applicant disclosed a repossessed vehicle on a car loan he cosigned \nwith his mother, for which he owed about $12,000. (Item 2 at 28-29) He discussed that \ndebt, and others, in his April 2022 background interview. (Item 3) In September 2022, he \nwas given the opportunity to provide documentation to the DCSA CAS about what he was \ndoing about his various debts, but he did not provide any documents in his interrogatory \nresponse. (Item 4) \nThe SOR details 13 delinquent debts, totaling about $36,400. With one exception \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d), the debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by the credit bureau \nreports (CBRs) in the record, from March 2022, December 2022, and April 2023. (Items \n5, 6, 7). The SOR debts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($14,256) is the charged-off account relating to the repossessed car \nApplicant listed on his SCA. He cosigned the loan for his mother in April 2016 and she \nfell behind on payments. He has made no efforts to address this debt, leaving it to his \nmother to do so. (Items 3, 5, 6) The debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($6,678) is a charged-off auto account. Applicant cosigned a loan for a \nwoman he was dating. He said in his interview that he recognized the mistake he made \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin cosigning on the loan and would take care of the debt but provided no record of \npayments. (Item 3, 5, 7) The debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($2,197), 1.e ($1,244), and 1.k ($250) are federal student loans, \nalleged as past due. They are listed as past due on credit reports from March 2022 and \nDecember 2023 (Items 5, 6) Applicant indicated in his interrogatory response that the \naccounts were paid or being paid, though he provided no documentation. The accounts \nare listed as being in good standing in an April 2023 credit report. However, the \u201clast \npayment date\u201d is listed as being in February 2020. (Items 4, 7) Thus, it is likely that the \naccounts are in deferred payment status due to the COVID pandemic and not due to any \naction by Applicant. Applicant has not detailed any efforts to address his federal student \nloans. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($1,891) is a cell phone account placed for collection. Notwithstanding \nApplicant\u2019s admission to this debt in his SOR response, this account is not listed on any \ncredit report in the record, and it is not addressed in the interrogatory response to the \nCAS. (Items 4-7) I conclude that this debt was included in the SOR erroneously, likely \ndue to a clerical error. SOR \u00b6 1.d is found for Applicant.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,212) is a medical account placed for collection. (Item 5, 6) Applicant \nsaid that the bill relates to an ER visit in 2019. He said he was on his mother\u2019s insurance \nat the time and never received a bill. This debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g ($673), 1.h ($513) and 1.i ($307) are retail store credit card accounts \nplaced for collection by the issuing banks. (Items 3, 5, 6, 7) These accounts are \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($253) is an account placed for collection by a cable or internet provider. \n(Item 6) The debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($6,343) is an account placed for collection by the trade school where \nApplicant took classes from August 2014 to May 2015. (Items 3, 5) He said he dropped \nout when his girlfriend became pregnant. (Item 3) This debt is unresolved. \nApplicant reported in his interrogatory response that some of the debts have been \nor are being paid, but he provided no documentation. He provided a partial personal \nfinancial statement that suggested a net monthly income of about $4,400 and monthly \nexpenses of just over $2,000, leaving a significant remainder. However, he did not list \nany debts that he was addressing.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant incurred numerous past-due debts in recent years, related to his \neducation, car purchases, and some consumer and medical debts. The debts are \nestablished by the credit reports in the record, and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply to all SOR debts but for SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and unresolved. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant did not establish that his debts occurred due to circumstances beyond \nhis control. He did not establish that he has undertaken good-faith, reasonable action to \naddress his debts, and he has not established that they are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. He needs to establish a plan to resolve his debts and provide evidence of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcrete steps towards that plan including a track record of payments. He has not \nprovided any evidence of this to date. Applicant did not establish that any Guideline F \nmitigating condition should apply to mitigate the security concern shown by his delinquent \ndebts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Given the limited documentation in this case, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts. Since \nApplicant requested a decision on the written record, I did not have the opportunity to \nquestion him in a hearing about the status of his SOR debts, or to better assess the \nreasonableness of his actions in addressing them. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. This \ndoes not mean that Applicant cannot establish in the future that he is taking reasonable \nsteps to resolve his debts, but at this time, he has not shown that he has done enough to \nmitigate the Guideline F security concerns arising due to his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.l:  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:   \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.b., and 1.d.). He denied the remaining allegations with brief comments. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein.

When he was interviewed \nby an OPM investigator in March 2022, it was only after he was confronted with additional \ndelinquent accounts that he opened up about them as well. He disputed one account, \ndenied any knowledge of several delinquent accounts, and claimed to be unaware of \nother identified accounts. \nThe SOR alleged five still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $20,797, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is an automobile loan account with an unpaid balance of $12,259 that \nwas placed for collection when the vehicle was involuntarily repossessed in September \n2020 and eventually charged off. (Item 6 at 5; Item 5 at 2; Item 7 at 3-4) Applicant \nacknowledged that the account became delinquent when he lost his job, and he couldn\u2019t \nafford to continue his payments. He did not maintain any contacts with the creditor since \nthe repossession, and as of October 2022, had not made any arrangements to set up a \nrepayment plan. (Item 4 at 2) Applicant failed to submit any documentation to reflect any \npayments being made. The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a personal note loan-account with an unpaid balance of $2,791 that \nwas placed for collection after being over 60 days past due. (Item 6 at 6; Item 5 at 2) \nApplicant claimed that in January 2021 he agreed to a payment arrangement under which \nhe would pay the creditor $150 per month, but he failed to submit either to the OPM \ninvestigator or to DOHA any verifying documentation. (Item 4 at 2; Item 7 at 4) In the \nabsence of such documentation, there is no evidence to support Applicant\u2019s claim \nregarding any negotiations, agreements, or payments being made. The account has not \nbeen resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. is a medical account with an unpaid balance of $309 that was placed \nfor collection. (Item 6 at 6; Item 5 at 2) Applicant claimed the account had been satisfied \nin 2015 but the creditor failed to confirm that it had been paid. As a result, he disputed it \nrepeatedly in 2016, 2018, 2019, and again in 2020. (Item 7 at 4) As of October 2022, he \nhad not made any efforts to resolve the confusion stemming from the dispute. (Item 4 at \n3) Applicant failed to submit any documentation to reflect any payments having been \nmade.

He reported \n$500 in bank savings and a car worth $10,000. (Item 4 at 8) None of the SOR-related \ndelinquent accounts are listed as intended recipients of any monthly payments. (Item 4 \nat 8) Nevertheless, there is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems \nare now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially than he had been, considering his $20,797 in unresolved delinquent \ndebts. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged five still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $20,797. \nApplicant attributed his inability to maintain the largest of those accounts in a current \nstatus to his period of brief unemployment (September 2019 - January 2020) which led to \na strain on his finances, without furnishing any details about that situation and how it \nnegatively impacted him. During his March 2022 OPM interview, he indicated he would \nstart resolving all the delinquent accounts in 2022. In his October 2022 Personal Financial \nStatement, he reported $1,114.02 as a monthly remainder available for savings or \nspending. Nevertheless, despite his available funds and his stated intentions, he did not \nsubmit any documentation to indicate that he had made any efforts to pay any of the five \naccounts alleged. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. Because of Applicant\u2019s \navailable monthly remainder, it appears that as of October 2022, he had the ability to start \naddressing his delinquent accounts but chose not to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has also been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nWhile AG \u00b6 20(b) had some minor impact on Applicant\u2019s financial situation, he had \nsubstantial opportunities to start resolving his delinquent accounts once he was once \nagain employed in January 2020, but he chose not to do so. None of the other conditions \napply. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). It appears that Applicant simply decided to ignore his \ndebts and walk away from them without making any verifiable meaningful resolution \nefforts. Instead, he initially denied the existence of some of those delinquent debts, \nclaiming he was unaware of them, or that he had already resolved them. However, when \nconfronted with the 2022 undisputable credit report evidence of their existence, he \ndiscussed his intention to start repayment negotiations during the remainder of 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR indicates two of his delinquent debts are in charged-off status on \nhis credit reports. A \u201ccharged-off debt\u201d is an accounting entry. A creditor considers a debt \nowed to the creditor to be an asset. When the value of the asset is in doubt, the creditor \nis required to change the status of the debt to reflect its current status. When the debt \nappears to be uncollectible, the creditor should change the status for accounting purposes \nfrom being an asset to charged-off status. Notwithstanding the change to charged-off \nstatus, a creditor may still sell the debt to a collection agent, and the debtor may still pay \nor settle the debt. Eventually, the charged-off debts will be dropped from the debtor\u2019s \ncredit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped off his [or her] credit report is not \nmeaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, \n2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit \nReporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven \nyears from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because \nof a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer.

Because of his failure to \nconfirm payment of even his smallest delinquent accounts (a $259 medical account and \na $309 medical account) and his failure to furnish documentation regarding any of the \naccounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems \nare not under control. He has not acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent \naccounts while employed and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with his \ncreditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018)) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any verifiable evidence that he has even begun making such \nefforts even after the SOR was issued in March 2023. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered no specifics \nregarding any repayment plan; submitted no documentary evidence to reflect any \npayments made; and only made promises of possible proposed actions. Not one \ndelinquent debt has been resolved. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \ngeneral failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them even after substantial \ninvestigatory action was taken, is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were \nnot infrequent. The timeliness of his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, and the delay \nin commencing to do so, is another negative factor. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current (as of October \n2022) financial information. Applicant\u2019s non-existent actions under the circumstances cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. \n09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case considering the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v.

Nevertheless, despite his available funds and his stated intentions, he did not \nsubmit any documentation to indicate that he had made any efforts to pay any of the five \naccounts alleged.  \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to confirm payment of even his smallest delinquent \naccounts and his failure to furnish documentation regarding any of the accounts, the \noverwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems are not under \ncontrol. By failing to address his delinquent accounts while employed and by failing to \nmake limited, if any, efforts of working with his creditors, he has not acted responsibly. \nThere are lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than \nhe had been, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, and the \nlengthy period of non-contact with his creditors, is negative and disappointing. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations. See \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) electronically on \nNovember 2, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. He did not address SOR \u00b6 2.a in his Answer. After identifying the discrepancy and \nnoting this was a cross allegation of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, he admitted the allegation. (Tr. \nat 9.) Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old security guard employed by a defense contractor since \nFebruary 2022. He is required to carry a firearm for his position and is licensed to carry \nthe firearm by his state. He has never held a security clearance. He has never married \nand has two sons, ages 10 and 3. He is the custodial parent for his youngest son. He is \none of eleven children and is the first of his brothers and sisters to earn a college degree. \nHe earned his bachelor\u2019s in business administration in 2017 from an out of state \nuniversity. While attending the university he played football for the university. (Tr. 16, 28.) \nIn March 2018, Applicant, was charged with possession of marijuana after a night \nout with friends. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) He was pulled over by a police officer for a turn on yellow \nand the police officer observed a baggie of marijuana on Applicant\u2019s passenger seat. The \npolice conducted a formal search of the car and found no other inculpatory evidence. \nApplicant testified and stated in his statement that the marijuana was not his and had \nbeen left by the passenger, a relative, he had just dropped off. He accepted responsibility \nfor the possession because he was the only occupant of the car. (Tr. at 21, 31.) He told \nthe officer he did not smoke marijuana and reiterated he does not use marijuana and \ndoes not associate with people who do. He does not associate with that relative anymore. \nHe has passed several random drug tests as part of the diversion program he was placed \nin to resolve his offense. (GE 1; Tr. at 22, 29, 30, 31.) \nIn February 2019, Applicant was charged with fleeing a law enforcement officer \nand reckless handling of a firearm. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) He was a passenger in a car driven by \nhis younger brother when the incident occurred. His brother has a criminal record. His \nbrother was pulled over by the police for vehicle infractions. The police officer informed \nhis brother he was a suspect in a shooting and asked if there were any firearms in the \nvehicle. His brother had a handgun in the glovebox and because of his criminal record \nhis brother drove away from the police for a short distance. Applicant took the gun from \nthe glovebox and ran from the police. He tossed the gun into some bushes just before he \nsurrendered himself. The police located the gun in the bushes.

At the hearing, he admitted he told the officers he thought he was being pursued \nfor a child support arrearage as an excuse for his actions. (Tr. at 24-26, 39.) Without \nhesitation during his testimony, Applicant said he made that up and was not thinking of \nthe consequences of his actions. (Tr. at 38.) He testified the officers were familiar with his \nfamily because of other incidents and that he had been a well-known football player at his \nhigh school. The police were aware he had just come home from school and that he would \nnot have been involved in the shooting. He explained he had spent time working with the \npolice doing community services and they were instrumental in getting his charges nolle \nprosequi. (Tr. at 25, 26, 37, 41, 42.) \nApplicant testified his actions were mistakes due to youth. He now avoids the \nsiblings who have troubled histories and is close with other siblings. One of his siblings is \nalso a security guard at the same site. He said that his life four years later is completely \ndifferent. He is focused on work and taking care of his kids. (Tr. at 37, 39, 41.) When \nasked whether he had any additional traffic violations since his security clearance \ninterview, he responded no. (Tr at 47-48; GE 5.) \nApplicant\u2019s character letters captured the qualities he demonstrated during the \nhearing, a direct and candid person who acknowledged without hesitation his mistakes. \nA retired law enforcement officer and education administrator both applied their vast \nexperiences dealing with young men in describing why they were offering their favorable \nreferences for this Applicant. His present colleagues espoused their strong and favorable \nopinions of Applicant\u2019s work and his character. (AE A - AE G.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was charged with fleeing from a law enforcement \nofficer and reckless handling of a firearm in February 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he was \ncharged in March 2018 with possession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 31(a) is established. The two law enforcement events between 2018 and \n2019 cast doubt on the Applicant's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness AG \u00b6 32(b) \nis established by his arrests and admission. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is established for the charges. The first prong of AG \u00b6 32(a) focuses \non whether the criminal conduct was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining \nwhen conduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \nevidence. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). If the evidence \nshows a significant period has passed without any evidence of misconduct, then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates changed \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. Id. \nSufficient time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior. \nDuring this time Applicant has changed his lifestyle by disassociating himself from \nhis family members who have a troubled history, making similar circumstances unlikely \nto recur. When these events occurred, he was just out of college and had not had a \nchance to establish himself in life or the workforce. The disposition of the 2019 offenses \nby nolle prosequi, his present employment, and positive family situation reflect these were \nisolated and unusual incidents in his life. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is established. Applicant was remorseful, candid, and credible at the \nhearing. He readily acknowledged his mistakes. He has adjusted his lifestyle, avoids \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npotentially compromising situations, and focuses on his family. His youngest son, who was \nborn after these incidents, lives with him. Raising his son has helped him recognize how he \nneeded to change his life to be a good father to both of his sons. His character letters reflect \nhis ability to rise above all circumstances. He is now working in a position of responsibility \nand is authorized to carry a firearm. He testified credibly that he has several siblings who \nare on his path and who he continues to associate with and maintain close ties to while \ndisassociating himself from siblings and acquaintances who have criminal involvement. \nHis decisions reflect he is applying his education, maintaining a high work ethic, and \nmaking necessary behavioral changes in his life. After carefully considering all the \nevidence, I am satisfied that Applicant is rehabilitated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under \nthis guideline. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \nI have considered whether the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline are applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under\nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established by the evidence. \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d) is not applicable. Applicant\u2019s conduct was explicitly covered under \nGuideline J. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established. Applicant\u2019s conduct and initial responses when confronted \nabout his criminal conduct could adversely affect his personal, professional, and \ncommunity standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt \nupon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \n32(a). \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) are established. Applicant\u2019s acknowledgment of his criminal \nbehavior, his outstanding performance as an employee of a defense contractor, as well \nas the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG 32(a) mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 17(g) is established. Applicant no longer associates with persons involved in \ncriminal activity. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised under Guidelines J and E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Not enough time has elapsed since he engaged in alcohol-related criminal \nbehavior to show that future misconduct is unlikely to recur. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n  Statement of the Case \nOn February 2, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) \nand J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD \non June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DCSA CAS did not find under the Directive \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines G and J. \nApplicant provided an undated response to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (SOR response). The case was assigned to me on June \n28, 2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non September 15, 2023, setting the hearing for October 12, 2023. The Microsoft Teams \nvideo-teleconference hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4. Applicant testified but did not offer any documents. The Government\u2019s \nproffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. I held the record open \nfor two weeks in the event either party wanted to supplement the record with additional \ndocumentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 19, 2023. No post-\nhearing documentation was submitted, and the record closed on October 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all allegations contained in the SOR.

(SOR \u00b6 2.a) (Tr. 21-27; GE 1, \nGE 2, GE 3) \nRegarding the December 2021 incident, Applicant testified that he had consumed \napproximately four glasses of wine and believed he was fully capable of driving himself \nhome. He was crossing over the lanes on the two-lane road and was pulled over by police. \nHis breathalyzer test registered 0.12%. He was not required to participate in an alcohol \ntreatment program, but he does have to submit to alcohol screenings when he reports to \nhis probation officer, and he could get a random alcohol screen test at his home. His \ndriver\u2019s license was revoked for 18 months. He has complied with his sentence \nrequirements, and he expects that he may be released early from probation in April 2025. \nHis attendance for reporting to his probation officer is perfect, and his alcohol screenings \nhave all been negative. He is required to remain abstinent from alcohol while serving on \nprobation. Applicant stated he would be willing to submit supporting documentation while \nthe record was held open, but he did not do so. (Tr. 21-27, 32) \nApplicant testified that he has not consumed any alcohol for approximately the last \nyear-and-a-half. He stays focused on work and stays busy. During his April 2022 \nbackground interview, he told the authorized DOD investigator that it would take four or \nfive mixed drinks to get intoxicated, and he would get intoxicated one or two times a \nmonth. After his second alcohol-related arrest, he changed his drinking pattern. He was \ncurrently drinking once a month at home, and he would only drink two alcoholic \nbeverages. During the hearing, Applicant stated that he would only drink alcohol for \nspecial occasions during the time following his arrest and court disposition, such as \nholidays and birthdays. After he was placed on probation in September 2022, he has \nmaintained full sobriety. (Tr. 25-27; 31-34) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 22 provides two conditions that could potentially raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other\nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol\nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;\nand \n \n \n \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). Applicant was involved in \ntwo alcohol-related arrests in 2019 and 2021, and his breathalyzer recordings were well \nover the legal limit, registering 0.14% and 0.12%. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol arrests are recent. During his April 2022 background \ninterview, he admitted that he reduced his consumption of alcohol following his second \narrest in December 2021, but he still continued to drink alcohol. It was not until he was \nordered by the court to abstain from alcohol when he finally made the decision to stop \ndrinking altogether. He has not participated in alcohol counseling or treatment. As of the \ndate of his hearing, he is still on probation from his December 2021 arrest and conviction. \nHe has not yet established a commitment to abstain or to use alcohol in moderation once \nhis probation expires in 2025. Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating clear \nevidence of successful rehabilitation. I conclude that the potentially mitigating conditions \ndo not apply, and the alcohol consumption security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two potentially apply: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be\nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in\ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness; and \n \n \n \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c). Applicant was involved in \ntwo alcohol-related arrests in 2019 and 2021, and he is currently serving on probation \nfrom his most recent offense until September 2025. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct raises serious security concerns. His recent alcohol-\nrelated arrests and his probation requirement to abstain from using alcohol until \nSeptember 2025 shows that the court found his repeated criminal conduct concerning \nand his alcohol consumption warranted monitoring. He had a serious lapse in judgment \nwhen he was arrested a second time for driving under the influence of alcohol. Because \nhe is still on probation, he cannot demonstrate clear evidence of rehabilitation. Not \nenough time has elapsed since he engaged in alcohol-related criminal behavior to show \nthat future misconduct is unlikely to recur. As such, his criminal behavior continues to cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant failed to establish \nmitigation under the above mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J into my whole-person analysis. \nThe court sentenced Applicant to three years of probation, through September \n2025. Despite his claimed compliance with his probation and some demonstrated \nrehabilitative progress, it is still too soon to make the necessary safe predictive judgments \nabout the absence of any recurrent alcohol risks or criminal behavior. More time is \nrequired before Applicant can be considered successfully rehabilitated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 26 years old. She is not married but cohabitates with her boyfriend.\nShe has no children. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and a master\u2019s degree in \n2020. She works for a defense contractor and completed a security clearance application \n(SCA) in July 2022.  \n \nApplicant disclosed in her SCA that she started using marijuana when she was a \nfreshman in high school in about June 2013. She stated: \nStarted experimenting with THC my freshman year of high school. Everyone \nin my friend group smoked THC regularly at the time. In college[,] my \nboyfriend at the time smoked THC everyday due to his chronic anxiety. I \ndated him for four years and would join him at night before bed 4-5 times a \nweek. \n \nSince I started using THC at 15 years old, I am unable to know the number \nof times I used THC. The nature of use was casual usually in a friend setting \nat night or on the weekends. When I graduated college at [X] State \nUniversity my friend group drastically changed since I moved to [State A], \nand I did not use THC for at about 1 year and 3 months.

This was late at night and at her \napartment complex.  \n \nI do not intend to use THC in the future because I believe it to be a bad habit \nof my past that is a part of my rebellious teenage years that has lingered in \nmy life far too long. THC is not important to me and my memories \nsurrounding it are a mix of very bad and very good experiences neither \noutweighing the other. (Item 2) \nApplicant disclosed that she purchased THC from roommates and friends that \nshe associated with in high school and lived with in college. She said she did not need \nto purchase it often because her friends, boyfriend, or roommates always had it around. \nHowever, when she did purchase it, it was never more than 1-3.5 grams.

(Item 2) \nApplicant further disclosed in her SCA other illegal drugs she used. She stated: \u201cI \nhave experimented with mushrooms exactly four times.\u201d (Item 2) She noted the dates \nwere from October 2019 to March 2022. She explained the nature of her use as follows: \nI have experimented with mushroom exactly four times. The first time was \nwith my roommate in college. We had nothing to do one night, and she \nasked me if I wanted to try them. I got sick, threw them up and nothing \nhappened. The second was at my friend\u2019s birthday party on July 4th, 2021. \nThere was a small group of six[,] four of us, four of which tried mushrooms \nwhile we kayaked down a river in [State C]. The third time was with a friend \nin graduate school at [University]. He had been wanting to try them for a \nwhile and I had told him about my experience. We tried them at my \napartment then took a short walk at a trail near my apartment complex. The \nfourth was with the same friend 2 weeks later. We still had some from the \nlast time and used them at my apartment. We did not go anywhere this time. \n(Item 2) \nRegarding whether Applicant intended to use hallucinogenic mushrooms in the \nfuture she stated: \nMushrooms make me want to throw up every time I have used them. Also, \nthey feel no different from having a beer or two in my experience. There is \nno real point in using them in my opinion. (Item 2) \nApplicant disclosed that when she used mushrooms in March 2022 that she and a \nfriend purchased them to share. She said: \u201cI have only purchased mushrooms once[,] any \nother time I have tried them they were given to me.\u201d (Item 2) She further stated: \u201cMy friend \nhad never tried them before and asked me if I would be able to get them for us. I knew \nsomeone who sold them, so we split the cost.\u201d (Item 2)   \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in October 2022. She told \nthe investigator that when she initially tried marijuana as a freshman in high school in \nJune 2013 that she did not start using it regularly until 2015. She would smoke marijuana \nabout once a month in backyards of friends\u2019 houses from 2015 to 2016. From 2016 to \n2020, she vaped or ate edibles almost daily at friends\u2019 houses. From 2020 until July 2022, \nshe would consume marijuana through vape or edibles twice a year on average. She \npurchased her drugs on occasion and it was freely provided at other times. She believed \nher drug use was immature, and she used it for social reasons. She told the investigator \nthat she no longer socializes with anyone who uses drug illegally. She disclosed friends \nwith whom she used drugs. She said she stopped smoking marijuana in July 2022 \nbecause she felt like she had outgrown that phase of her life.

In March 2022, \nshe and her friend used mushrooms together and two weeks later used them again. She \npurchased the mushrooms. She did not believe her actions of using mushrooms was due \nto immaturity, but rather she used them for social reason. She listed her friends who are \naware of her drug use, including her current boyfriend, and she revealed that at least two \nof the people she listed used drugs with her in the past. (Item 3) \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM. It is unknown if her boyfriend, \nwith whom she cohabitates, uses illegal drugs. It is unknown whether she continued \nabstaining from using marijuana since she completed her SCA in July 2022. \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility \ndetermination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used THC with varying frequency from about June 2013 until July 2022. \nShe used hallucinogenic mushrooms on four occasions between October 2019 and \nMarch 2022. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used THC with varying frequency from the 2013 to July 2022, the same \nmonth she completed her SCA. She stated that she used it in high school with her friends \nwho smoked it regularly and then four to five times a week with her boyfriend while in \ncollege. She said she did not use it for a period after graduating from college, but then \nvisited a friend who used THC, so she joined him. She attributed her use of THC to \nimmaturity, social reasons, and being a rebellious teenage. Perhaps being immature is \ntrue, but she continued to use it after graduating from college and again in July 2022 \nshortly before completing her SCA. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s use of hallucinogenic mushrooms, she said she first used \nthem in college and again at a friend\u2019s birthday party in 2021. In March 2022, another \nfriend wanted to use them, so she purchased mushrooms for them to use, and they used \nthem together on two occasions. She did not believe her actions of using mushrooms was \ndue to immaturity, but rather she attributed her actions to social reasons. I am not sure \nexactly what that means but presumably she used them when she was in social settings \nor due to peer pressure. \nApplicant stated in her SCA that she has abstained from THC use and does not \nintend to use it in the future. She also said she did not see the point in using mushrooms \nbecause she can get the same experience from consuming beer. \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM or any additional evidence on \nwhether she has continued to abstain from illegal drug use. I was unable to make a \ncredibility determination of Applicant\u2019s sincerity and commitment to future illegal drug use. \nApplicant told the government investigator that she no longer socializes with people who \nuse illegal drugs. I am not convinced that is the case, as she listed friends who are aware \nof her drug use and would not blackmail her. Some of these people are ones with whom \nshe used illegal drugs. I was unable to determine if she no longer associates with these \npeople or if she has changed her environment. I was unable to determine if her boyfriend \nuses THC or any illegal drugs. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant\u2019s conduct was infrequent, happened \nunder unique circumstances, and is unlikely to recur. Not enough time has passed to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconclude future drug use is unlikely. Without additional evidence, I find her illegal drug \nuse casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) \nand 25(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Tr. 42; SOR response at 2) Her September 13, 2022 \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) summary states that in response to a question \nabout her future marijuana use, Applicant said, \u201c[She] intends to smoke marijuana on a \nrare occasion.\u201d (Tr. 40; GE 2 at 4) Applicant said her comment to the OPM investigator \nwas misconstrued and misunderstood, and the summary should have said in the past she \nsmoked marijuana on a rare occasion. (Tr. 40) She used marijuana on September 10, \n2022, which was one week before her OPM interview. (Tr. 41; SOR response at 2) She \nonly took one puff on the marijuana cigarette, and she instantly regretted her marijuana \nuse. (Tr. 42) The person who gave her the marijuana left the state where she lives. (Tr. \n41) She disclosed the September 2022 marijuana use to the OPM investigator. (GE 2) \nApplicant did not use any illegal drugs after September 2022. (Tr. 42) She ended \nher relationship and associations with persons who she knows to be marijuana users. (Tr. \n42-43) The only illegal drug she has used is marijuana. (Tr. 43) \nApplicant \u201cprovid[ed] a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d (GE 2 at 14) \nApplicant emphasized that she voluntarily reported her involvement with \nmarijuana; her marijuana use is not recent; her marijuana use was not a pattern; she did \nnot have any drug paraphernalia; and she does not intend to use marijuana in the future. \n(Tr. 44-45) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant provided nine character statements including from a project leader, \nforeman, former supervisor, facility security officer, and other coworkers. (AE B) The \ngeneral sense of her character statements is that Applicant is diligent, friendly, family \noriented, dedicated, and innovative. (Id.) She contributes to the successes of her \nemployers. A physician assistant who has treated her for ten years indicated she is not \naddicted to marijuana; she is psychologically stable; and her marijuana use was very \nlimited and primarily when she was a teenager. (AE C) Her character evidence supports \napproval of her access to classified information. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988).

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). AG \n\u00b6 25(g) is not established because Applicant said she did not express an intention to use \nmarijuana in the future to the OPM investigator. Moreover, the SOR does not allege she \nintended to use marijuana in the future. Information not alleged in the SOR will not be \nconsidered for disqualification purposes. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nFact \nSheet \nMarijuana/Cannabis \nat \nhttps://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Marijuana-Cannabis-2020 0.pdf. (HE 4) \nSee also Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on \nSchedule I). \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges and Applicant admitted that she used and purchased marijuana \nwith varying frequency from about July 2005 to about September 2022. Her decision to \nrepeatedly possess and use marijuana is an indication she lacks the qualities expected \nof those with access to national secrets. She candidly said she used marijuana after \ncompletion of her SCA and grant of an interim security clearance. She used marijuana \nabout 11 months before her security clearance hearing. She had prior periods of \nabstinence from marijuana possession and use from 2013 to 2016 and from 2020 to 2022. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. She voluntarily disclosed \nher marijuana possession and use during the security clearance process. She disclosed \nher marijuana use on her SCA, during her OPM interview, in her SOR response, and \nduring her hearing. She promised to refrain from future marijuana involvement. She \nprovided evidence of actions taken to overcome her marijuana involvement. She \ndisassociated from drug-using associates and contacts. She changed or avoided the \nenvironment where drugs were used. She provided a signed statement of intent to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nI am not convinced Applicant\u2019s marijuana possession and use \u201chappened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). Her marijuana involvement in \nSeptember 2022 continues to \u201ccast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] \ngood judgment.\u201d (Id.) Her marijuana use is relatively recent, and she has not established \na sufficient pattern of abstention from marijuana use. I have lingering concerns that she \nwill use marijuana or violate security rules in the future. Guideline H security concerns are \nnot mitigated at this time. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old building operations controller, who has been employed \nby a government contractor since December 2022. In 2013, she received her GED. In \n2015, she received an associate degree of science specializing in automotive mechanics. \nApplicant provided seven character statements from coworkers. The general \nsense of her character statements is that Applicant is diligent, friendly, family oriented, \ndedicated, and innovative. She contributes to the successes of her employers. A \nphysician assistant who has treated her for ten years said she is not addicted to \nmarijuana; she is psychologically stable; her marijuana use was very limited; and it \noccurred primarily when she was a teenager. Her character evidence supports approval \nof her access to classified information. \nApplicant candidly discussed her history of involvement with marijuana throughout \nthe security clearance process. Her descriptions of her marijuana involvement were \ngenerally consistent. Her marijuana involvement was not discovered through law \nenforcement or security investigations. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nApplicant admitted that she possessed and used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout July 2005 to about September 2022. Her decisions to repeatedly possess and use \nmarijuana is an indication she lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national \nsecrets. She candidly said she used marijuana after completion of her SCA and grant of \nan interim security clearance. She used marijuana about 11 months before her security \nclearance hearing. \nAn honest and candid self-report of marijuana use is an important indication that, \nif granted security clearance eligibility, applicant would disclose any threats to national \nsecurity, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career \nor personal reputation. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

More time without marijuana involvement is \nnecessary to establish a pattern of abstinence and rule-following behavior. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both \ndisqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under her current circumstances, \na clearance is not warranted.

The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 17, 2023, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on June 27, \n2023.

Items 2 through 6 are \nadmitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on August 23, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. His admission is incorporated into the \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 27 years old. He graduated from college in 2019. He is not married \nand has no children. He began working for his present employer, a federal contractor, in \nNovember 2021. (Item 4) \nIn December 2021, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Non-sensitive \nPosition (SF 85). Section 14 asked if in the last year he had used, possessed, supplied, \nor manufactured illegal drugs in the past year. He responded \u201cNo.\u201d The section advised, \n\u201cNeither your truthful response nor information derived from your response will be used \nas evidence against you in any subsequent criminal proceeding.\u201d (Item 5) \nIn May 2022, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Position \n(SF 86). Under Section 23-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, it states with reference \nto this section that neither your truthful responses nor information derived from your \nresponses to this section will be used as evidence against you in a subsequent criminal \nproceeding. (Item 4) \nSection 23 asked if in the last seven years Applicant had illegally used drugs. He \nresponded \u201cNo.\u201d In the section titled: \u201cAdditional comments\u201d there were none. He certified \nthat his responses in the SF 86 were true, complete, and correct to the best of his \nknowledge and belief and were made in good faith. He further affirmed that making a \nknowing and willful false statement was punishable under federal law. He affirmed that \nhe understood that intentionally withholding, misrepresenting, or falsifying, or including \nclassified information may have a negative effect on his security clearance, employment \nprospects, or job status, up to and including denial or revocation of a security clearance, \nor removal and debarment from Federal service. \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator under oath in July 2022. \nWhen asked if he had used any illegal drugs in the past seven years, he admitted using \nmarijuana in 2015 and again in 2019. When questioned as to why he did not disclose his \ndrug use, he explained he was worried about what would happen if he listed his marijuana \nuse. He said he did not know what would happen with his employment if he answered the \nquestion honestly, so he lied. \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in March 2023. In them, he \naffirmed the accuracy of July 2022 background interview and said the reason he did not \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisclose his marijuana use because: \u201cThis was my first government job, and I was \nscared/unsure what would happen.\u201d (Item 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2023 answer to the SOR, he stated he wanted to explain his \nconduct. He said he was nervous about the security process and had no idea how it \nworked, especially being a new employee for a big company. He stated, \nI was scared of what would happen if I put \u201cyes\u201d on the e-quip for having \ndone any drugs since I didn\u2019t know if I was going to be rejected \nautomatically, arrested, fired, taken out of the building by people in suits, or \nhave a stain on my record. One that I have spent my entire life building. I \nalso didn\u2019t want to be painted with the same broad stroke brush as someone \nwho does all kinds of drugs constantly or sells them. That isn\u2019t me, never \nhas, and never will.\u201d  \nI received advice from a peer suggesting that I could answer \u201cno\u201d and \nexplain in more detail during the interview. While this seemed like a \nreasonable approach at the time, and I did go into that detail in my interview, \nI now realize that it was not the best course of action. (Item 2) \nApplicant further explained in his SOR answer that he recently learned that his \ncompany has people that help employees through the security process. He believed he \ngot terrible advice and should have answered the question with a \u201cyes.\u201d He stated, \u201cI wish \nI had known that during the time, but I was so new at the company and was overwhelmed \nby all of the paperwork.\u201d (Item 2) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant stated that he is committed to upholding the highest \nstandards of integrity and honesty in his work and he understands the importance of \nmaintaining a spotless record in order to hold a position of trust. He recognizes the \nseriousness of the clearance process and the importance of complete transparency and \nhonesty. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted and the evidence supports that he deliberately failed to disclose \nhis past drug use on his SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security process. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide information, the individual cooperated \nfully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nThe evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6 17(a). There is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that Applicant made a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his \nomission. He did not disclose his past drug use until he was asked about any prior drug \nuse by the government investigator during his background investigation. \nApplicant told the government investigator that he did not disclose his past drug \nuse because he was concerned about the potential impact on his job. He reiterated this \nexplanation later when he answered government interrogatories. Neither time did he \nmention that he received bad advice from a friend who told him to respond \u201cno\u201d to the \nsecurity question and provide his explanation to the investigator later. He had an \nopportunity to provide an explanation or clarifying information in the additional comments \nsection of the SF 86 and did not. Clearly, if he consulted with a friend about how to answer \nquestions on his SF 86, he could have easily asked those in his company with expertise \nin the process. He did not. AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply. \nBeing truthful and honest is the cornerstone of the security clearance process. \nAlthough the paperwork involved may be daunting and perhaps having guidance of how \nto proceed may be helpful, no one should need guidance on the requirement to tell the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntruth. It is the simplest part of the process. The answer to any question that Applicant may \nhave asked an expert in the process regarding how to respond to questions on his SF 86, \nis always, be honest. One should not need guidance on the requirement to tell the truth. \nThe government relies on those who are trusted with the nation\u2019s secrets to always be \nhonest, even when disclosure could potentially threaten one\u2019s career. National security \nalways trumps one\u2019s personal considerations. Applicant deliberately chose to be \nuntruthful. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because deliberately failing to disclose information \non a SF 86 and swearing to its accuracy is not a minor offense. I find Applicant\u2019s \nomissions are serious and cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 26 years old. He is not married and has no children. He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Aerospace Engineering with an emphasis in Astronautics. He holds the position of Systems Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse Guideline E - Personal Conduct The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Applicant graduated from college with his Bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2021. After graduating, he obtained a job working with the military. He applied for and was granted a security clearance in April 2021. He continued working for the military from August 2, 2021, to June 20, 2022. Wanting a new working environment, he applied for and was hired by a defense contractor in June 2022. At that time, he applied for a higher level clearance which was granted in July 2022. (Tr. p. 31.) Applicant has a ten-year history of illegal drug involvement, including the use and purchase of MDMA (ecstasy), LSD, and marijuana on various occasions from about 2012 until at least 2022. Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Applicant used marijuana daily, almost every week from 2012 u",

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 20, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 26 years old. He is not married and has no children. He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree in Aerospace Engineering with an emphasis in Astronautics. He \nholds the position of Systems Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant graduated from college with his Bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2021. After \ngraduating, he obtained a job working with the military. He applied for and was granted \na security clearance in April 2021. He continued working for the military from August 2, \n2021, to June 20, 2022. Wanting a new working environment, he applied for and was \nhired by a defense contractor in June 2022. At that time, he applied for a higher level \nclearance which was granted in July 2022.  (Tr. p. 31.) \nApplicant has a ten-year history of illegal drug involvement, including the use and \npurchase of MDMA (ecstasy), LSD, and marijuana on various occasions from about \n2012 until at least 2022. Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth in the \nSOR. Applicant used marijuana daily, almost every week from 2012 until May 2021. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) He used marijuana after applying for a security clearance, while \npossessing a security clearance, and while working in a sensitive position. Applicant \ntestified that from January 2022 to February 2023, he used marijuana four times. (Tr. p. \n29.) \nApplicant explained that he started smoking marijuana during his freshman year \nin high school because he got mixed up with the wrong crowd of friends. He explained \nthat his best friend suffers from Chrons Disease and the use of marijuana has helped \nhim with his condition. They have used marijuana together. Applicant testified that he \nlast used marijuana in February 2023. (Tr. p. 21.) He stated that he has now stopped \nusing marijuana, but that he still had friends and family that use it. (Tr. p. 22.) Applicant \ndid not report his illegal use of marijuana to his company security office. \nApplicant further admitted that he has also used illegal mind-altering substances \nsuch as MDMA (ecstasy) on 13 separate occasions, and LSD on six separate \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \noccasions, during the period from 2012 until at least January 2022. (Tr. pp. 26-27.) \nThe last time he used MDMA was on February 12, 2023. (Tr. 27.) Applicant explained \nthat on this occasion when he used MDMA, he was trying to enjoy himself with a \nprevious girlfriend who suggested that he use it to help him open up to his emotions. At \nthe time, Applicant was working for a defense contractor, possessed a security \nclearance, and held a sensitive position. Applicant knew that the use of this drug was \nillegal, that it was against company security policies, and against Department of \nDefense security clearance regulations. (Tr. p. 28.) \nApplicant completed a second Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing dated April 26, 2021. Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, \nIllegal Use of Drugs or Controlled Substances, asked, \u201cIn the last seven years have you \nillegally used any drugs or controlled substances?\u201d \nApplicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) This was a false answer. Applicant deliberately failed to \ndisclose his use and purchase of illegal drugs discussed above. \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing \ndated July 5, 2022. Section 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, Illegal Use of \nDrugs or Controlled Substances, asked, \u201cIn the last seven years have you illegally used \nany drugs or controlled substances? And, while possessing a security clearance have \nyou ever illegally used or otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance \nwhile possessing a security clearance other than previously listed?\u201d \nApplicant \nanswered, \u201cNO,\u201d to both questions. (Government Exhibit 1.) Applicant answered both \nquestions falsely. He deliberately failed to disclose his use and purchase of illegal \ndrugs discussed above. \nApplicant stated that he lied in response to the questions on both of his security \nclearance applications concerning his illegal drug involvement because he was worried \nabout how he would be perceived. He was afraid to reveal the truth. Drug use was \nsomething that he was not open with anyone about, including his parents and his \ngrandfather. He kept his drug use to himself, and he did not tell his family, friends, or \nemployers about it. (Tr. p. 31-32.) \nApplicant\u2019s year end performance reviews from his manager for 2022, and his \nmid-year review for 2023, reflect that Applicant has been an excellent performer. He is \nconsidered to be a key team member. His leads can rely on his work and product \ndeliveries to the higher management. He has demonstrated high ethics, reliability, and \nresponsibilities in his leadership skills by taking ownership of his tasks immediately. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B and C.) \nLetters of recommendation from team members of the Applicant attest to his \nreliability, dependability, and respectful character. He is a hard worker with a positive \nattitude who is always willing to help others despite being busy with his own work. He \nproduces high quality, consistent, and rule-compliant work. \nHe is well-liked and \nconsidered to be an excellent engineer.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the whole-person concept. \nThe administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. \nApplicant deliberately used \nmarijuana and MDMA (ecstasy) while possessing a security clearance and while \nworking in a sensitive position, which is against security rules and regulations and \nFederal law. Applicant last used marijuana and MDMA in February 2023, just nine \nmonths ago. He states that he is no longer using illegal drugs. His actions are not \nmitigated. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes.  Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and   \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant deliberately lied on two of his security clearance applications \nconcerning his use and purchase of illegal drugs, as he did not want the Government to \nknow the true extent of his illegal drug involvement. His attempt to conceal this material \ninformation from the Government on these forms shows immaturity, poor judgment, \nunreliability and untrustworthiness. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant did not follow the rules. Instead, \nhe chose to live his life to his convenience, and disregarded the law. Applicant used \nillegal substances while possessing a security clearance and while employed in a \nsensitive position. He also deliberately lied about his illegal drug use on two security \nclearance applications in an attempt to conceal this information from the Government. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct has been immature, irresponsible, and is inappropriate behavior, \nthat shows poor judgment. Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant does not \nshow the maturity level, integrity, and reliability necessary to access classified \ninformation. At this time, Applicant does not meet the eligibility qualifications for a \nsecurity clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified information. \nApplicant understands the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand knows that illegal drug use is not tolerated. Applicant is not an individual in whom \nthe Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant does not \nmeet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a. and 2.b. \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August 17, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with explanations. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in approximately June 2023. He works in the information technology \n(IT) career field. He has an associate degree. He is married for the second time and has \nthree children from this marriage. (Tr. 6, 12-13, 27, 30; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed nine delinquent accounts (personal loans, \ncredit cards, delinquencies from vehicle repossessions, and consumer debts) totaling \napproximately $85,000. The debts are established by credit reports from August 2022 \nand April 2023; Appellant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u2013 \n1.i). (Tr. 19, 32, 39-44; GE 3-4; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted all the SOR debts during his testimony. He also admitted that \nhe has not made any payments toward any of the debts as of the date of the hearing. \nHe stated that the reason for his financial difficulties was because his wife was involved \nin a near-fatal car accident in November 2016. Before the accident, she had a full-time \njob, but afterward she was unable to work. She collected short-term disability payments \nfrom her employer for some time, but eventually had to utilize the Family and Medical \nLeave Act (FMLA). This put her in a non-pay status for an extended period of time. She \nhas never gone back to work, preferring instead to be a stay-at-home mother with their \nchildren. (Tr. 13, 15, 31-32, 35-36, 39-44) \nBecause of the accident, Applicant\u2019s wife incurred approximately $100,000 worth \nof medical bills not covered by insurance. In order to support his household without his \nwife\u2019s income, Applicant began using credit cards and obtaining personal loans. He was \nunable to make regular payments on them so he consulted with a bankruptcy attorney. \nHe was advised by the attorney to stop paying his creditors and file for bankruptcy, \npreferably under Chapter 13. He stopped paying his debts in early 2018. Applicant \ntestified because of the pandemic and delays by his attorney, a bankruptcy petition was \nnever filed. Upon further contact with his bankruptcy attorney, it was suggested that \nsince many of the debts had \u201cfallen off\u201d his credit report because of being over aged, \nthat Applicant could continue with this course of action. A bankruptcy filing would \nresurrect the delinquent debts and Applicant chose not to have that happen. (Tr. 16-17; \nGE 4) \nIn August 2017, Applicant sold his home and received proceeds of approximately \n$35,000. He used these proceeds to pay non-SOR loans from family and friends that \ntotaled approximately $40,000. None of these proceeds were used to pay any SOR \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebt. At some point, Applicant\u2019s wife inherited approximately $35,000 from her father\u2019s \nestate. None of these funds were used to pay any SOR debt. In May 2019, Applicant\u2019s \nwife settled the lawsuit that resulted from her car accident. She received approximately \n$100,000 from the settlement. Applicant testified that the entire amount went to pay \ntheir attorney and to the unpaid medical bills. No supporting documentation was offered. \nNone of this amount went to pay any SOR debt. (Tr. 14-15, 33, 35-36, 46-49) \nApplicant testified that the credit cards and lines of credit taken out were \nsupposed to be in his wife\u2019s name only. His credit reports show that he is named either \nas a joint debtor or the individual debtor on all the SOR debts. He failed to present \ndocumentary evidence to the contrary. (Tr. 53; GE 3-4) \nApplicant\u2019s current financial picture shows that he has approximately $600 as a \nmonthly residual after paying his current expenses. He does not use a formal budget. \nHe has approximately $9,000 in savings and $30,000 in a retirement account. He and \nhis family live in his deceased mother\u2019s house, which is owned by a family trust. He \ndoes not have a monthly home or rent payment. He owns two cars that are fully paid. \nHe presented no evidence of financial counseling, other than his discussion with his \nbankruptcy attorney. (Tr. 36-37, 48, 51) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts, which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. He made a conscious decision not to file for bankruptcy to avoid \nresurrecting charged-off debt. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and he admitted that he has not paid or resolved \nthem. He failed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is \nunlikely. He made a conscious choice not to address his delinquent debts, rather he \ndecided to allow them to age off his credit report. While this decision may be a sound \nfinancial decision, it does nothing to show his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment for security worthiness purposes. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s unfortunate car accident and resulting medical debts without \ninsurance are conditions beyond his control. However, by failing to address his SOR \ndebts in any manner he has not acted responsibly. He admittedly weighed the benefit of \npursuing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but decided against this action when he learned this \nwould resurrect some of his aged-off delinquent accounts. He pursued no other \npayment options. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAside from his contact with a bankruptcy attorney, Applicant did not present \nevidence of financial counseling. He failed to establish good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndebts. Given the unpaid status of his debts and the lack of a responsible plan to resolve \nthem, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) \ndo not apply. Applicant admitted the SOR debts and did not document that the accounts \nwere solely his wife\u2019s responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s car accident, and the circumstances surrounding \nhis indebtedness. However, I also considered that he has made insufficient efforts to \nresolve his debts. He has not established a meaningful track record of financial \nresponsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 6, 9-11) In 2002, he graduated \nfrom high school. (Tr. 7) In 2006, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in business \nadministration with majors in marketing and management of human resources.

(Tr. 9)  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom about September 2001 to about February 2022. He used marijuana three to five \ntimes a week at the time he completed his March 14, 2022 SCA. (Tr. 32) From 2011 to \n2022, he used marijuana about 500 times. (Tr. 27) He purchases marijuana in a state \nwhere possession and use are legal. (Tr. 36, 39-40; GE 1) Applicant uses a vape and \nedibles to consume marijuana. (Tr. 30, 33) He most recently used marijuana on August \n5, 2023, which was five days before his hearing. (Tr. 33) He uses marijuana to help relieve \nstress. (Tr. 35) He believes marijuana use should be an \u201cinalienable right\u201d because the \nbenefits of marijuana use far outweigh the negatives. (Tr. 41) He acknowledged \nmarijuana possession was illegal under federal law. (Tr. 42)  \nApplicant was honest about his marijuana involvement.

(Tr. 48) Even if he receives a \nsecurity clearance, he would probably continue to use marijuana. (Tr. 48) \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to allege that Applicant used \nmarijuana from February 2022 to at least August 5, 2023. (Tr. 34) Applicant did not object, \nand I granted the motion. (Tr. 34) \nApplicant did not believe his marijuana use was relevant in a determination of his \ntrustworthiness. (Tr. 19) His marijuana use cannot be used to coerce or bribe him to obtain \nclassified or sensitive information. (Tr. 19-20, 23) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5\n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nPossession of a Schedule I controlled substance is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nFact \nSheet \nMarijuana/Cannabis \nat \nhttps://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2020-06/Marijuana-Cannabis-2020 0.pdf. (HE 4) \nSee also Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on \nSchedule I). On October 2022, President Biden announced that he asked the Attorney \nGeneral to review whether marijuana should remain as a Schedule I controlled substance. \n(AE C) There is some support in the federal government to move marijuana from Schedule \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI to Schedule III. (AE D) Schedule III controlled substances are less addictive and \ndangerous than Schedule I controlled substances. President Biden announced additional \nremedies for persons convicted of simple possession of marijuana. (Id.) President Biden \nsaid: \nAs I often said during my campaign for President, no one should be in jail \njust for using or possessing marijuana. Sending people to prison for \npossessing marijuana has upended too many lives and incarcerated people \nfor conduct that many states no longer prohibit. Criminal records for \nmarijuana possession have also imposed needless barriers to employment, \nhousing, and educational opportunities. (AE C) \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant used marijuana about 500 times from 2011 to 2023. He knew his \nmarijuana possession or use or both was prohibited by federal law. He used marijuana \nfive days before his hearing, and he said he intended to use marijuana in the future. His \ndecision to repeatedly possess and use marijuana is an indication he lacks the qualities \nexpected of those with access to national secrets. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed \nhis marijuana possession and use during the security clearance process.

He is likely to continue to use marijuana \nin the future. Guideline H security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline H are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old corporate officer for a company, which provides highly \ntechnical engineering products and services to DOD. In 2006, he was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree of business administration with majors in marketing and management \nof human resources. In 2010, he was awarded an MBA. In 2016, he was awarded a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering technologies, and in 2020, he received an \nassociate degree in applied science. \nApplicant discussed his history of involvement with marijuana on his SCA, in his \nSOR response, and at his hearing. His marijuana involvement was not discovered \nthrough law enforcement or security investigations. He did not test positive on a urinalysis \ntest, and he does not have any drug-related arrests. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nApplicant used marijuana about 500 times from 2011 to 2023. He received clear notice in \nthe SOR that use of marijuana was incompatible with holding a security clearance.

Applicant was candid and honest about his history of \nmarijuana possession and use. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement and substance \nmisuse security concerns. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under his current \ncircumstances, a clearance is not warranted. In the future, he may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his security worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in November 2000, and he \nreceived a medical discharge in March 2002. He earned a professional certification in \n2013. He was previously married in 2007 and divorced in 2013. He married his current \nwife in 2019. He has one adult son.

Applicant currently possesses a DOD security \nclearance that was issued in December 2020. (Tr. 16, 20; GE 1, GE 2; AE C) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2022 SCA, he did not disclose any illegal drug use. SOR \u00b6 \n1.a alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from September 1996 \nto March 2023. In his Answer, Applicant stated that he used marijuana in high school, \nbut he did not use any marijuana while he served in the U.S. Navy. In 2012, he ruptured \nhis Achilles tendon which required surgery. He was prescribed Lortab and Oxycodone \nfor pain management. He did not feel comfortable taking the prescribed narcotics, so he \nchose marijuana instead to treat his pain from 2012-2015. In 2016 he ruptured his left \nAchilles tendon, and although he was not required to have surgery, he again chose to \nuse marijuana to manage his pain. After the pain went away, he used marijuana to treat \nsymptoms of depression. In 2018, his state of residence legalized marijuana, and he \nobtained a medical marijuana card to continue to treat his depression and his post-\ntraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). (GE 1; Answer) \nApplicant testified that he applied for a permanent position with his employer in \nJanuary 2021. He had previously worked for this employer as a temporary employee, \nand he was aware that he would be required to take a drug test to be offered a \npermanent position. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that in February 2021, Applicant tested positive \nfor marijuana during a drug test given by his employer. An incident report disclosing a \npositive drug test was filed on Applicant in March 2021. In the SOR Answer, he \nadmitted he had used marijuana during the holidays due to depression and not working. \nHe had informed the federal contractor that he would test positive during the drug test \ndue to his medical marijuana use.

He continued to \npurchase marijuana to treat his symptoms from another state he had moved to in 2020 \nthat had also legalized marijuana use for recreational purposes. According to his \nAnswer, he could not have obtained a medical marijuana card in 2012 since his state of \nresidence did not legalize medicinal use of marijuana until 2018. (Tr. 19-27; Answer) \nApplicant also provided conflicting information when he testified that he was \ncompletely unaware that marijuana use was illegal under federal law, and therefore \nincompatible with a federal government contractor employee possessing a DOD \nsecurity clearance. He did not learn that this was an issue until March 2023, when he \nreceived an interrogatory from DOHA. In his interrogatory response he listed that he last \nused marijuana in March 2023, and he intended to use marijuana in the future. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c) The SOR was also issued in March 2023, and in his Answer, he denied that he \nintended to use marijuana in the future. He had no intentions of using marijuana as long \nas it could have an adverse effect on his employment with a federal contractor. (Tr. 27-\n28; GE 3; Answer) \nIn August 2022, Applicant participated in a background interview with an \nauthorized DOD investigator. Applicant was asked if he had used any illegal drugs or \nmisused prescription drugs within the last seven years, which Applicant denied. He was \nthen confronted with the March 2021 incident report of his positive drug test. He told the \ninvestigator that he was prescribed medical marijuana in 2012 after surgery to manage \nhis pain. He ended his medicinal use of marijuana in 2015, but he continued to maintain \nhis medical marijuana card in case he would need marijuana for pain in an emergency. \nHe told the investigator that he moved his family to another state in 2020, and he used \nmarijuana \u201ca few times\u201d due to lifting and carrying heavy items. He last used marijuana \nin March 2020, and he had reported this to the federal contractor when he was required \nto undergo a drug test in February 2021. He was aware of a co-worker under \ninvestigation for illegal drug use, and he had no intent to use marijuana unless it \nbecame legal under federal law. Applicant read the investigative report, and in his \nMarch 2023 interrogatory, he certified that the information was accurate. The \ninformation he provided during his August 2022 background interview is inconsistent \nwith information he provided in his Answer and during his testimony. (GE 3) \nApplicant provided two character reference letters from a co-worker and his wife. \nThey described Applicant as dedicated and responsible. Although neither mentioned \nApplicant\u2019s recent use of marijuana, they held no reservations about Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter or loyalty.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence reflect that Applicant used \nmarijuana from September 1996 to March 2023. He tested positive for marijuana during \na drug test in February 2021, and despite holding a DOD security clearance since \nDecember 2020, he continued to use marijuana while holding a sensitive position.

As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has a long history of using \nmarijuana, and his last use occurred in March 2023. He provided inconsistent \ninformation during his background interview, in his Answer, and during his testimony. \nHe is not considered to be a credible witness. He did disclose that he intended to use \nmarijuana in the future in his March 2023 interrogatory response. After he received the \nSOR that same month, he stated that he no longer intended to use marijuana if his job \nwas in peril. I do not find his statement to be dependable or convincing. He failed to \nabstain from marijuana involvement despite acknowledging during his background \ninterview that doing so was in violation of federal law and in contravention of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrequirements for security clearance holders. Overall, his use of illegal substances while \npossessing a security clearance continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement \nand substance misuse security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on him to establish mitigation. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nAfter considering the record as a whole, to include Applicant\u2019s military service \nand the circumstances surrounding his use of marijuana to treat chronic pain and other \nvarying symptoms, I conclude that Applicant has not met his heavy burden of proof and \npersuasion due to the recency of his last use of marijuana while holding a DOD security \nclearance. His decision to use marijuana despite knowing he was violating federal law \nand security regulations continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. It was only after he realized that \nhis employment position was in jeopardy that he decided to abstain from using \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nmarijuana. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an  \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines guidelines are flexible \nrules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the whole-\nperson concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance, and possession of it is regulated \nby the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844. In an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum, the Director of National Intelligence affirmed that the use of marijuana is \na security concern. James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including\u2026purchase\u2026; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d alleged Applicant\u2019s pattern of using marijuana from May \n2016 to at least June 2019. The SOR also alleged three instances when she tested \npositive for marijuana use, in May 2016, May 2019, and June 2019. It also alleged that \nfrom May 2016 to June 2019, she used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. \nAnd finally it alleged that in June 2016, she was subjected to non-judicial punishment and \nfound guilty of Wrongful Use of Marijuana-Detected by Urinalysis. Her punished included \na reduction in rank, extra duty, and restriction for 45 days. Applicant unequivocally \nadmitted those allegations. \nFacts admitted by an applicant in an Answer to a SOR require s no further proof \nfrom the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App. Bd.

More specifically, the Board interpreted \u201cany illegal drug \nuse while granted access to classified information.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022), the Appeal Board held: \nEligibility for access to classified information and the granting of access to \nclassified material are not synonymous concepts. They are separate \ndeterminations. The issuance of a security clearance is a determination \nthat an individual is eligible for access to classified national security \ninformation up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone \ndoes not grant an individual access to classified materials. In order to \ngain access to specific classified materials, an individual must have \nnot only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also must have signed \na nondisclosure agreement [NDA] and have a \u201cneed to know\u201d [NTK]. \nSee Executive Order 13526, dated December 29, 2009, at \u00a7 4.1. While \nan eligibility determination is generally made at the agency level and is \nsubject to various regulatory due process requirements, an access \ndetermination is most often made at the local level without any due \nprocess guarantees. See also ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2023 (applying the foregoing to a \u201csensitive position\u201d). \nThe Board\u2019s holding is that eligibility for access to classified information is not \nenough to establish AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation.\u201d There is nothing in the record showing that Applicant signed a NDA and \nhad a NTK, or any substantially similar evidence granting access to classified information. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 25(f) has not been established. \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant\u2019s marijuana use has been mitigated, The \nfollowing four mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26: for drug involvement and substance \nabuse may potentially apply.: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges . . . her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence . . . ; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified medical professional. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a). On this record, Applicant\u2019s use \nof marijuana began in May 2016. That is quite a while ago. It continued, however, at least \nuntil she was discharged from the Army in June 2019. Her three positive drug tests suggest \nthat her use while in the Army was not infrequent. I find that AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply to \nher marijuana use while in the Army. \nI have carefully reviewed the record and compared it to the plain language of AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 26(b) through (d). It is clear that the record does not contain facts that support those \nother three mitigating conditions. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and an applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and \n(d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for \npersonal conduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d A statement or omission is false or dishonest when it is made \ndeliberately (knowingly and willfully). \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose her \nJune 2016 non-judicial punishment in her December 3, 2021 SCA. The SOR also alleged \nthat she falsified facts by failing to disclose in her December 3, 2021 SCA her use of \nmarijuana from May 2016 to June 2019 while possessing a security clearance. She \nunequivocally admitted both allegations. Her omission of those relevant facts falls \nsquarely within AG \u00b6 16(a), which states in pertinent part: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) states in pertinent part the only mitigating condition that might mitigate \nthat disqualifying condition: \n[The] individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana use three times while in the Army. She \ncould have \u2013 and should have - admitted that drug use in her December 3, 2021 SCA. \nBut she did not. Having reviewed the entire record, there are no facts that would support \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 17(a). Nor are there any other mitigating conditions that apply \nhere. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reason, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse, and \nGuideline E, personal conduct. \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):    \n  Against Applicant \n \n \n     Subparagraph 1.a: \n \n \n \n              Against Applicant  \n \n \n      Subparagraph 1.b: \n \n \n \n \n    For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.f: \n \n \n \n     Against Applicant \n \n \n \n \n   \nParagraph 2, (Personal Conduct)  \n  Against Applicant \n \n                 Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \n \n \n                 Against Applicant  \n \n \n                                 \nParagraph 3 (Criminal Conduct)       \n  Withdrawn \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n    \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nWithdrawn \n7 \n\nPhilip J.

(Items 4-6) \nIn about April 2022, after Applicant certified the SF 86, but before his first security \ninterview, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony menacing with a deadly \nweapon. He was also the subject of a protective order related to this incident. The \nalleged victim reported that, while their cars were stopped close to one another in a \nparking lot, she saw Applicant reach behind his car seat to retrieve something and got \nout of his car with a black, semi-automatic style handgun by his side while staring at \nher. She and her two children were inside their car. She claimed that she was so afraid \nafter seeing the gun that she \u201cblacked out\u201d and was in fear for her life. She backed her \ncar up and drove away from the scene. She told police that she was 100 percent sure \nthat Applicant was the individual holding the handgun. When the alleged victim\u2019s spouse \nconfronted Applicant about the incident, Applicant denied brandishing a weapon, but \ncommented that he considered everyone in the area a threat. The alleged victim\u2019s \nspouse did not witness Applicant holding a gun. (Items 5, 7) \nApplicant claimed that the alleged victim had nearly caused an accident involving \nboth their vehicles and that he had gotten out of his car, stood beside it, put his hands \nup, displayed his middle finger, got back in his car, and went on his way. He denied that \nhe brandished a firearm. He claimed that he had a firearm in a case in his car, but he \nleft it there. He claimed that his phone was in his hand when he got out of the car and \nthe alleged victim must have mistaken his phone for a firearm. When the alleged victim \nprovided her statement to police, the description of the firearm that she provided was \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the unloaded firearm that police later found in his car in a hardcase \nbehind his driver\u2019s seat. The case containing the weapon was placed on top of other \nitems. Applicant matched the description that the alleged victim provided to police. She \nalso picked him out of a police lineup. When Applicant was arrested, he spent part of a \nweekend in jail, but claimed that he was released the next business day without having \nto post bail. In June 2022, these charges were dismissed because, based upon recently \nobtained evidence/witness testimony, there was no longer a reasonable likelihood of \nsuccess at trial. In June 2022, the court vacated the protective order. (Items 5, 7) \nApplicant did not divulge this arrest during his May 2022 security interview \ndespite the investigator asking him about any issues involving the police that were \nrequired to be listed. The Government did not allege this failure to disclose in the SOR. \nAny adverse information not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification \npurposes, however it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; in \nevaluating \nan \napplicant\u2019s \nevidence \nof \nextenuation, \nmitigation, \nor \nchanged \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). \nDuring a November 2022 security interview, when an investigator asked \nApplicant why he did not divulge the April 2022 arrest during his May 2022 security \ninterview, he provided several reasons. First, contrary to the report of the May 2022 \nsubject interview that he certified, he claimed that the first investigator did not ask about \nincidents involving the police. He claimed that he would have reported the arrest if he \nhad been asked. He also claimed that he thought the incident was outside of the scope \nof the investigation because it happened after he submitted his SF 86. Finally, he \nclaimed that he did not report it because he did not think it affected his ability to do his \njob. (Items 5, 7) \nApplicant had two separate incidents where he was alleged to have had \npossession of a firearm where it was inappropriate for him to do so. On both occasions, \nhe acknowledged that he had access to a firearm that he kept in his car. On one of \nthese occasions a witness corroborated the actual location from which he collected the \nfirearm and the type of firearm that he acknowledged owning. On both occasions, he \nused the same explanation that the people who saw the firearm must have mistaken it \nfor something else he had in his hand. He was less than candid about the reasons for \nhis employment termination in his SF 86 and about his felony arrest during his May \n2022 security interview. During his November 2022 security interview, his explanations \nfor not divulging his felony arrest during his earlier interview were either inconsistent \nwith the evidence or illogical. I find it implausible that on two separate occasions, he \nwas unfortunate enough to be seen holding a firearm to which he had ready access. \nGiven these considerations, I find the evidence supports that he brought a firearm into \nhis workplace, and that he brandished a firearm during the April 2022 incident where he \nwas arrested. (Items 4-7) \nApplicant listed his supervisor as the only person with knowledge of his \ntermination. He listed one other person as having knowledge of his 2022 arrest.

(Items 4-7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s incidents involving bringing a firearm into his workplace in 2021 and \nbrandishing a firearm during a dispute in 2022 reflect questionable judgment, \nunreliability, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and \n16(d) are not perfectly applicable to his 2022 arrest because the underlying conduct is \nexplicitly covered under the criminal conduct guideline and may be sufficient for an \nadverse determination thereunder. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15, 16(c) and 16(d) are established by that conduct. For these reasons, his employment \ntermination for bringing a firearm into his workplace in 2021 also establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 15, \n16(c), and 16(d). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nTwice in the last two years, Applicant has shown poor judgment by possessing or \nbrandishing a firearm inappropriately. The most recent time was only about a year-and\u00ad\na-half ago, and I cannot find that it is unlikely to recur. Being careless or reckless with a \nfirearm is not a minor incident as it can result in serious injury or death. He has not \nprovided evidence that he has undergone counseling or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the causes of this unreliable and inappropriate behavior. As very few people \nknow about these incidents, and no one from his current workplace does, he has not \nprovided sufficient evidence that he has reduced vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. While he claims that he did not engage in the underlying \nactivity that led to his termination and arrest, for the aforementioned reasons, I believe \nthe information related thereto is both substantiated and reliable. None of the Guideline \nE mitigating factors apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. I found that corroborating evidence, his \nunlikely explanations, and his lack of candor during the clearance process provided \nevidence of disqualification and undermined his efforts at mitigation. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Some facts cannot be verified because he told multiple versions of facts and events. 1 Applicant is a 38-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor sponsoring him for a security clearance. He was born in a foreign country. He worked for a defense contractor in Iraq before he immigrated to the United States in 2008. Since then, he has worked for several defense contractors, sometimes overseas. He became a U.S. citizen in 2015. He held a security clearance in the past, but it lapsed when he was no longer employed by his sponsor. He has attended several colleges and universities, earning an associate degree from one of the colleges in about 2015. He married in about 2018 and divorced in about 2020 or 2021. He has one child.

He reported that he attended three colleges or universities between 2010 and 2015, and that he received an associate degree from the last university in November 2015. When he was interviewed for his background investigation in November 2018, he reported that he married a foreign citizen in a foreign country a few weeks earlier.

He \nbecame a U.S. citizen in 2015. He held a security clearance in the past, but it lapsed \nwhen he was no longer employed by his sponsor. He has attended several colleges and \nuniversities, earning an associate degree from one of the colleges in about 2015. He \nmarried in about 2018 and divorced in about 2020 or 2021. He has one child. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 18, 31, 48, 58-64, 75-76; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nFebruary 2018. He reported that he attended three colleges or universities between \n2010 and 2015, and that he received an associate degree from the last university in \nNovember 2015. When he was interviewed for his background investigation in \nNovember 2018, he reported that he married a foreign citizen in a foreign country a few \nweeks earlier. (GE 2, 3) \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor (DC1) from July 2017 to September \n2017. He was rehired by DC1 in February 2020, and he resigned for personal reasons \nin March 2020. He was rehired again in November 2020. (Tr. at 16; GE 6) \nDC1 reported that Applicant traveled to a foreign country for about five days in \nFebruary 2021 while he was on COVID-exposure quarantine. He then returned to work \nthe day after he arrived back in the United States, \u201cwhich was a violation of [DC1] \nAttestation policy.\u201d DC1 security representatives discovered that Applicant did not report \nforeign family members and foreign travel on his pre-screening questionnaire (PSQ) \nthat he submitted in December 2020. They conducted a travel debrief with him. He \nstated that his recent foreign travel was related to a request by a \u201cdistant cousin\u201d to sign \na medical release form so that she could undergo a medical procedure. During his \nbackground interview in November 2022, Applicant stated that he went to the foreign \ncountry to give his divorce papers to his ex-wife. (Tr. at 17-26, 30; GE 3, 4) \nApplicant testified that he had to go to the foreign country for a \u201cfamily \nemergency\u201d because his cousin, who he referred to as his sister, required surgery, and \nhe also had to serve divorce papers on his ex-wife. He stated he did not know that, as a \nclearance holder, he had to inform his employer that he was traveling to another \ncountry. He was on COVID hold during that period, and he was not reporting to work. \nHe stated that he thought it was acceptable to report the foreign travel upon his return, \nwhich is what he did. (Tr. at 18-26) \nApplicant was on a leave of absence from DC1 from March 2021 to the \nbeginning of June 2021. He worked in Afghanistan for another defense contractor (DC2) \nfrom about March 2021 to June 2021. He worked for DC2 in Africa for about two weeks \nin September 2021. DC1 security representatives interviewed him upon his return to \nwork in June 2021. He was asked if he had any foreign travel since his last trip in \nFebruary 2021.

(Tr. at 64) \nApplicant reported on the SF 86 that he was born in a foreign country, came to \nthe United States in 2008, and became a U.S. citizen in 2015. He inaccurately \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked: \u201cHave you EVER been issued a passport (or \nidentity card for travel) by a country other than the U.S?\u201d He denied that the answer was \nintentionally false. He stated that he did not think about his expired passport when \nanswering the question. He testified that his mother has renewed his foreign passport \nwithout his knowledge, but he did not learn that fact until after he submitted the SF 86. \n(Tr. at 45-54, 68-69; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \nApplicant reported on the SF 86 that he attended five colleges or universities \nbetween 2010 and 2022. He reported that he earned five associate degrees, including \nfrom two colleges in August 2012 and December 2012. He testified that was a mistake, \nand he did not have degrees from those colleges. He stated that he completed the SF \n86 in a rush, and he did not look back at his answers. (Tr. at 57-59; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1) \nOn the SF 86, under Section 13A \u2013 Employment Activities, Applicant failed to \nreport his work for DC2 from about March 2021 to June 2021 and again in September \n2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for \nApplicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2022 SF 86 when he \nfalsely reported the reason for leaving his employment with DC1 as \u201cwork ended due to \nCOVID-19,\u201d when in fact, he had been terminated from that job. His explanation that he \nanswered that way because he was on hold due to COVID-19 is nonsensical. This was \nnot a mistake nor an unintentional omission, it was a deliberately false statement. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is applicable. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally failed to report on the SF 86 his \nemployment with DC2 in March 2021 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and (again in September 2021 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e), He provided inconsistent reasons for the answer. He stated he forgot about the \nemployment, and he thought he did not have to report that employment because he \n\u201cwas doing a government service.\u201d He also indicated that \u201cit was a short amount of time \nand [he] thought it wasn\u2019t important.\u201d His explanations are not credible. I find he \nintentionally falsified the question. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nApplicant did not divulge either employment with DC2, which is why there are two \nSOR allegations, but he only falsified one question. I am consolidating the two \nallegations into SOR \u00b6 1.d by adding the following language to SOR \u00b6 1.d: \u201cand from on \nor about September 1, 2021 to on or about September 15, 2021.\u201d I am therefore \nconcluding SOR \u00b6 1.e for Applicant, since it is now covered in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleged that Applicant intentionally falsified Section 13C of the SF 86. \nThe SOR alleged the wrong question. Any adverse information about his employment \nwith DC1 was required to be placed in Section 13A, not 13C. His answer to 13C was \ncorrect. SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2022 SF 86 when he \nfailed to report that he had a been issued a foreign passport in 2011. I am not convinced \nby substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally falsified this question by failing to \nreport his expired passport. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable to that matter. SOR \u00b6 1.g is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nApplicant testified that his mother has renewed his foreign passport without his \nknowledge, but he did not learn that fact until after he submitted the SF 86. There is no \nevidence to counter that testimony, and the SOR only alleged the failure to report the \n2011 passport. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified the 2022 SF 86 when he \nfalsely reported that he had earned associate degrees from colleges in August 2012 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.h) and December 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). He testified that he made a mistake; he \ncompleted the SF 86 in a rush; and he did not look back at his answers. His \nexplanations are not credible. This was not a matter of glossing over a question or \nclicking the wrong button. He had to physically type the information in. I find he \nintentionally falsified the question. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.j \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges that Applicant intentionally failed to report his marriage from \n2018 to 2020 on the 2022 SF 86. He stated that he did not report his marriage because \nhe was divorced, and he did not realize he had to report previous marriages. He added, \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t get married in the church or mosques, so maybe that\u2019s probably why. It was \njust family arrangement. It\u2019s a civil - - I don\u2019t know.\u201d He later added, \u201cAnd then the \nmarriage part, it was just because I knew the lady was never going to come here.\u201d I am \nconvinced by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally falsified this question. AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant was dishonest to his employer and on his SF 86. Additionally, having \ndetermined that he intentionally provided false information in an attempt to mislead the \ngovernment, I have also determined that his testimony about those statements was also \nfalse. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.2 \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E my whole-person analysis. Most importantly, Applicant \ncannot be trusted to tell the truth. \n2 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nAgainst \nApplicant \n(with \nthe \nadditional language \u201cand from on \nor about September 1, 2021 to on \nor about September 15, 2021\u201d \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant (consolidated into \nsubparagraph 1.d) \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The DOD \nacted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the \nDOD Personnel Security Program (PSP), effective on April 3, 2017 (DOD Manual \n5200.02); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn September 9, 2022, Applicant submitted a response to the SOR.

On October 14, 2022, the DOD CAS denied \nor revoked Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information and he appealed that \ndenial or revocation under the provisions of DODM 5200.02. As a result of Under \nSecretary Moultrie\u2019s Memo, Applicant was given the opportunity to receive the process \nset forth in DOD Directive 5220.6, and he elected that process. (Tr. 4; HE IV) \nOn February 23, 2023, the Government issued Applicant an amended SOR (SOR\u00ad\nA1), alleging disqualifying conduct under Guideline E, personal conduct. On March 9, \n2023, Applicant submitted a written answer denying all these allegations (Applicant \nattached documents to his response). The case was assigned to me on March 14, 2023. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non March 16, 2023, and the hearing was held as scheduled on April 5, 2023. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1-15, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant \ntestified, called two witnesses, and offered Applicant exhibits (AE) A1-A274 (these \ndocuments correspond with the allegations in SOR-A1), which were admitted without \nobjection. During the course of the April 5, 2023 hearing, Department Counsel moved to \namend the SOR to add two additional allegations under Guideline E (SOR-A2). \nI granted the motion and a continuance until April 26, 2023, to allow Applicant \nadditional time to respond to the SOR-A2 allegations. He provided a written response that \ncontained his denials to the SOR-A2 allegations and also summarized his position \nregarding the original SOR allegations and those contained in SOR-A1. This document \nwas admitted into evidence as AE B1-B10. Additionally, AE C-E were admitted without \nobjection.

It received the transcript from the April 26, 2023 hearing on May 1, \n2023 (Tr2). \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old civilian employee of a defense agency. He has worked \nin his current position since October 2018. He is a security program manager. He has \nworked as a security manager or specialist for other defense organizations or federal \nagencies since 2011, and from 2002 to 2009.

Before this case was assigned to me, I had no knowledge of Applicant. \n(Tr1. 7; GE 1) \nApplicant is twice divorced. His first marriage was from 1993 to 2012 (his wife from \nthis marriage will be referred to as W1). He married a second time in 2014 and divorced \nhis second wife (W2) in 2017. He listed having two children, a boy age 22, and a girl, age \n20, on his August 2019 security clearance application (GE 1). He also listed a \nstepdaughter (SD1), age 23, on GE 1. A second former stepdaughter (SD2), the alleged \nvictim of SOR \u00b6 1.a, was not listed by Applicant on GE1, but he referred to her throughout \nhis testimony and documents as his daughter or stepdaughter. Her mother is W2. (Tr1.; \nGE 4-6) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from 1988 to 1999 and was honorably \ndischarged. He was injured while serving in Afghanistan and received a 100% disability \nrating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He holds an associate degree, two \nbachelor\u2019s degrees and a master\u2019s degree. He has held a security clearance since 1992. \n(Tr. 8, 79; GE 1) \nGuideline D and J Allegations (Original SOR) \nThe original SOR alleged concerns under the guidelines for sexual behavior and \ncriminal conduct. The form of these allegations were in a rambling narrative. In order to \nmake specific findings of fact, I asked Department Counsel to specify the conduct that \nwas being alleged in the SOR. She did so, on the record, and those allegations are also \nreflected in HE V. Under Guideline D, it is alleged that in or around November 2016 and \nApril 2017, while stationed at an overseas military location (ML-1), Applicant engaged in \ncriminal sexual behavior when he sexually abused and/or made sexually abusive contacts \nwith his stepdaughter (SD2) (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline J, it is alleged that Applicant was \narrested and indicted on October 14, 2021, in U.S. District Court on two counts of \nengaging or attempting to engage in sexual contact with SD1 and SD2 (SOR 2.a); the \noriginal indictment was voided by a superseding indictment filed on June 9, 2022. The \nsuperseding indictment charged Applicant with four counts of sexual contacts or sexual \nacts against SD2 at ML-1 and against SD1 (when she was between the ages of 12 and \n16, while residing at an overseas military location (ML-2) (SOR 2.b). (Tr1. 14-18, 26-27; \nGE 7-8, 86; HE V; SOR) \nFrom June 2003 to May 2005, Applicant was employed by a DOD agency at ML-\n2. From May 2005 to June 2009, he was employed by a different DOD agency and his \nduty location was at ML-2. During both of the above timeframes, Applicant resided in \nmilitary housing on the installations. He was married to W1 during this time. SD1 was \nborn in 1989 and was between 13 and 19 years old during the times the family was \nresiding overseas at ML-2. (GE 1-3)  \nFrom October 2016 to October 2018, Applicant was employed by a DOD agency \nthat assigned him to an overseas detail for this entire time period. This assignment was \nat ML-1. He was married to W2 at the time. W2 and SD2 resided with Applicant in military \nbase housing. In April 2017, SD2 attended her senior high school trip in the United States. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant, W2, and his stepson also traveled to the same state for their own vacation at \nthe same time as the senior trip. Applicant gave conflicting testimony about whether he \nwas in contact with SD2 during their time in the United States, other than seeing each \nother at the airport. He first claimed he had no interaction with the senior trip students \n(including SD2) until they were at the airport for their return flight to ML-1. Later, he stated \nhe went to the house where the seniors were all staying and talked with SD2. Applicant \nclaimed it was at this time that SD2 told him she had gotten a tattoo and asked him not \nto tell her mother. He claimed not to have seen the tattoo at that time. He told her to get \nit removed. He claimed he told W2 about the tattoo right away. During his background \ninterview (BI) by agents in August 2019, Applicant discussed events related to the senior \ntrip. While he discussed SD2\u2019s tattoo during the interview, he made no mention of any \nconcerns he had about SD2 getting a body piercing during that trip. (Tr1. 100-103, 110; \nGE 1, 4) \nOn April 27, 2017, SD2 contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) \non ML-1 and reported that Applicant touched her in an inappropriate manner. She gave \na formal statement where she alleged that on April 26, 2017, Applicant came into her \nbedroom and asked her to take her clothes off so he could view her tattoos and body \npiercings. He then touched her with his hands by spreading her labia apart to look at her \nvagina for piercings. She also stated that Applicant digitally penetrated her vagina one \ntime, under the guise of checking to see if she was still a virgin. SD2 was 18 years old at \nthe time of these events. She further related that over the past four years, Applicant \nadministered corporal punishment in the form of spankings to the buttocks area with a \nbelt and his hands while she was naked. (Tr1. 107; GE 5) \nLater, on April 27, 2017, Applicant was interviewed in a noncustodial setting by the \nNCIS about SD2\u2019s allegations. He admitted spanking SD2 with a belt while her pants and \nunderwear were down. He also admitted that on another occasion, he had SD2 disrobe \nand was going to spank her, but he chose to verbally reprimand her instead. He also \nadmitted checking her for piercings and tattoos while she laid on her bed and he moved \nher shorts and underwear to the side and touched her vagina to expose any piercings. \nHe denied ever penetrating SD2\u2019s vagina in any manner. (GE 5) \nDuring his hearing testimony, Applicant admitted that he checked SD2 for body \npiercings, but denied that he touched her vagina while doing so. He claimed that he was \nconcerned about her health. He stated that she was topless and in her panties during his \nviewing. He had her lay down and he claimed: \u201cI grabbed the top of her panties and I just \nlooked at it and that was it.\u201d He admitted telling his boss, Mr. C, that he viewed her genital \narea. He claimed W2, SD2\u2019s mother, was in the house while this viewing took place, but \nshe did not want to have anything to do with her daughter then. Had he seen a piercing, \nhe would have forced her to go to the hospital to get it removed, even though she was 18 \nyears old. (Tr1. 103-104, 106-111, 115, 153) \nApplicant also admitted that he spanked her bare buttocks with a belt. He stated \nthat he did not believe spanking someone on their bare buttocks who is 15 or 16 was a \nsexual act. He put it as follows: \u201cthe disciplinary action that was good enough for me when \nI was a child, is certainly good enough for her\u201d (in reference to SD2). He admitted asking \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSD2 if she was a virgin, but he denied checking her physically to confirm it. He also \nadmitted to spanking SD1 on her bare buttocks when she was a minor living in his house. \n(Tr1. 112, 114-115, 126) \nOn April 27, 2017, based upon the accusations made by SD2, the appropriate \ncommanding officer at ML-1 issued to Applicant two protective orders (PO) in favor of W2 \nand SD2. The reason for the protective orders was to protect the integrity of the ongoing \ninvestigation into the allegations that Applicant committed sexual assault and abuse \nagainst SD2. The POs restrained Applicant from having any type of contact (face-to-face, \nwritten, or electronic) with either W2 or SD2 through May 27, 2017. On May 2, 2017, \nApplicant violated this order by placing a note on or in the car driven by W2 and SD2. \nTwo follow-up POs were issued on May 5, 2017. Applicant was issued a debarment order \nfrom ML-1 on May 5, 2017, for violating the POs. The effect of the debarment required \nApplicant to immediately leave ML-1, without the rest of his family. On May 9, 2017, \nApplicant was issued travel orders sending him from ML-1 to his parent command in San \nAntonio. Because of the debarment, he was unable to complete his two-year detail to ML-\n1. W2 and SD2 remained at ML-1 after Applicant departed. They were relocated to a \ndifferent location sometime later. Applicant stated that since he departed ML-1, he has \nnot seen W2 or SD2. (Tr1. 116-118, 134; GE 9, 11-12; SOR answer (April 27, 2017 POs \nare included))   \nIn March 2018, SD1 accused Applicant of sexually abusing her. That information \nbecame available to the NCIS who documented it in a report dated January 4, 2021. \nApplicant denied all the allegations of sexual abuse by both SD1 and SD2. He \nbelieves that W1 hates him and influenced SD1 to make the allegations against him. He \nstated that SD2 had mental health issues. He claimed that she got into trouble for \npursuing relationships with younger girls. He also claimed that she engaged in self-harm \non occasions. He also claimed that SD2 demonstrated bizarre behavior while they were \nstationed at ML-1 by walking around the house naked. He also claimed that he sent SD2 \nto a psychiatrist because of her behavior. He did not provide any evidence other than his \ntestimony in support of these assertions. (Tr1. 38, 84, 93, 98; GE 4, p.19) \nOn October 14, 2021, based upon probable cause, Applicant was indicted by a \ngrand jury in Federal District Court for committing abusive sexual contact on SD2 between \nNovember 1, 2016, and April 27, 2017 (Count 1); and for committing sexual abuse on \nSD1, between June 1, 2003, and October 5, 2005 (Count 2). Based upon the forgoing \ncharges, Applicant was arrested in November 2021, and jailed pending raising bail. On \nJune 9, 2022, a superseding indictment, based upon probable cause, was filed against \nApplicant. In that indictment, Applicant was charged with four counts: On April 26, 2017, \nhe committed abusive sexual contact against SD2 (Count 1); Between June 1, 2003, and \nSeptember 30, 2005, he committed sexual abuse on SD1, a minor between the ages of \n12 and 16 (Count 2); Between September 30, 2004, and September 30, 2006, he \nattempted to engage in a sexual act by using force against SD1 (Count 3); Between \nJanuary 1, 2003, and December 31, 2008, he attempted to engage in a sexual act with \nSD1 using threats (Count 4).

Specifically, it alleged that Applicant \nfalsified his July 2013 security clearance application (SCA), Section 13A, and his \nSeptember 2011, SCA, Section 13C, when he failed to disclose that he resigned from a \nposition in August 2011, under unfavorable circumstances, as he was required to do. \n(SOR-A1 3.a-3.b, 3.e) It also alleged that Applicant falsified his 2013 SCA, Section 13A, \nand his September 2011, SCA, Section 13C, when he failed to disclose that he received \na two-day suspension from work in February or March 2010, and a 14-day suspension in \nJuly or August 2010 for work misconduct, as he was required to do. Applicant denied all \nthese allegations in his written response. (SOR-A1 3.c-3.d, 3.f-3.g) \nSOR-A2 alleged concerns under Guideline E. Specifically, it alleged that Applicant \nfalsified his August 2019 SCA, Section 13A, when he stated that he left his position \nbecause he had completed his two-year detail, thereby deliberately failing to disclose that \nhe was removed from his position on May 5, 2017, because he was indefinitely debarred \nfrom his work location before the end of his assigned detail there. (SOR-A2 3.h) It further \nalleged that Applicant falsified his August 2019 SCA, Section 13A, when asked if he had \nleft any employment after allegations of misconduct, by deliberately failing to disclose that \nhe was removed from his position on May 5, 2017, because he was indefinitely debarred \nfrom his work location before the end of his assigned detail there. (SOR-A2 3.i) Applicant \ndenied all these allegations in his written response (AE B1-B10). \nFrom approximately June 2009 to August 2011, Applicant was employed by a DOD \nagency in the position of security manager. During the course of that employment, he \nreceived several disciplinary actions, to include: (1) a November 30, 2009 written \ncounseling for being disrespectful to a work supervisor; (2) a two-day suspension on \nMarch 29, 2010, for failing to accomplish several elements of his assignment and not \ncomplying with higher-level direction; and (3) a 14-day suspension for failing to follow \nproper procedures by not informing his supervisor of a meeting Applicant scheduled to \npresent a plan proposing organizational change to his supervisor\u2019s organization. (GE 4, \np. 7; AE A34, A254-A255) \nDuring his August 2019 BI, Applicant admitted the two suspensions, but denied \nthe counseling. He also admitted the suspensions in his hearing testimony, but initially \ndenied the counseling. When reminded that the written counseling was a part of his \nexhibits (AE A34), he claimed that it was produced after the fact. Applicant failed to list \nthese incidents on his 2011 (AE 3, p. 23 of Section 13C) and 2013 SCAs (AE 2, p. 15 of \nSection 13A), as he was required to do. The counseling was not specifically alleged as \nan incident that should have been listed in the SCAs, so I will not use that evidence for \ndisqualification purposes, but I may use it to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, the applicability \nof any mitigating circumstances, and in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has an \nextensive background in security positions, has completed numerous SCAs during his \ncareer, and has assisted others in completing SCAs. He admitted in his testimony that he \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndid not accurately report the information about his previous two work suspensions.

Applicant contested this action before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB). \nOn May 9, 2011, Applicant and the agency entered into a settlement agreement accepted \nby the MSPB. As part of the agreement, the agency rescinded the actions removing \nApplicant from employment for cause and Applicant agreed to resign from his position \neffective in August 2011. Other than requiring the agency to remove the removal \ndocumentation from Applicant\u2019s official personnel records, the agreement had no effect \non his two prior disciplinary suspensions. Applicant also agreed never to apply to the \nagency for future employment. (AE A1-A3) \nApplicant completed two SCAs on September 15, 2011 and July 1, 2013. Applicant \nfailed to accurately state that in August 2011, he left employment with his agency by \nmutual agreement following charges or allegations of misconduct, or under unfavorable \ncircumstances on his 2011 (AE 3, p. 23 of Section 13C) and 2013 SCAs (AE 2, p. 15 of \nSection 13A), as he was required to do. In his 2013 SCA, he specifically stated his reason \nfor leaving the agency was: \u201cCareer progression to a position at a federal government \nagency in law enforcement.\u201d During his BI, Applicant initially denied his leaving \nemployment by mutual agreement after allegations of misconduct, as discussed above. \nHe was then confronted by the agent and admitted he left the agency on bad terms after \nhe raised allegations of misconduct by management. (GE 2-4) \nGuideline E Allegations (SOR A-2) \nOn August 10, 2019, Applicant completed another SCA. This followed his \ndeparture from the detail at ML-1 because of his debarment from the installation in May \n2017. In completing his SCA concerning his employment at ML-1 from October 2016 to \nOctober 2018, he was asked to provide the reason for leaving this employment activity \nand stated: \u201cTwo year detail overseas completed.\u201d He failed to provide any information \nabout the sexual misconduct allegations that led to the POs, which were violated leading \nto his debarment from the installation. (GE 1, 4, 9, 11-12) \nOn GE 1, Applicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to the question of whether he left any \nemployment in the last seven years because of being fired, or quitting after being told he \nwould be fired, or he left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct, or he left by mutual agreement because of unsatisfactory performance. \nWhen Applicant referred in this SCA to his earlier employment at the agency where he \nworked from June 2009 to August 2011, he again stated his reason for leaving was: \n\u201cCareer progression to a position at a federal agency in law enforcement.\u201d (GE 1) \nDuring his hearing testimony, he stated that he answered as he did on GE 1, about \nhis May 2017 departure from ML-1, because he returned to his parent organization in the \nUnited States upon his debarment.

I found his testimony to be inconsistent, misleading, and \nself-serving. There were a number of times where he provided inconsistent information \nduring his testimony with either earlier testimony or previous statements. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor at ML-1, Mr. C. He has been a security specialist for a \nDOD agency for 25 years He was at ML-1 from November 2015 to November 2018 and \nhe was Applicant\u2019s supervisor during his time there. He was not present on island when \nApplicant was interviewed by the NCIS. He saw Applicant about three to four days later. \nApplicant told him that he viewed SD2\u2019s genital area to see if she had any piercings there. \nHe did this for hygienic purposes. Mr. C was aware that SD2 had some issues at school \nwith which Applicant was involved. He saw the family in a social setting three to four times, \nbut he did not notice anything unusual about their interaction. He opined that Applicant \nhas integrity and can be trusted. (Tr1. 58-68) \nApplicant\u2019s coworker at ML-1, Ms. W. She talked with Applicant the day after his \ninterview with NCIS. He was upset about the interview, told her about the allegations, and \ndenied the conduct. He also told her that SD2 had been seen by a mental health \nprofessional. She had seen Applicant\u2019s family together at one or two social functions and \nthought they were a normal family. She stated that Applicant is outstanding to work with \nand is helpful and pleasant. She believes he should retain his security clearance. (Tr1. \n71-76) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for sexual behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1111 \nSD2 alleged that Applicant sexually abused her between November 2016 and April \n2017, when they were living on a military installation at ML-1. She gave a statement to \nthe NCIS detailing the abuse. In November 2021, Applicant was charged in Federal \nDistrict Court (superseded by an indictment in June 2022) based, in part, on these \nallegations. Applicant denied the allegations. His denials are not credible in light of his \nadmissions of looking at his 18-year-old stepdaughter\u2019s vaginal area to see if she had a \npiercing, his admission that he queried her on her virginity, and his admission that he \nused corporal punishment on SD2 by spanking her with her pants and underwear pulled \ndown. I did not find his explanation about why he engaged in these actions with SD2 \nrather than her mother, W2, credible. The above disqualifying condition applies to SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. (See HE V) \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for sexual behavior under \nAG \u00b6 14 and considered the following potentially relevant: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet \nApplicant\u2019s sexual contact with SD2 occurred in 2017. He denies the allegation \nand is awaiting trial. While he has no further contact with SD2, his past actions of sexually \nabusing his stepdaughter cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nThere is no evidence to support that Applicant acted based upon consent. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) \nand 14(d) do not apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s former stepdaughters (SD1 and SD2) accused him of sexual \nmisconduct and spoke to authorities about his misconduct. That information was \npresented to a federal grand jury, which based upon probable cause, returned an \nindictment in November 2021 against Applicant on the evidence presented.

(See HE V) \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and   \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s underlying sexual misconduct occurred from approximately 2003 \nto 2008 and from 2016 to April 2017, it occurred against his two stepdaughters who \ntrusted him to protect them, not abuse them. He denied all the charges and is awaiting \ntrial. I do not find his denials credible. Both SD1 and SD2 came forward to authorities and \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual actions. His willingness to take advantage of his \nstepchildren, who trusted him, casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(c) do not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant deliberately provided false or misleading information on his 2011 SCA \n(GE 3) and his 2013 SCA (GE 2) concerning his prior disciplinary history and the reason \nfor his leaving the agency where he worked from June 2009 to August 2011. He is a \nhighly educated person, who has served as a security manager in a number of positions, \nhas filled out numerous SCAs himself, and assisted others in doing so. Additionally, he \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompleted the 2011 SCA within one month of his resignation from the agency, so it would \nbe fresh in his mind. With this background, he was fully aware of his responsibilities to \nprovide truthful, non-misleading information when answering questions about his \nprevious work experiences. The MSPB settlement agreement between the agency and \nApplicant had no bearing on his responsibility to provide accurate information on his \nSCAs. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR-A1 \u00b6\u00b6 3.a-3.g. \nApplicant provided deliberately false and misleading information on his 2019 SCA \n(GE 1) concerning the circumstances for him leaving his employment duties because of \nhis debarment in May 2017. He stated on his SCA that the reason for leaving ML-1 was \n\u201cTwo year detail overseas completed.\u201d This was at best a misleading entry and at worst \na false statement. He was forced to leave his position and his family on ML-1 because of \nviolating a PO in favor of W2 and SD2, which resulted in his debarment from the \ninstallation and required his exit from the island. He was originally scheduled to remain at \nML-1 until October 2018. He is a highly educated person, who has served as a security \nmanager in a number of positions, has filled out numerous SCAs himself, and assisted \nothers in doing so. With this background, he was fully aware of his responsibilities to \nprovide truthful, non-misleading information when answering questions about his leaving \nML-1. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR-A2 \u00b6 3.h. As for SOR-A2 \u00b6 3.i, I find in favor of Applicant \nbecause even though Applicant\u2019s departure from ML-1 followed allegations of his \nmisconduct, his departure from the island was a unilateral act by the command, not a \nmutual agreement by the command and Applicant. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 \nand found the following relevant: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nIntentionally providing false information on not one, but three different SCAs, does \nnot equate with committing minor offenses and doing so certainly casts doubt on \nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. The record contains no \nevidence that he attempted to correct the false and misleading information through the \nyears. His actions are even more egregious because he is a security manager with years \nof knowledge and experience in this area. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D, J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his deployments and his VA \ndisability, his civilian service, and the testimony of his witnesses. However, I also \nconsidered his serious sexual misconduct with two stepchildren and his position as a \nsecurity manager. The evidence causes me to question his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the Guideline D, J, or E security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph: 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 2.a-2.b:\nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs: 3.a-3.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph: 3.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was a passenger in the backseat of his friend\u2019s off roading vehicle, \nwhile off roading, when the vehicle rolled over. Applicant stuck his hand out during the \nroll and broke it. He underwent five surgeries and spent three weeks in the hospital. \nThis was followed by home care and therapy until he could no longer afford it. Applicant \nsubmitted medical records corroborating his injury. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit \nD.) During this time, Applicant could not work and to support himself and his family, he \ncollected unemployment and disability.

(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant incurred excessive delinquent debt that he has been unable to pay.   \nHis actions or inactions both demonstrate a history of not addressing his debt and an \ninability to do so. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n (g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is incompliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s accident in 2019, and then his inability to work for three years, largely \ncontributed to his financial delinquencies. However, for the past year and a half he has \nbeen working full time with over time. He has slowly started paying some of his smaller \ndebts off. However, he remains excessively indebted. There is no evidence showing \nthat he has made significant progress towards resolving his debts. In fact, the only \ndebts he states he has paid on his own, but provided no documentary evidence to \nconfirm, were his medical co-pay accounts which required only a small payment of $50 \nor $75. Two other debts are being paid through garnishment or automatic payments, \nand the bulk of the debt remains owing. Most troubling is the fact that Applicant has \nbetween $2,500 and $3,000 in discretionary funds each month that he could use to pay \nhis delinquent debts, but has chosen not to do so. This does not show good judgment. \nIf fact, Applicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and inaction for so long casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant needs more time to \nshow the Government that he will continue to properly resolve his financial \ndelinquencies with regular systematic payments and consistency. \nNone of the \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts have been resolved. Overall, Applicant shows little progress towards resolving \nhis debts. He still owes a significant amount of money to his creditors that he obviously \nhas not seen as a priority to resolve. There is insufficient evidence in the record to \nshow that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \ngovernment security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn the event that \nApplicant follows through with his commitment to show financial responsibility, \nsometime in the future he may be found to be sufficiently reliable to properly protect and \naccess classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.x. \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c., 1.o., and 1.r. \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, \nI make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He never married. He has a nine-year-old child. He has \nworked for a federal contractor since August 2019. \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2021. In \nresponse to Section 22-Police Record, that asked if he had been arrested, summoned, \ncited, or received a ticket to appear as a result of an offense by a police officer, sheriff, \nmarshal or any other type of law enforcement official, he responded \u201cyes.\u201d He disclosed \nan offense that occurred in March 2018, specifically: \u201cDriving without tags or insurance, \nalcohol possession.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant was arrested and charged in about January 2019 with disorderly \nconduct. In December 2018, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence \nof alcohol (DUI), transporting an open container, vehicle liability insurance required, failing \nto carry/exhibit driver\u2019s license upon demand, and unlawful acts with vehicle (registration). \nIn December 2018, he was arrested and charged with domestic battery. In March 2018, \nhe was arrested and charged with domestic battery. Applicant did not disclose these \narrests and charges on his SCA, except as noted. (Item 2) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on October 6, 2021. He \nverified his financial information and that there was nothing about his character that could \nbe used against him for coercion. He was interviewed again on October 16, 2021, and \nwas confronted with his unreported arrests and activity with the police. Police reports \ncorroborate the above arrests.

He told the investigator \nthat he went to court but could not recall when. He said the charge was dismissed. (Items \n3, 4) \nApplicant admitted during this interview that in December 2018 he was arrested \nfor DUI, transporting an open container, lack of vehicle liability insurance, failure to \ncarry/exhibit driver\u2019s license, and unlawful acts with a vehicle (registration). The county \nattorney filed charges against him. In his SCA, he disclosed only the insurance and open \ncontainer offenses.

He told the investigator that he should not have been driving after \nconsuming alcohol. (Items 3, 5) \nApplicant was arrested and charged with domestic battery in December 2018. He \nwas involved in a fight with his uncle which began at a bar and continued at his uncle\u2019s \nhome. He could not recall when he went to court, but he agreed that he had been charged \nand the charges were dismissed. (Items 3, 6) \nApplicant admitted during his interview that he was arrested in March 2018 and \ncharged with domestic battery. This incident again involved a fight with his uncle. He went \nto court but could not recall when. The charge was dismissed. (Items 3, 7) \nApplicant was repeatedly arrested and charged with various offenses. He admitted \ngoing to court. The only arrest he disclosed on his SCA was that he failed to have proper \ninsurance and possession of alcohol. He was also arrested at the same time with DUI, \nwhich he did not disclose. During that incident, he was handcuffed, refused to take the \nbreathalyzer, had a blood draw at the hospital, and then was transported to jail. When \nconfronted with these arrests by the government investigator he stated, \u201che did not list \nany of these charges because he did not think he needed to.\u201d (Item 3) He later told the \ngovernment investigator that he was not charged, and the case was dismissed. I do not \nfind his explanation credible for why he failed to disclose his numerous arrests. There is \nsubstantial evidence to conclude he deliberately failed to disclose his arrest for DUI and \nhis other arrests. (Item 3) \nApplicant was arrested and charged in August 2009 with burglary, theft, and \ncriminal damage to property. During his background interview, he admitted he and an \naccomplice went to an apartment of a friend who was in prison at the time, entered and \nretrieved items that Applicant stated belonged to him. While there with his accomplice, \nthe police arrived, arrested them, and charged them as stated above. Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator that his friend, who was in prison, had borrowed some of his \nvideo games. He told the government investigator that when he entered his friend\u2019s \napartment, he did not know it would be unlocked. He said he went to the apartment \ncomplex office to ask them to let him into the apartment, and they would not let him in. \nHe said he then went to the apartment, and it was unlocked so he went in to get his things. \nHe retrieved the video games and a PlayStation Three, which he said belonged to him. \nHe told the investigator that all of the charges were dismissed except one, but he could \nnot recall which one. He went to court and was found guilty of a charge. He was fined and \nplaced on probation for 24 months. He could not recall the dates of his probation.

(Item 8) \nApplicant\u2019s statement contradicts the police report which noted the pad lock was cut off \nthe door. He did not have his friend\u2019s permission to enter the apartment. (Items 3, 8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.\n \n \n \n \nApplicant was repeatedly involved in fights with his uncle that required police \nintervention and he was arrested. He also was arrested for DUI, open container, failure \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto have vehicle liability insurance, failing to carry/exhibit driver\u2019s license upon demand \nand vehicle registration requirements. He deliberately failed to disclose on his SCA his \nnumerous arrests for fighting with his uncle, DUI, and other offenses. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(g) association with person involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant did not correct his response in his SCA regarding his past arrests. He \nwas confronted by the investigator with his numerous arrests. I did not find his explanation \nto the government investigator credible. Failing to be honest on a SCA is not minor. The \ncornerstone of the security clearance process is that the Government trusts those who \nare granted security clearances to be honest and self-report issues or conduct even when \nno one is looking. Applicant failed to do that. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply. \nApplicant has numerous arrests for fighting with his uncle and the police \nintervened. He was arrested for DUI and other violations. He was also arrested in 2009 \nfor burglary and theft. His statement contracts the police report. He has not provided any \nevidence on whether he continues to associate with his uncle or any other evidence to \nsupport mitigating the security concerns raised by his conduct. Although, some of his \narrests are relatively minor, there is a continuing pattern of failing to abide by rules and \nregulations that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d) and 17(g) do not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He admitted the delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f. He denied SOR \u00b6 2.c. He did not answer the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.a, so I construe his answer as a denial. He denied the allegation of deliberate falsification of his SCA at SOR \u00b6 3.b. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 26 years old. He graduated from high school in 2016. He held several jobs in retail and as a security officer until he enlisted in the Navy. He served on active duty in the Navy from February 2021 until March 2022, when he was discharged after he tested positive for THC. He was then unemployed until June 2022 when he began working for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a defense contractor. (Item 2) Applicant was married in February 2021 and divorced in June 2022. He remarried two months later, in August 2022.

He was afforded an opportunity to note objections \nand to submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation, and was given 30 days \nfrom receipt of the FORM to do so. Applicant signed for receipt of the FORM on May 18, \n2023. No subsequent response from Applicant was received by DOHA, and the case \nwas assigned to me on September 11, 2023. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, \nhe did not submit any evidence after responding to the SOR, nor did he pose any \nobjections to admission of the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 2 through 7 are therefore \nadmitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the drug-related allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. He \nadmitted the delinquent debts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f. He denied \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. He did not answer the cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.a, so I construe his \nanswer as a denial. He denied the allegation of deliberate falsification of his SCA at \nSOR \u00b6 3.b. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 26 years old. He graduated from high school in 2016. He held \nseveral jobs in retail and as a security officer until he enlisted in the Navy. He served on \nactive duty in the Navy from February 2021 until March 2022, when he was discharged \nafter he tested positive for THC. He was then unemployed until June 2022 when he \nbegan working for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a defense contractor. \n(Item 2) Applicant was married in February 2021 and divorced in June 2022. He \nremarried two months later, in August 2022. (Item 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant used THC \u201con various occasions between at \nleast approximately November 2021 and February 2022.\u201d Applicant admitted the \nallegation without further comment. (Item 1) This is based on his disclosure of THC use \nduring that timeframe on his September 2022 SCA. However, he denied knowingly \nconsuming THC, asserting that he thought he was vaping nicotine. (Item 2 at 35) \nApplicant explained in his background interview that he tested positive for THC \nfollowing a routine drug test, in November 2021. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He was notified of the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npositive test in February 2022.

He denied \nbeing given such a list. He was given the list during the proceeding and recognized a \nvape shop he had visited. He said he purchased and ingested a substance without \nlooking at the label. He asserted that he did not know he was ingesting THC. He was \nfound guilty at Chief\u2019s Mast and sent to Captain\u2019s Mast, where he was also found guilty, \non the grounds that he should have known what he was ingesting. While he said he \nwanted to go to court martial, Applicant chose to plead guilty and accept 45 days of \nrestricted duty as non-judicial punishment and a general discharge under honorable \nconditions. (Item 2 at 34-36; Item 4 at 5-6) \nApplicant adopted his background interview summary as accurate in a February \n2023 interrogatory response. (Item 4) In answering further questions about his drug \ninvolvement, he denied ever using or purchasing illegal drugs, such as marijuana. He \nacknowledged that \u201cdespite any state laws to the contrary, marijuana use remains illegal \nunder Federal law\u201d and therefore if he were to be granted a clearance or public trust \nposition, any future use of marijuana may affect his eligibility.\u201d (Item 4) He disavowed \nany future intent to use THC, marijuana, or \u201cany other drugs illegally in the future.\u201d (Item \n4 at 13) He made a similar vow on his most recent SCA. (Item 2 at 35) \nThe record includes several credit bureau reports (CBRs), dated November \n2020, September 2022, and March 2023. (Items 5, 6, and 7), which establish the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR under Guideline F. \nThe six SOR debts total $10,803. Applicant provided no indication that any debts \nhave been, or are being, paid. The debts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($396) is a debt placed for collection by an insurance company. SOR \n\u00b6 1.b ($702) is a charged-off account with a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.c ($1,194), which Applicant \ndenied, is a cell phone account that has been placed for collection. SOR \u00b6 1.d ($5,395) \nis a charged-off account with a bank. SOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,995) is a charged-off credit card \naccount. All of these accounts are listed as past due on CBRs in September 2022 and \nMarch 2023. (Items 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($1,121) is a credit account that has been charged off by a jeweler. \n(Item 6) On the March 2023 CBR, however, the account has a zero balance. (Item 7). \nThis account is resolved. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his SCA. (Item 2 at 39-40) In \nhis background interview, he verified his negative answers to financial questions on his \nSCA and was then confronted with evidence of his various delinquencies. (Item 4 at 6) \nOnce confronted, he agreed with the accounts. He did not recall some of them but did \nnot dispute the listings on the credit report. He said he would look into the accounts and \nobtain documentation.

In answering SOR \u00b6 3.b, \nwhich alleges that he deliberately failed to disclose the debts when he filled out his \nSCA, he said, \u201cI admit but I don\u2019t remember answering this question as I gave my agent \nall the account information that I had.\u201d (SOR Response) \nApplicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM, so no more recent \ninformation about him is available. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). \nThe current National Security Adjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, \n2017, after 2014 DNI memo was issued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The memo \nincorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) among \nvarious other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency.  \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d Thus, consistent with these references, the \nAGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nApplicant tested positive for THC in November 2021 after visiting a vaping shop \nnear his base and using a product he purchased there.

SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that he used THC \u201con \nvarious occasions\u201d between November 2021 and February 2022. He admitted the \nallegation without further comment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) apply. The fact that Applicant \nwas discharged from the Navy (as noted in SOR \u00b6 1.b) was a consequence of his \nconduct, but it is not itself disqualifying conduct under Guideline H. \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAs the 2021 DNI memo notes, relevant mitigating factors under the AGs include, \nbut are not limited to: \nfrequency of use and whether the individual can demonstrate that future \nuse is unlikely to recur, including by signing an attestation or other such \nappropriate mitigation. Additionally, in light of the long-standing federal law \nand policy prohibiting illegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position \nor holding a security clearance, agencies are encouraged to advise \nprospective national security workforce employees that they should refrain \nfrom any future marijuana use upon initiation of the national security \nvetting process, which commences once the individual signs the \ncertification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions. \nApplicant used THC that was contained in a product that he purchased at a vape \nshop near his base while serving in the Navy. He asserted that his use was unknowing \nand not intentional, but he was found guilty after testing positive for THC and \ndischarged from the Navy. His use is relatively recent, as it occurred less than two years \nago. He has asserted that he will not use THC or other illegal drugs again and has \nacknowledged specifically that marijuana use is illegal under federal law. However, \nhaving waived his right to a hearing, he is not subject to questioning about what \nhappened, and there is no way to test the veracity of his assertions of reform and \nrehabilitation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not establish that his illegal drug use is infrequent, isolated, \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, or does not cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to establish that he has disassociated from drug-using associates or contacts, \nnor that he has changed the environment where drugs were used. In short, Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient information to apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or 26(b) in mitigation. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and\n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nApplicant has incurred several delinquent debts, totaling about $10,000. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns \nshown by his various delinquent debts. He ultimately acknowledged the debts in his \nbackground interview and admitted most of them in his SOR response. He offered no \nsubsequent information about either the origin or resolution of the debts which might be \nconsidered in mitigation. It is his burden to set forth such evidence. Applicant needs to \nset forth a reasonable plan for addressing his delinquencies and then must put that plan \ninto effect through regular payments to establish good faith. He has not yet done so. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are therefore unresolved, ongoing, and continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. No mitigating conditions are \nestablished by this record. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.a is merely a cross-allegation of the drug involvement allegations in \nSOR \u00b6 1 and the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6 2. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established, as it \nrequires \u201ccredible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under any other single guideline. . . .\u201d The personal \nconduct general concern (AG \u00b6 15) is established given that Applicant\u2019s admitted \nconduct establishes his questionable judgment. However, since the conduct is fully \naddressed under other guidelines, I consider the cross-allegation to be duplicative, and I \nfind for Applicant on that basis. \nSOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his six delinquent \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) on his September 2022 SCA. Applicant \u201cadmitted\u201d the allegation \nbut asserted that he did not recall answering the question, an explanation which I \ninterpret as a denial. \nIn his background interview, Applicant did not acknowledge any debts until he \nwas confronted about them. The Government has the burden of establishing allegations \nthat the applicant denies. While the omission of the debts is shown, I do not find on this \nrecord that it is established that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose those debts on \nhis September 2022 SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. Thus, neither SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a or \n3.b are established as disqualifying personal conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant did not submit any evidence in response to the SOR, nor did he \nrespond to the FORM, opportunities where he might have offered additional evidence, \neither in mitigation or at least explanation, either under the guidelines alleged or under \nthe whole-person concept. He also waived his right to a hearing, so I did not have the \nopportunity to observe his demeanor or to assess the credibility of his assertions. \nApplicant seeks a security clearance through his employment with a DOD \ncontractor. and marijuana remains a Schedule 1 controlled substance under federal law. \nHe used THC as recently as November 2021, while serving in the Navy \u2013 a \ncircumstance which led to his discharge. Applicant also has delinquent debts for which \nhe has set forth no evidence of resolution. \nApplicant has not met his burden of showing that he has fully mitigated the \nsecurity concerns set forth by his illegal drug use and delinquent debts in such a way as \nto warrant eligibility for access to classified information. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b. He owes $28,950 in delinquent student loan debt. He specifically listed SOR \u00b6 1.b in his SCA. (Item 3 at 32 and Item 4 at 4-6.) His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 29-year-old tool crib assistant. He has worked for his sponsor since September 2022. He received an associate degree in 2015. He has never held a security clearance. He is engaged but has never been married and has no children. (Item 3 at 5, 9, 10, 18-19, 30.) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b are student loans placed for collection totaling $17,645 and $11,304. In Applicant\u2019s SCA, he cited the reason for the delinquency as the \u201ccost of living keeps rising and the pay rate stays the same.\u201d He adds that \u201cno action has been taken due to searching for stable paying job to provide for the high cost of living.\u201d (Item 3 at 32, 33.) The student loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was assigned for collection in November 2018 and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was assigned for collection in September 2016. (Item 5 at 2.) Applicant worked in the food service industry while in school from 2013 until 2015. In 2016 he obtained his first job in his field. He left the company to complete a test and join another company, with a slight break in employment. In November 2020 he was let go and remained unemployed until September 2022.

I conclude that Applicant waived any \nobjections to the ESI summary by failing to respond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b. He \nowes $28,950 in delinquent student loan debt. He specifically listed SOR \u00b6 1.b in his SCA. \n(Item 3 at 32 and Item 4 at 4-6.) His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old tool crib assistant. He has worked for his sponsor since \nSeptember 2022. He received an associate degree in 2015. He has never held a security \nclearance. He is engaged but has never been married and has no children. (Item 3 at 5, \n9, 10, 18-19, 30.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-b are student loans placed for collection totaling $17,645 and \n$11,304. In Applicant\u2019s SCA, he cited the reason for the delinquency as the \u201ccost of living \nkeeps rising and the pay rate stays the same.\u201d He adds that \u201cno action has been taken \ndue to searching for stable paying job to provide for the high cost of living.\u201d (Item 3 at 32, \n33.) The student loan debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was assigned for collection in November \n2018 and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was assigned for collection in September 2016. \n(Item 5 at 2.) \nApplicant worked in the food service industry while in school from 2013 until 2015. \nIn 2016 he obtained his first job in his field. He left the company to complete a test and \njoin another company, with a slight break in employment. In November 2020 he was let \ngo and remained unemployed until September 2022. (Item 3 at 10-16 and Item 4 at 2.) \nDuring this period of unemployment, he took a trip in 2021 to a South American country \nfor more than 20 days of tourism, and in 2022 he took a trip of more than 10 days to a \nCaribbean nation to visit family and friends. (Item 3 at 24-25.) He referenced working with \na debt relief company in his ESI and that he had stopped making his student loan \npayments in order to pay his rent.

However, the balances remain the same as the delinquencies shown on the \nOctober 2022 credit report. (Item 5.) There is no evidence of any payments made on \nthese student loans since March 2020. (Item 4 at 3-4.) \nI have taken administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the President directed the Department of Education (DoEd) to provide the \nfollowing temporary relief on DoEd-owned federal student loans: suspension of loan \npayments, stopped collections on defaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, \n2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for \nthe above relief measures through September 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) \nwebsite, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt \nrelief was extended several times by subsequent Executive Orders. See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. Congress recently barred any \nfurther extensions and DoEd has announced that student loan repayments will resume in \nOctober 2023. See https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are established by the evidence: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant's federal student loans were assigned for collection prior to 2020. A \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While \nhis student loans may no longer be considered delinquent since March 2020 because of \nthe COVID-19 deferment, that action does not excuse previously delinquent student loans \nsuch as these. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). The above \nlisted conditions are made applicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, thereby shifting the burden \nto Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admits he has failed to settle the alleged debts and he provided no \nevidence he has availed himself of any of the COVID relief options. Even if he has availed \nhimself of any of the COVID relief options it is his pre-Covid relief student loan \ndelinquencies that led to collection and the insufficiency of the evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances that are determinative. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant experienced almost two years of \nunemployment, a condition largely beyond his control. During that period of \nunemployment and while his student loans remained unpaid, he took a tourist trip to South \nAmerica. His actions and statements regarding his handling of the debts alleged prior to \nany COVID relief options show that he has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, \n2021) addressed this factual situation noting in that case \u201cthe Judge addressed this issue \nby concluding that, while the President\u2019s action effectively places Applicant\u2019s student \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n    \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nloans in a deferment status, \u201cit does not excuse Applicant\u2019s past inactions in the context \nof security clearance eligibility.\u201d Decision at 9. A credit report in the record reflects that \nApplicant\u2019s student loan delinquencies date back to at least December 2014. FORM Items \n5 at 6-7 and 7 at 2. Based on that evidence, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s conclusion.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant provided no documentary evidence that \nsupports his ESI statements that he had contacted his student loan creditors or worked \nwith a debt relief company. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He served on active duty with the Army from June 2014 until April 2018, when \nhe earned an honorable discharge. (Items 2-5) \nFrom about October 2006 through September 2022, Applicant used marijuana \nwith varying frequency. At all times relevant to this investigation, marijuana possession \n(and therefore its use) has been illegal. Despite being required to do so, Applicant failed \nto disclose this illegal drug use on his February 2022 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (2022 e-QIP) or his April 2020 Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (2020 e-QIP). He possessed a security clearance at certain \ntimes while he was using marijuana but, despite being required to do so, he failed to \nalso disclose on his 2022 e-QIP and 2020 e-QIP that his use of marijuana occurred \nwhile holding a clearance. \nAfter Applicant denied marijuana use within seven years of submitting his 2020 \ne-QIP, the DOD authorized investigator who conducted his August 2020 security \ninterview confronted him with information that he used marijuana with varying frequency \nwithin that time frame. After being confronted, he lied and said that he only used \nmarijuana with varying frequency between 2011 and 2013. When the investigator asked \nhim about illegal drug use while holding a security clearance, he also lied and told the \ninvestigator that he only used \u201cCBD oil\u201d that did not contain marijuana. He untruthfully \nclaimed that he did not list his illegal drug use on his 2020 e-QIP because it was longer \nago than seven years. (Items 2-5) \nAfter failing to disclose his illegal drug use, to include his illegal drug use while \nholding a clearance, on his 2022 e-QIP, Applicant had another interview with a DOD \nauthorized investigator in September 2022. This time, when the investigator asked \nabout his drug use, he admitted his 2006 through 2022 marijuana use, including use \nwhile he held a security clearance. When the investigator asked why he did not disclose \nthis information on his 2022 e-QIP, he admitted he intentionally omitted the information \nbecause of a sense of fear. (Items 2-5) \nApplicant also told the investigator in 2022 the truth about his marijuana usage \nbecause he had received a letter in February 2022, asking him to address \ninconsistencies in his drug use reporting between his 2020 investigation and his 2022 e-\nQIP. He therefore did not voluntarily divulge his illegal drug use before being \nconfronted. He also continued to use marijuana after receiving this letter. He claimed \nthat he told his supervisor about his illegal drug use and intentional falsifications. He \nalso admitted to the investigator during his 2022 background interview that he made up \nthe story he told during his 2020 background interview, about using CBD oil, to cover for \nhis actual marijuana use. He clarified that he did not use marijuana while he was in the \nmilitary from 2014 to 2018, but he used it before and after those years.

(Items 2-5) \nIn August 2019, after a night out drinking alcohol, Applicant was arrested on \nsuspicion of misdemeanor DUI. He failed a field sobriety test and, after being given a \nbreathalyzer test, his blood alcohol percentage was between .14 and .16 percent. He \npleaded guilty to this DUI charge and the court suspended his driver\u2019s license for up to \none year, required him to undergo impaired driver care management, install an ignition \ninterlock device in his car, and pay fines and court costs. He complied with his \nsentencing requirements. He divulged this arrest and conviction on his 2020 e-QIP and \nduring the 2020 interview with a DOD authorized investigator. During that interview, he \nclaimed he would never drink and drive again. (Items 2-6) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR, which were related \nto his marijuana use, his failure to divulge his marijuana use in his 2020 and 2022 e-\nQIPs, his lying to the DOD authorized investigator in 2020 about his marijuana use, and \nhis 2019 DUI arrest and conviction. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of \nfact. He provided no additional narrative or explanation with his Answer and did not \nrespond to the FORM. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant illegally used marijuana with varying frequency from 2006 until \nSeptember 2022. The above disqualifying condition is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has used marijuana for a lengthy period of time that dwarfs the amount \nof time that he could have been abstinent (since September 2022). He consistently lied \nabout his use throughout the security clearance process and continued to use it even \nafter believing he had been caught in February 2022. Given his intentional dishonesty \nand lack of candor, I cannot take him at his word that he will no longer use illegal drugs. \nWhile he has acknowledged his drug involvement, he has not provided actions he has \ntaken to overcome his problem. He failed to provide sufficient evidence that his \nmarijuana involvement and the circumstances surrounding it do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the Guideline H \nmitigating conditions fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official. \nApplicant deliberately omitted his illegal drug use from multiple locations on his \n2020 e-QIP and 2022 e-QIP. In March 2020, he also deliberately lied to a DOD \nauthorized investigator about his marijuana use. Both of the above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant did not correct his omission or concealment of his marijuana use prior \nto being confronted with the facts. Instead, he lied to the investigator in 2020 after being \nconfronted, and he waited to disclose the truth until after he received a letter notifying \nhim that there were inconsistencies in his reporting about his marijuana use. AG \u00b6 17(a) \ndoes not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDeliberately omitting required information and lying to DOD investigators is not \nminor. Instead, these actions strike at the heart of the security clearance process, which \nrelies on candid and honest reporting. Applicant engaged in this deceitful and \nmisleading activity multiple times over two separate investigations. Therefore, he has \nnot shown that his behavior was infrequent, happened under unique circumstances, or \nis unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nWhile Applicant ultimately acknowledged his intentionally dishonest behavior, he \nhas provided no evidence of counseling or other steps he has taken to alleviate this \nbehavior. Moreover, for the reasons I provided in my analysis of AG \u00b6 17(c), I cannot \nfind his behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nThe only positive step Applicant has taken to reduce vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress is that he claimed he has told his supervisor about his \nmarijuana involvement and falsifications. AG \u00b6 17(e) partially applies but does not \novercome his repeated deceitful and untrustworthy personal conduct. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn 2019, Applicant drove while he was intoxicated and was arrested and \nconvicted. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition, thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs it has been about four years since Applicant drove while under the influence \nof alcohol, at first blush, it would appear that a significant amount of time has passed \nsince he engaged in criminal behavior. However, as he admitted he intentionally omitted \nand lied about his illegal drug use, he was being untruthful about a material fact relevant \nto a security clearance adjudication. Falsifying material information in a security \nclearance adjudication is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001. He also was \nusing an illegal drug until September 2022. Therefore, Applicant continued to engage in \ncriminal behavior until September 2022, undercutting his efforts at mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d), which require the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal acts. Given the recency of his criminal activity, AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do \nnot apply. AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply because there is reliable evidence of his driving \nunder the influence of alcohol in the form of credible allegations and his guilty plea. \nNone of the Guideline J mitigating conditions apply. The criminal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse, personal conduct, and criminal \nconduct security concerns \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The first time he used cocaine was around March 2013 \nwhen he was a freshman in college. (Tr. 28-29) He used a small amount of cocaine, which \nhe referred to as a \u201cbump.\u201d (Tr. 29) \nPrior to May 2019, Applicant most recently drilled with the ARNG in March 2019. \nThe next time he used cocaine after March of 2013 was in May of 2019.

(Tr. 35) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges in about June 2019, Applicant used the prescription medication \nXanax without a prescription. \nSOR \u00b6 3.a alleges in about June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with \npublic intoxication and possession of cocaine. Applicant\u2019s brother gave him a bag \ncontaining cocaine in May 2019, and he used some and placed the remainder in his wallet \nbehind a flap. (Tr. 57-58) The small bag contained cocaine residue, and Applicant forgot \nthat he put it in his wallet. (Tr. 44, 56, 58; SOR response) In June 2019, he consumed \none Xanax pill and sufficient alcohol to be intoxicated. (Tr. 53-54; SOR response) He went \nto a concert and argued with a spectator about seating. (Tr. 54; SOR response) Applicant \nwas ejected from the concert. He tried to reenter the concert, and he was arrested for \npublic intoxication. (Tr. 54-55) The police found the cocaine in his wallet and charged him \nwith cocaine possession. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant received pretrial diversion. (Tr. 45) He was \nrequired to complete 10 hours of community service, to attend drug education, and to \nsubmit to urinalysis tests once a month for six months.

(Tr. 48) He emphasized that he freely and \nvoluntarily disclosed his history of cocaine involvement and abuse of Xanax without being \nconfronted with information about his drug involvement by security officials. (Tr. 50-51) \nAlleged Falsification of SCAs \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant deliberately falsified material facts on his September \n8, 2016 SCA in Section 23, concerning illegal use of drugs or drug activity. His September \n8, 2016 SCA asked in the last seven years have you illegally used any controlled \nsubstance, for example, cocaine and crack cocaine? Applicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and did \nnot disclose his use of cocaine in 2013. \nIn his SOR response for the alleged falsification of his September 8, 2016 SCA, \nApplicant said he completed this SCA as part of a Military Entrance Processing Station \n(MEPS) process when he was joining the ARNG. (HE 2 at 3) The SCA was completed \nwith the help of a government representative who rapidly asked him questions. (Id.) He \nsaid, \u201cI can only speculate that being rushed through the questions may have caused me \nto overlook the single instance of illegal drug use (cocaine) from March 2013.\u201d (Id.)

(Id.) \nApplicant\u2019s description of the completion of his September 8, 2016 SCA at his \nhearing was consistent with his SOR response. (Tr. 36) In sum, the MEPS interviewer \nasked the questions so quickly he did not remember his single episode of cocaine use in \nMarch of 2013. (Tr. 37-38) He said he did not deliberately or intentionally fail to disclose \nthat cocaine use on the SCA he completed in 2016. (Tr. 38-39) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s January 17, 2022 SCA asked in the last seven \nyears have you illegally used any drugs or controlled substances, and have you ever \nillegally used or otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while \npossessing a security clearance? It also asked in the last seven years, have you \nintentionally engaged in the misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not \nthe drugs were prescribed for you or someone else? Applicant answered, \u201cNo,\u201d to these \nquestions, and he did not disclose his involvement with cocaine in May 2019 and Xanax \nin June 2019. \nIn his SOR response for the alleged falsification of his January 17, 2022 SCA, \nApplicant said he was in a hurry when he completed his SCA because he had to catch a \nflight. He said he completed his SCA before the trip, and he disclosed his history of \ncocaine use. (Tr. 40, 43) When he returned, he was required to complete the SCA, and \nhe erroneously believed the cocaine use was repopulated on the second SCA. (Tr. 40) \nThe information from the 2016 SCA may have partially repopulated on to the 2022 SCAs. \n(Tr. 41-42) He reviewed the SCA quickly and did not notice his history of cocaine use was \nnot on the second SCA. He forgot to disclose his Xanax use on both SCAs. (Tr. 40) His \nfailure to disclose his cocaine and Xanax use was \u201cdue to accidental oversight\u201d and not \ndeliberate; and he said he \u201cmade prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the falsification \nbefore being confronted with the facts.\u201d (HE 2 at 2) \nWhen Applicant completed his January 17, 2022 SCA, he included his arrest for \npublic intoxication and cocaine possession in June 2019. (GE 2 at 33) He said, \u201cI was \narrested for public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance (Cocaine less \nthan 1 gram). The cocaine offense was a felony, and the public intoxication was a \nmisdemeanor.\u201d (Id. at 34) These charges were dismissed and expunged. (Id. at 35; SOR \nresponse) When he had his follow-up OPM interview on April 14, 2023, he disclosed his \nuse of cocaine on four occasions, once in 2013 and three times in May 2019, and his use \nof Xanax in June 2019 before his arrest at the concert. (Tr. 43; GE 3-4 at 12-13) During \nhis hearing, he said he used cocaine a total of five time, once in 2013 and four times in \nMay 2019. (Tr. 33) \nCharacter Evidence \nOn March 17, 2023, and August 11, 2023, Applicant received achievement awards \nfrom his employer. (SOR response at 23; AE B) He also received a cash award for \nexceptional performance and an undated exceptional performance certificate.

(AE E; SOR response at 11-16) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.

Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern about drug involvement and substance \nmisuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance . . .\u201d; and \u201c(f) any illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d The record establishes \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(f). Further discussion of the disqualifying conditions and the \napplicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant possessed and used cocaine once in 2013 and four times in May 2019. \nCocaine is a Schedule II substance under the Controlled Substances Act. \u201cSchedule II \ndrugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a high potential for abuse, with \nuse potentially leading to severe psychological or physical dependence.\u201d Department of \nJustice, \nDrug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nwebsite, \nDrug \nScheduling, \nhttps://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling.

(Id.) \n\u201cSchedule IV drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with a low potential \nfor abuse and low risk of dependence.\u201d (Id.) Possession of cocaine and Xanax without a \nprescription are criminal offenses. He held a security clearance and a sensitive position \nin 2019 at the time he possessed and misused cocaine and Xanax. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant\u2019s possession and use of cocaine and Xanax \nin May and June 2019 are not recent. He promised not to use illegal drugs in the future. \nAs such, his cocaine and Xanax involvement \u201chappened under such circumstances that \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nit is unlikely to recur [and] does not cast doubt on [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, \n[and] good judgment.\u201d  \nApplicant has established his rehabilitation in the context of his drug abuse. He \nhas had a successful career as shown by his awards, certificates, and statements of \nsupport from coworkers. He understands the negative consequences for illegal drug \npossession and use, and he will not possess and use illegal drugs in the future. Drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) is established. Discussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe only criminal offenses are the offenses involving Applicant\u2019s abuse of Xanax, \ncocaine, and public intoxication. His most recent criminal offense was in June 2019, more \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthan four years ago; they are not recent; and they have low relevance to Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent status. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) apply for the same reasons discussed in the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse mitigation section, supra. Essentially, his overall duty \nperformance is sufficient to mitigate the instances of criminal conduct occurring in 2013 \nand 2019. Criminal conduct concerns are mitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides one personal conduct condition that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in relation to his provision of inaccurate information on \nhis SCA: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose on his September 8, 2016 and January 17, 2022 SCAs \nhis history of illegal possession and use of cocaine, and on his January 17, 2022 SCA his \nmisuse of Xanax. Applicant said he did not deliberately and intentionally provide false \ninformation in his SCAs. He hurried through the SCAs without carefully reviewing the final \nversion before signing it. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they [are] not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence.

When he completed his SCA in 2022, he was confused \nabout the information that was repopulating the SCA from a previous version. He \ndisclosed his June 2019 arrest for cocaine possession, which is an indication he was not \nattempting to conceal his history of drug involvement. When he had his follow-up OPM \ninterview on April 14, 2023, he disclosed his use of cocaine on four occasions, once in \n2013, and three times in May 2019, and his use of Xanax in June 2019 before his arrest \nat the concert. The OPM investigator did not confront Applicant with evidence of drug \ninvolvement before Applicant disclosed his history of involvement with cocaine and \nXanax. His disclosures to the OPM investigator were not prompt, because the disclosure \nwas not soon enough to qualify for this mitigating condition. However, Applicant was \ncandid and credible during his OPM interview, in his SOR response, and at his hearing. \nHe refuted the allegations that he intentionally falsified his SCAs. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old systems engineer. In 2020, he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in mechanical engineering. He served in the ARNG from 2016 to 2022. He held a \nsignal MOS, and he received an honorable discharge. He received a security clearance \nin 2016 as part of his ARNG service. \nApplicant was honest to the OPM investigator, in his SOR response, and at his \nhearing about his history of involvement with cocaine and Xanax. His possession and use \nof cocaine and Xanax without a prescription are not recent. He credibly promised not to \nmisuse drugs in the future.

There is no \nevidence of employment problems at his current employment. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a \nsecurity clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence has met his \nburden of establishing mitigation. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal \nconduct security concerns are refuted. Drug involvement and substance misuse and \ncriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The adjudicative guidelines applied in this matter \nwere issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective \nfor all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn March 27, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a \ndecision without a hearing. On May 11, 2023, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the \nDirective, Department Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a File of Relevant Material (FORM). The FORM contains four exhibits \n(Items 1 \u2013 4) on which the Government relies to support the factual allegations in the \nSOR. Applicant received the FORM on May 22, 2023, and was informed he had 30 days \nfrom the date of receipt to object to the use of the information included in the FORM and \nto submit additional information in response to the FORM. He did not submit any \nadditional information and he did not raise any objections to any of the Government\u2019s \nexhibits. The record closed on June 21, 2023, and I received the case for decision on \nSeptember 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the Government alleged that Applicant used marijuana \nbetween 1991 and at least February 2023 (SOR 1.a); that between 2015 and 2022, he \npurchased marijuana (SOR 1.b); that in October 2010, he used Vicodin without a \nprescription (SOR 1.c); and that in 1994, and between 2000 and 2007, he used \nmethamphetamine (SOR 1.f). \nIt is further alleged that in December 1994, he was arrested and charged with the \nsale or transportation of a controlled substance and possession of methamphetamine \n(SOR 1.j); that from 1993 to 1996, he sold cocaine (SOR 1.i); that in 1998, he was \narrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance for sale (SOR 1.h); that \nin 2007, he was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance and \nbeing under the influence of a controlled substance (SOR 1.g); and that in 2010, he was \narrested and charged with possession of a narcotic controlled substance (SOR 1.d). \nFinally, it was alleged that in 2009, he was ordered to undergo treatment for his drug use, \nwhich he failed to successfully complete (SOR 1.e). (FORM, Item 1) \nUnder Guideline E, the Government cross-alleged the Guideline H allegations \n(SOR 2.a). It also was alleged that Applicant intentionally made false official statements \nin response to questions in Section 22 (Police Record \u2013 EVER) of his August 2022 e-QIP \nby failing to list the facts alleged in SOR 1.d, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j (SOR 2.b).

(FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) After reviewing all of the available \ninformation, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a company contracted with the federal \ngovernment to perform duties in support of a military facility. He requires eligibility for a \npublic trust position to access his work location. He is a high school graduate, has never \nmarried, and has one child, now age 21. (FORM, Items 2 and 3) \nApplicant started using marijuana in 1991, when he was about 15 or 16 years old. \nAt times, he smoked as many as five joints a day. He reduced and eventually ceased his \nmarijuana use by September 2022, because he was trying to find work and knew he might \nhave to undergo urinalysis testing. In 2015, he started buying marijuana from medical \nmarijuana dispensaries in his home state, where personal possession and use of \nmarijuana has been legalized. Although he claims his use of marijuana has never caused \nhim personal or professional difficulties, in 2009, as alleged in SOR 1.e, a local child \nprotective services agency (CPS) ordered him to undergo rehabilitative drug treatment \nafter his then-8-year-old child made remarks about his drug use to someone at her school. \nBecause he did not complete the treatment, his daughter was placed in foster care and \neventually adopted. In his response to DOHA interrogatories on March 15, 2023, he \ndisclosed that he had last used marijuana a total of five times on two days in February \n2023, six months after he submitted his e-QIP. He also averred that he does not intend \nto use marijuana in the future. In his e-QIP, he did not list his failed drug treatment (as \nrequired by Section 23) because he \u2018did not want to relive it.\u201d He did not list his use of \nmarijuana (also as required by Section 23) because he does not believe marijuana use \nis a bad thing. (FORM, Items 2 and 3) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013 makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his \nstate of residence, is illegal. Further, illegal drug use is prohibited in all federal workplaces \nand on all military installations by civilian federal employees and by persons employed \nfor work on federal contracts. \nBetween 1994 and 2009, Applicant used and sold other federally controlled \nsubstances. Specifically, he sold, but did not use, cocaine from 1993 to 1996. He used \nmethamphetamine (crystal meth) in 1994 because a girl he liked used it. He also used \ncrystal meth between 2000 and 2007, again because his girlfriend used it. He used it daily \nbut decided to stop using it when he noticed it affected his thinking and gave him what he \nreferred to as a \u201dlight brain.\u201d (FORM, Items 1 and 3) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 1994 and charged with possession of crystal meth and \nwith possession of a controlled substance for sale. In 1996, he was sentenced to three \nyears\u2019 probation. During probation, he was required to undergo random urinalysis testing. \nTwice he tested positive for marijuana. After the second positive test, he was ordered to \ncomplete a drug rehabilitation program and his probation was restarted pending \ncompletion of the rehab program. He completed rehab in 1998 and probation in 1999. \nApplicant disclosed his arrest, rehab, and probation in his e-QIP. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) \nSOR 1.h alleges Applicant also was arrested in 1998 and charged with possession \nof a controlled substance for sale. In his PSI, he stated he did not remember such an \narrest and there is no information about a disposition of this charge. It is likely the entry \nin the FBI report is related to the 1996 conviction discussed above. SOR 1.h is resolved \nfor Applicant. (FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nApplicant was arrested in November 2007 and charged with possession, and being \nunder the influence, of a controlled substance (crystal meth). During a search incident to \na traffic stop, a plastic bag containing crystal meth residue was found in Applicant\u2019s \npocket. He acknowledged he had used crystal meth earlier that day but had forgotten to \nget rid of the bag. He spent three days in jail before the charges were dismissed. He did \nnot disclose this arrest because he viewed it as a minor event when compared to his 1994 \narrest. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) \nIn October 2010, Applicant used a pain reliever \u2013 Vicodin \u2013 without a prescription. \nUse of Vicodin requires a prescription because it is an opiate-based medication. \nApplicant\u2019s niece gave him three Vicodin pills after he developed a migraine headache. \nHe took one of the pills and kept the other two. Later in the day, a friend of his asked him \nif he had anything for a headache and Applicant traded one of the Vicodin pills for a single \ndose of Oxycontin, also a prescription pain reliever. On October 19, 2010, Applicant was \nstopped by police on suspicion of selling illegal drugs. A consensual search produced \nunprescribed Vicodin and Oxycontin in his possession. After a few days in jail, the charges \nwere dismissed. Applicant did not disclose this arrest in his e-QIP because he forgot about \nit. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) \nPolicies \nEligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is \n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to grant such access. Each \ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination based on examination \nof all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative guidelines. (See Directive, 6.3) \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. \nCommonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to sensitive information \nor protected facilities. This decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to sensitive information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke an applicant\u2019s eligibility. \nAdditionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate \nor mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a position of public \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531) \nA person who has access to sensitive or protected information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nunresolved doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for eligibility in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has purchased, possessed, used, and \nsold controlled substances on multiple occasions since 1991. He also has been arrested \nand charged with drug-related offenses at least three times over the past 19 years. \nAlthough he claims he will not use marijuana in the future, his use since he was a teenager \nhas been frequent and extensive, occurring most recently six months after he applied for \na position of trust and while working at a military installation. On two occasions, he was \nordered \u2013 first as a term of probation, then by CPS out of concern for the welfare of his \nminor child \u2013 to complete drug treatment. He twice tested positive for marijuana in the \nfirst instance and his probation was extended. In the second instance, he failed to \ncomplete the program and he lost custody of his daughter. This information reasonably \nraises a trustworthiness concern that is stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n(e) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical or mental health professional; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nI also have considered the following pertinent mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe Government\u2019s information constitutes sufficient evidence to support the SOR \nallegations and raise trustworthiness concerns under this guideline. It thus fell to Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto present information that warrants application of any pertinent mitigating conditions. In \nresponse, Applicant did not present information that would support any of the \naforementioned mitigating conditions. His claim that he will no longer use marijuana is \nundermined by the fact that his last known use of marijuana occurred well after he applied \nfor a position of trust, after he was interviewed about his drug involvement, and while he \nwas working for the sponsor of his application. While Applicant\u2019s marijuana use may be \nlegal under the laws of his state, it is still impermissible under federal controlled \nsubstances laws and DOD industrial security policy guidance. Applicant did not present \nany information in support of any of the pertinent AG \u00b6 26 mitigating conditions, and he \nhas not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns established by the Government\u2019s \ninformation. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Government\u2019s information reasonably raises the trustworthiness concern \nstated at AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nMore specifically, available information requires consideration of the following AG \n\u00b6 16 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nAs to AG \u00b6 16(c), SOR 2.a cross-alleges the conduct addressed under Guideline \nH, at SOR 1.a \u2013 1j. Because the Guideline H trustworthiness concerns are sufficient to \ndisqualify Applicant from a position of trust, AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply and SOR 2.a is \nresolved for Applicant. \nAs to AG \u00b6 16(a), Applicant omitted from his e-QIP his arrest for possession of \nVicodin and Oxycontin in 2010, because he forgot about that event. However, he omitted \nhis use of marijuana, because he does not regard the use of marijuana to be \u201ca bad thing.\u201d \nHe omitted his failed drug treatment in 2009 because he did not want to relive it. He \nomitted his 2007 arrest for possession of crystal meth because he deemed it a minor \nevent in comparison his 1994 arrest for possession and sale of a controlled substance. \nThe foregoing is sufficient to show that Applicant made conscious decisions to withhold \nfrom the government relevant, adverse information that would be material to an accurate \nassessment of his trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nI also considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully. \nThe Government\u2019s information constitutes sufficient evidence to support SOR 2.b \nand 2.c, and raises trustworthiness concerns under this guideline. Again, it fell to \nApplicant to present information sufficient to support application of any pertinent \nmitigating conditions. He did not present any such information and has not mitigated the \nconcerns about his trustworthiness that have been raised by his deliberate falsifications. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guidelines H and E, I have reviewed the record before me in \nthe context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Significant doubts about his \nsuitability for a position of public trust remain because of his extensive involvement with \nillegal drugs, and because of his willingness to falsify his answers to the government\u2019s \nnecessary and reasonable inquiries into his background. Because the protection of the \nnational interest is the principal goal of these adjudications, those doubts must be \nresolved against the Applicant. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g, 1.i \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b \u2013 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to sensitive information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that in January 2019, Applicant was discharged of his debts through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition he filed in September 2018 (SOR 1.a). It further alleged that he owed $7,735 for six past-due or delinquent debts (SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g). In response, he admitted each allegation (with comments), thus establishing them as facts. Based on my review of the information presented in the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. (FORM, Item 1) Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has worked since July 2022. He earned an associate degree in 2019, and he has taken other courses at a vocational and technical school. He and his wife have been married since 2004 and have three children under age 18. (FORM, Item 2) Applicant served on active duty and in the reserves between July 2004 and March 2012. He held a security clearance while in the military. In 2010, a reinvestigation of his eligibility for clearance showed that he was delinquent or past due on at least eight personal credit accounts. Based on his representations that he was receiving financial counseling and that he was paying or otherwise resolving his debts, adjudicators decided to renew his clearance on a conditional basis.

He did not \nmitigate the resulting security concerns about his finances. His request for eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 29, 2022, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for access to classified information \nrequired for his employment with a federal contractor. After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) \ncould not determine that it was clearly consistent with the interests of national security for \nApplicant to have access to classified information, as required by Executive Order 10865, \nas amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn April 24, 2023, the DOD sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nfacts and security concerns addressed under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken pursuant to and consistent with Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. On May 11, 2023, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) that Applicant received on May 18, 2023. The FORM \ncontained eight exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 8) on which the Government relies to support its case. \nApplicant was advised he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any \nof the Government\u2019s exhibits and to provide additional information in response to the \nFORM. He did not submit any additional information and he did not raise any objections \nto the Government\u2019s exhibits. The record closed on June 20, 2023, and I received the \ncase for decision on September 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that in January 2019, Applicant was \ndischarged of his debts through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition he filed in September \n2018 (SOR 1.a). It further alleged that he owed $7,735 for six past-due or delinquent \ndebts (SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g). In response, he admitted each allegation (with comments), thus \nestablishing them as facts. Based on my review of the information presented in the \nFORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. (FORM, Item 1) \nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked since July 2022. He earned an associate degree in 2019, and he has taken other \ncourses at a vocational and technical school. He and his wife have been married since \n2004 and have three children under age 18. (FORM, Item 2) \nApplicant served on active duty and in the reserves between July 2004 and March \n2012. He held a security clearance while in the military. In 2010, a reinvestigation of his \neligibility for clearance showed that he was delinquent or past due on at least eight \npersonal credit accounts. Based on his representations that he was receiving financial \ncounseling and that he was paying or otherwise resolving his debts, adjudicators decided \nto renew his clearance on a conditional basis. (FORM, Items 2, 3, 7, and 8) \nIn his July 2022 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that, as alleged in SOR 1.a, he was \ndischarged of his debts through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. As co-debtors, he and \nhis wife declared assets of $38,950 against liabilities totaling $117,840. Unsecured claims \nagainst them totaled $96,954. During the background investigation initiated when he \nsubmitted his e-QIP, investigators obtained a credit report that reflects the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR 1.b \u2013 1.g. Applicant discussed those debts with an investigator \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduring a personal subject interview (PSI) on November 29, 2022. During the PSI and in \nresponse to the SOR, he stated that his recent financial problems arose from a \ncombination of lost income during the COVID pandemic, brief periods of unemployment, \nand a few ill-advised financial decisions. He also acknowledged having financial problems \nwhile he was in the military, which he resolved by taking out a loan to pay his past-due \ndebts. As of his PSI, he reported after expenses having little remaining money each \nmonth, and he expressed a general intent to resolve his financial problems. In his April \n2023 response to the SOR, he stated that he either is on or is working to establish \nrepayment plans for his debts. He further claims to have reduced the $511 debt alleged \nat SOR 1.d to $297. He did not submit any corroborating documents in response to the \nGovernment\u2019s information. He has not received financial counseling since 2010. (FORM, \nItems 1, 2, 3, and 6) \nAfter leaving active duty in 2011, Applicant worked in a series of jobs before being \nhired by his current employer. Between 2013 and 2021, he was unemployed three times \nfor a total of 15 months, most recently between May 2020 and February 2021, due in \nlarge part to the COVID pandemic. During that time, he received benefit payments from \nthe government, which he used to pay rent and buy food. He has been continuously \nemployed since February 2021. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations: \nAvailable information supports the SOR allegations and reasonably raises the \nsecurity concern about finances stated at \u00b6 AG 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, this record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 19 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also have considered the following pertinent mitigating conditions available under \nAG \u00b6 20: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe information presented by the Government established a prima facie case for \ndisqualification of Applicant from access to classified information. Thus, it fell to Applicant \nto present information sufficient either to refute the SOR allegations or to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns established by the adverse information presented. He did not meet his \nburden of producing such information. Although he claims to have made payments on \nsome of his debts, and that he intends to establish repayment plans for others, he \npresented no information that would support those claims. He did not establish that his \nfinancial problems arose from circumstances either beyond his control or that are unlikely \nto recur. He has not produced a record of consistent payments or other actions that would \nshow a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. And while it appears he obtained counseling \nand assistance with his finances when his clearance was last reviewed in 2010, he has \nnot done so in response to his current financial problems. Although not alleged, the \ninformation about the 2010 adjudication is relevant to my assessment of possible \nmitigation under this guideline. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n16, 2017). \nApplicant did not present any reassuring information about his current personal \nfinances. The fact that he has begun to accrue delinquent debt less than five years after \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge does not inspire confidence that his financial problems \nare no longer a security concern. He did not mitigate the security concerns under this \nguideline. In addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Available information leaves \nunchanged the doubts raised about his judgment and reliability that have been raised by \nhis financial problems. Because the protection of the national interest is the principal goal \nof these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

Following his discharge, he was unemployed for a period and then planned to \nrelocate to another state (State 2). He knew that he could not afford to continue making \nthe monthly payments, and he voluntarily relinquished the vehicle. Also, he had access \nto another car in State 2. He mistakenly understood that returning the vehicle would \nsatisfy the debt on the loan. He found it \u201codd\u201d that the creditor kept sending him bills after \nthe repossession, but he figured that it would just take time to clear up the paperwork.

Applicant testified that the creditor is demanding the full \npayment of the balance on the loan after deducting the resale price for the vehicle \n($36,577), and that he has attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate a payment plan. His \nlast conversation with the creditor was in January 2023, about six months prior to the \nhearing.

(AE A through AE C.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant owed approximately $62,000 for the 13 alleged \ndelinquent debts. The Government\u2019s credit reports in the record and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in the Answer establish the existence of these debts and the application of \nthe above potentially disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto mitigate security concerns under Guideline F. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nSome of the debts set forth in the SOR are routine debts that did not arise under \nany unusual circumstances other than Applicant\u2019s lack of attention to his financial affairs. \nOther debts arose under the unusual and difficult circumstances of Applicant\u2019s separation \nfrom his wife, and during his unemployment following his discharge from the USMC. \nThese circumstances largely beyond his control. His management of those debts, \nspecifically SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h, however, was not responsible. He did not use \nsufficient diligence to understand that he had a substantial debt to pay after the voluntary \nrepossession of a vehicle, and once he learned about that debt, he did not take \nresponsible steps to begin to resolve it. The two other debts arose from his wife\u2019s actions \nbreaking a lease and defaulting on a car loan. Applicant was not directly the reason why \nthese delinquencies arose, but as a co-obligor on both debts, he was fully obliged to pay \nthem. He has not taken responsible actions to resolve them. He has not pursued a divorce \nor marital separation agreement to work out a resolution of his responsibility for the debts \nor parts of the debts. He merely ignored them and has moved onto a new relationship \nand started a new family. Applicant\u2019s inaction and failure to address his marital debts, \neither directly with creditors or through a marital separation agreement or divorce, does \nnot demonstrate the good judgment and responsibility of one entrusted to safeguard \nsensitive information. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s behavior casts doubt on his reliability, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment.

Although he has resolved ten \nof his delinquent debts totaling about $2,900, he does not have the remaining three debts \nunder control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. \nApplicant has initiated a good-faith effort to repay ten of the debts set forth in the \nSOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.g and 1.i through 1.m), but he has not made a good-faith effort \nwith respect to his three largest debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h), which total about \n$59,000. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. \nLastly, AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable because Applicant does not dispute any of his \nalleged unpaid debts. With respect to his marital debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.h, he only \ndisagrees with his wife as to who should pay them and how much he should pay. Overall, \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all pertinent facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have given significant weight to Applicant\u2019s service \nto the U.S. Government as a Marine and as a government contractor. I have also given \nweight to the character evidence provided by Applicant and to the difficulties raised by his \nunemployment following his military discharge. However, his inaction regarding his three \nlargest debts shows that he lacks the maturity for national security eligibility.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 59 years old. She graduated from high school in 1982. From August 1987 to December 2020, she was employed full time as a financial management analyst for the DOD. She has also been employed full time as direct-support personnel for an in- home health care company since April 2008. Her June 2022 security clearance application is sponsored by a DOD contractor; however, it is unclear whether she has started employment there. She has been married since August 1985, and she has three adult children. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 8) On June 23, 2022, Applicant certified and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In the e-QIP, she reported that she owed approximately $60,000 in delinquent state taxes and that she had not filed state income tax returns for at least one tax year (TY). She also reported that she owed approximately $90,000 in past-due Federal income taxes. (GE 2) On August 18, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator. During the interview, Applicant attributed her financial delinquencies to her reduced hours of employment during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also referenced reduced income in 2013 due to illness and insufficient sick leave, resulting in her 2014 bankruptcy filing (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). Applicant explained that she was currently paying $840 a month on her delinquent state income taxes and that she had been paying the IRS $850 a month on her delinquent Federal taxes until she retired (December 2020).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 22, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (financial considerations). The CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn Applicant's April 3, 2023 response to the SOR (Answer), she admitted all of the \nallegations except SOR \u00b6 1.b.

(Answer) \nOn April 27, 2023, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM) and provided a complete copy to Applicant. Department Counsel's FORM \nincludes Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11. GE 3 consists, in part, of the summary \nof an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \nconducted on August 18, 2022. In the FORM, Department Counsel provided Applicant \nnotice that failure to respond to the FORM may be considered a waiver of any objections \nto the admissibility of GE 3. \nOn May 5, 2023, Applicant received the FORM and its attachments. She did not \nsubmit a response to the FORM within 30 days of receipt. She did not raise any objections \nto the admissibility of GE 3 or dispute any of the contents of the interview summary. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 14, 2023. GE 1 through 11 are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 59 years old. She graduated from high school in 1982. From August \n1987 to December 2020, she was employed full time as a financial management analyst \nfor the DOD. She has also been employed full time as direct-support personnel for an in-\nhome health care company since April 2008. Her June 2022 security clearance application \nis sponsored by a DOD contractor; however, it is unclear whether she has started \nemployment there. She has been married since August 1985, and she has three adult \nchildren. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 8) \nOn June 23, 2022, Applicant certified and submitted an Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP). In the e-QIP, she reported that she owed \napproximately $60,000 in delinquent state taxes and that she had not filed state income \ntax returns for at least one tax year (TY). She also reported that she owed approximately \n$90,000 in past-due Federal income taxes. (GE 2) \nOn August 18, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator. During \nthe interview, Applicant attributed her financial delinquencies to her reduced hours of \nemployment during the COVID-19 pandemic. She also referenced reduced income in \n2013 due to illness and insufficient sick leave, resulting in her 2014 bankruptcy filing (SOR \n\u00b6 1.a.). Applicant explained that she was currently paying $840 a month on her delinquent \nstate income taxes and that she had been paying the IRS $850 a month on her delinquent \nFederal taxes until she retired (December 2020). She claimed to have been enrolled in a \ndebt-resolution program for about two years. (GE 3; GE 6) \nApplicant provided the OPM investigator several documents.

An undated letter from a taxpayer-relief \ncompany claimed that the company had prepared Applicant's tax returns for TY 2010 \nthrough 2019 and had calculated her delinquent taxes at approximately $104,412. The \nmissing returns were not provided. Applicant also provided the OPM investigator with four \ninstallment plans from a state tax authority, stating Applicant owed approximately $61,463 \nas of June 27, 2022. (GE 3) \nBankruptcy Filings  \nApplicant previously filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in June 1992. The \ndischargeable debts were discharged in November 1992. This bankruptcy petition is not \nalleged and will not be considered as disqualifying conduct; however, it is relevant when \nevaluating Applicant's evidence in mitigation. (GE 7) \nOn March 11, 2014, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). \nA summary of schedules lists $270,811 in liabilities. She reported owing approximately \n$100,000 to the IRS for TY 1995 through TY 2014 and owing $7,000 to the state tax \nauthority for TY 2007 through TY 2014. Applicant completed the credit counseling course \nrequired by the bankruptcy case. (GE 8) \nFederal Income T\n axes  \nIn her Answer, Applicant denied that she failed to file her Federal income tax \nreturns for TY 2010 through 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). In her e-QIP, she indicated that she owed \ndelinquent Federal and state taxes, and she listed the date of 2014 for when her issues \nwith her Federal income taxes began. There is no evidence to establish that she failed to \nfile her Federal income tax returns for TY 2010 through 2014. \nApplicant admitted that she owed delinquent Federal taxes, interest, and penalties \n- totaling approximately $68,936 - for TY 2015 through 2019. During her August 2022 \nsecurity interview, she indicated that she had established a repayment plan with the IRS, \nbut she had discontinued the plan upon her retirement in December 2020. There is no \ndocumentary evidence of any payments on Applicant's delinquent Federal taxes. \n(Answer; GE 3) \nFor TY 2015, Applicant filed her Federal income tax return on June 1, 2016. As of \nNovember 23, 2022, she owed approximately $28,002.99 in delinquent taxes, interest, \nand penalties (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). Although a payment plan was established in September 2021, \nthere is no evidence of payments made. (GE 4)  \nFor TY 2016, Applicant filed her Federal income tax return on September 25, 2017. \nAs of November 23, 2022, she owed approximately $24,340.30 in delinquent taxes, \ninterest, and penalties (SOR \u00b6 1.d.). Although a payment plan w\n \nas established in \nSeptember 2021, there is no evidence of any payments made.

Although a payment plan had been established in September 2021, there \nis no evidence of any payments made since the return was filed in April 2018. (GE 4) \nFor TY 2018, Applicant filed her Federal income tax return on May 18, 2020. As of \nNovember 23, 2022, she owed approximately $12,483.75 in delinquent taxes, interest, \nand penalties (SOR \u00b6 1.f.). Although a payment plan had been established in September \n2021, there is no evidence of any payments made. (GE 4)  \nFor TY 2019, Applicant filed her Federal income tax return on March 9, 2021. As \nof November 23, 2022, she owed approximately $2,361 in delinquent taxes, interest, and \npenalties (SOR \u00b6 1.g.). Although a payment plan was established in November 2021, \nthere is no evidence of any payments made. (GE 4) \nOn January 15, 2009, a Federal tax lien was filed against Applicant in the \napproximate amount of $76,057. Although this tax lien was not alleged and will not be \nconsidered as disqualifying conduct, it is relevant in evaluating Applicant's evidence in \nmitigation. (GE 9) \nState Tax L\n iens  \nApplicant admitted the four alleged state tax liens (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h.-1.k.), totaling \napproximately $61,718, filed between September 2017 and October 2019. Although \nApplicant claimed to have established a payment plan and made payments on these \ndelinquent taxes, there is no documentary evidence to corroborate her claims. (Answer; \nGE 3; GE 10) \nConsumer Accounts  \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. This account became delinquent in about February 2022.

This account was opened in September 2021 and became delinquent \nin December 2021. As of April 2023, this account was past due in the approximate amount \nof $3,663. There is no evidence of any payment plan or payments to resolve this \ndelinquent debt. (GE 6) \nApplicant did not provide any information about her monthly income and expenses. \nThere is no information about when she enrolled in the debt-relief program or whether she \nestablished a payment plan and made payments on her delinquent accounts. There is no \nevidence of any credit counseling since her 2014 bankruptcy. Applicant has not explained \nwhy she has failed to pay her Federal and state income taxes for so many years. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant's eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge's overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\"whole-person concept.\" The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \"[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\" The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \"in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\" See also EO 12968, Section 3.1 (b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can false \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nIn March 2014, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition, listing \napproximately $270,000 in liabilities, including approximately $107,000 in delinquent \ntaxes. In her Answer, Applicant admitted owing delinquent Federal income taxes for TY \n2015 through 2019, totaling approximately $68,936, and state tax liens totaling \napproximately $61,718. Lastly, she admitted two delinquent consumer accounts, totaling \napproximately $4,698. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) apply. \nThe Government did not establish that Applicant failed to file her Federal income \ntax returns for TY 2010 through TY 2014. SOR \u00b6 1.b. is found for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe per\n \nson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by\n \n predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his debt-resolution efforts or required to \nbe debt-free. \"Rather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n'concomitant conduct,' that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\" ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nAlthough Applicant attributed her financial problems to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nher tax and financial problems began many years before the pandemic. Applicant's 2014 \nbankruptcy filing shows that her Federal and state delinquent taxes date back to 1995. \nApplicant's 1992 bankruptcy filing further supports the conclusion that her financial \nproblems have persisted for decades. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must establish \ncircumstances largely beyond her control, ---\nand that she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant's numerous tax problems predate the pandemic and she has \nnot demonstrated that she has acted responsibly to address and resolve her financial and \ntax delinquencies, so neither prong applies. She has admitted her delinquent Federal and \nstate taxes and her two delinquent consumer accounts; however, she has not established \ncurrent payment plans and payments in furtherance of these plans. There is no \ninformation about Applicant's monthly income and expenses and no evidence of credit \ncounseling since her 2014 bankruptcy. None of the financial considerations mitigating \nconditions apply. Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant's eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant's \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n____________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant's tax and financial problems have persisted for decades, and there is no \nevidence of current repayment plans or payments made for her Federal taxes, state taxes, \nor consumer debts. She has not demonstrated that she has acted responsibly to address \nand resolve her financial delinquencies. Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT   \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \nSubparagraphs 1.c.-1.m.: \nAgainst Applicant  \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, or partially admitted, with brief comments, all the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). He denied the personal conduct allegation with brief comments. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a ramp operations technician with his current sponsor since July 2022.

(Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on June 7, 2023, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on June 17, 2023. His response was due on July 17, 2023. Applicant chose \nnot to respond to the FORM, for as of September 28, 2023, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on September 28, 2023. The record closed on \nJuly 17, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, or partially admitted, with brief \ncomments, all the SOR allegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.c.). He denied the personal conduct allegation with brief comments. (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a ramp operations technician with his current sponsor since July 2022. He previously \nserved as a truck driver (August 2021 \u2013 July 2022), a transportation coordinator (January \n2021 \u2013 August 2021), a mission performance analyst (September 2019 \u2013 January 2021 \nand October 2018 \u2013 September 2019), military operations analyst staff (July 2017 \u2013 \nOctober 2018), military operations analyst (June 2016 \u2013 June 2017), and senior load \nplanner (February 2015 \u2013 May 2016). an able seaman with another employer from \nFebruary 2003 until December 2007. He has never served with the U.S. military. He was \ngranted a security clearance at an unspecified level either in 2002 or 2004 until 2008, but \nhe no longer has that clearance. He was married in 2001 and divorced in 2011; remarried \nin 2015 and separated in 2018; and he currently cohabits since 2018. He has four \nchildren, born in 1998, 2000, 2013, and 2016. \nFinancial Considerations  \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: Item 7 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEquifax Credit Report, dated April 5, 2019); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated \nNovember 4, 2019); Item 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated November 16, 2020); Item 4 \n(Equifax Credit Report, dated July 1, 2021); and Item 9 (Enhanced Subject Interview, \ndated May 7, 2019). \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on May 7, 2019. During that interview, he acknowledged, for the first \ntime, that he had had repossessions; had defaulted on loans; had bills turned over to \ncollections; had accounts suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failure to pay; had \nbeen evicted for non-payment; had wage benefits or assets garnished; and had been \nover 120 days delinquent on any debt. Despite being offered the opportunity to furnish \nspecifics regarding those issues, he was unable, or chose not, to do so. (Item, 9, at 6) \nUpon being confronted with specific accounts, he finally became more open about his \naccounts and described the reasons for his financial difficulties. Because of an oil spill in \n2012, his income decreased $20,000 per year. He did not give any additional information \nregarding the specific oil spill, how it impacted his employer, or why his salary was \nreduced. He claimed that he intended to resolve the delinquent account when he is able \nto do so because, as of the date of the interview, he was still suffering from the decreased \nincome. (Item 9, at 7) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant added: \nDue to the uncertainty and ups and downs of the oil and gas industry, I \nreceived a $50,000 pay cut that caused a massive financial strain on my \nfinances. But during the past year, I have been working on settling my debts. \nI have made repayment agreements with several of these creditors, and I \nam working on resolving these matters. \n(Item 2, at 5) \nHe failed to explain how his salary loss increased from $20,000 to $50,000; to \nspecify with which creditors he had engaged; which accounts had repayment \nagreements; whether he had made any payments; or if any accounts had been settled or \notherwise resolved. He offered no documentation, such as repayment agreements, \nstatements from creditors, receipts, or cancelled checks, to support his claims. \nThe SOR alleged 17 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $56,439, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. is an unspecified type of account with what appears to be a residential \ncomplex with an unpaid balance of $4,887 that was placed for collection. Although the \naccount was in dispute, no reason was indicated for the dispute. (Item 7, at 11; Item 6, at \n2; Item 5, at 2) The account has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. is a cellular phone account with an unpaid balance of $3,649 that was \nplaced for collection. It was charged off in February 2019.

He did not report his net monthly income, his \nmonthly household expenses, or any monthly debt payments. In the absence of such \ninformation, I am unable to determine if he has any monthly remainder available for \nsavings or spending. There is a paucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems \nare now under control, and it is difficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better \nposition financially than he had been. \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. \u2013 Applicant failed to register, as required by law, for the Selective \nService. In his SF 86, during his OPM interview, and in his Answer to the SOR, he claimed \nhe was unaware that doing so was a requirement, or he did not know how or where to \nregister. (Item 2, at 3, 5; Item 3, at 14; Item 9, at 4) There is no provision to enable him to \nregister after the age of 26. \nThe registration requirement is set forth in 50 U.S.C. 3802: \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter it shall be the duty of every \nmale citizen of the United States, and every other male person residing in \nthe United States, who, on the day or days fixed for the first or any \nsubsequent registration, is between the ages of eighteen and twenty-six, to \npresent himself for and submit to registration at such time or times and place \nor places, and in such manner, as shall be determined by proclamation of \nthe President and by rules and regulations prescribed hereunder. The \nprovisions of this section shall not be applicable to any alien lawfully \nadmitted to the United States as a nonimmigrant under section 1101(a)(15) \nof title 8, for so long as he continues to maintain a lawful nonimmigrant \nstatus in the United States. \n(b) Regulations prescribed pursuant to subsection (a) may require that \npersons presenting themselves for and submitting to registration under this \nsection provide, as part of such registration, such identifying information \n(including date of birth, address, and social security account number) as \nsuch regulations may prescribe. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(June 24, 1948, Ch. 625, title I, \u00a73, 62 Stat. 605 ; June 19, 1951, Ch. 144, title I, \u00a71(c), 65 \nStat. 76 ; Pub.

Persons who are required to be registered and who are in the \nUnited States shall register at the places and by the means designated by \nthe Director of Selective Service. These places and means may include but \nare not limited to any classified United States Post Office, the Selective \nService Internet web site, telephonic registration, registration on approved \nGovernment forms, registration through high school and college registrars, \nand the Selective Service reminder mail back card. \n1\u2013202. Citizens of the United States who are required to be registered \nand who are not in the United States, shall register via any of the places \nand methods authorized by the Director of Selective Service pursuant to \nparagraph 1\u2013201 or present themselves at a United States Embassy or \nConsulate for registration before a diplomatic or consular officer of the \nUnited States or before a registrar duly appointed by a diplomatic or \nconsular officer of the United States. \n1\u2013203. The hours for registration in United States Post Offices shall be \nthe business hours during the days of operation of the particular United \nStates Post Office. The hours for registration in United States Embassies \nand Consulates shall be those prescribed by the United States Embassies \nand Consulates. \n1\u2013301. Persons who are required to be registered shall comply with the \nregistration procedures and other rules and regulations prescribed by the \nDirector of Selective Service. \n1\u2013302. When reporting for registration each person shall present for \ninspection reasonable evidence of his identity. After registration, each \nperson shall keep the Selective Service System informed of his current \naddress. \nUnder 50 U.S.C 3811(g), any individual who failed to timely register, may not be \ndenied any federal right or benefit if he can show by a preponderance of evidence (e.g. \nmore-likely-than-not) that his failure to register was not knowing and willful. By simply \nstating he was unaware that registering was a requirement, or he did not know how or \nwhere to register, without more, does not meet that preponderance of evidence standard. \n(https://www.sss.gov/register/men-26-and-older/) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. \u2013 On March 19, 2019, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he \nresponded to questions pertaining to his financial record.

He answered \u201cno\u201d to those questions. He certified that the \nresponses were \u201ctrue, complete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but \nthe responses to those questions were, in fact, incorrect for at that time Applicant had \nseveral accounts that fell within the stated parameters.  \nDuring his OPM interview, after being confronted with information regarding \nspecific delinquent accounts, he acknowledged the existence of those accounts, and he \nstated that his omissions were due to oversight, not otherwise explained. (Item 9) In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation, but added: \nAt the time of submitting my answers, I was working towards paying off my \ndebts and at the time, I didn\u2019t recall having accounts, such as credit cards, \nthat were 120 days past due. I answered every question to the best of my \nknowledge and didn\u2019t deliberately falsify my answers. \n(Item 2, at 5) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. \u2013 On the same day, Applicant also responded to questions pertaining \nto his police record. Several of those questions in Section 22 \u2013 Police Record \u2013 asked if \nhe had \u201cEVER\u201d been charged with any felony offense; or been charged with an offense \ninvolving firearms or explosives; or been charged with an offense involving alcohol or \ndrugs. He answered \u201cno\u201d to those questions. He certified that the responses were \u201ctrue, \ncomplete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but the responses to those \nquestions were, in fact, false. In September 1996, at the age of 17, he was charged with: \n(1) carrying a concealed weapon, a misdemeanor; and (2) possession of marijuana, a \nmisdemeanor. He was sentenced to probation for three months, and ordered to perform \ncommunity service. (Item 8, at 4-5; Item 9, at 6) In December 1996 (as opposed to \nFebruary 1996, as erroneously alleged in the SOR), he was charged with damage to \nproperty and criminal mischief, a felony. The charge was eventually dropped or \nabandoned by the prosecutor. (Item 8, at 5-6; Item 9, at 5-6) He told the OPM investigator \nthat he did not list this information due to oversight. (Item 9, at 6)  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation, but added: \nI have never deliberately withheld any information. I\u2019ve answered the above \nquestions to the best of my knowledge without having a report to reference. \nI was a teen when this incident took place, and I didn\u2019t really remember the \noutcome. I\u2019ve answered these questions exactly as I did when I held a \nclearance from 2004 to 2008.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nThe SOR alleged 17 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $56,439. \nApplicant attributed his inability to maintain those accounts in a current status to an oil \nspill in 2012, which led to a massive financial strain on his finances due to a reduction of \nhis annual salary by either $20,000 or $50,000, depending on when he described the \nsituation. In May 2019, he described his overall financial situation as merely \u201cok.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is no evidence that Applicant has been \nunwilling to satisfy his debts regardless of an ability to do so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not \nbeen established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other conditions apply. A debt that \nbecame delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be \nviewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. \nSept. 13, 2016)). He apparently disputed several of the accounts, but failed to furnish any \nreasonable basis to do so. Applicant\u2019s references to an otherwise unexplained oil spill; \nand references to a substantial loss of wages without describing his actual income during \nthe period 2012 through 2021, raise the possibility of a business downturn that might have \nbeen largely beyond his control. But, without more information, it is impossible to \ndetermine what the financial impact may have been.

He offered no documentary evidence to support any \ncontentions that resolution efforts had been made. Because of his failure to confirm \npayment of even his smallest delinquent accounts (a $89 medical account and a $98 \ncellular phone account) and his failure to furnish documentation regarding any of the \naccounts, the overwhelming evidence leads to the conclusion that his financial problems \nare not under control. He has not acted responsibly by failing to address his delinquent \naccounts while employed and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with his \ncreditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any evidence that he has even begun making such efforts \neven after the SOR was issued in March 2021. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant offered no specifics \nregarding any repayment plan; submitted no documentary evidence to reflect any \npayments made; and only made promises of proposed actions. Not one delinquent debt \nhas been resolved. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties, and his \ngeneral failure to voluntarily and timely start to resolve them until substantial investigatory \naction was taken, is sufficient to conclude that his financial difficulties were not infrequent. \nThe timeliness of his efforts to resolve his debts is not good, and the delay in commencing \nto do so, is another negative factor. The subsequent positive and successful efforts are \ngood. However, the source of the funds he used to resolve his delinquent accounts is still \nshrouded in mystery. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling, a budget, or current financial \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s delayed, if not non-existent, actions under the circumstances cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. \n09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe guideline notes two conditions that could raise security concerns. Under AG \u00b6 \n16, it is potentially disqualifying if there is: \n(a) a deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nWith respect to the alleged omissions, concealments, or falsifications on March 19, \n2019, when Applicant completed his SF 86, he responded to certain questions pertaining \nto his financial record (concerning delinquent debts, collection activities, credit card \nsuspensions, etc.) and police record (felony arrests or charges involving firearms or \ndrugs). He answered \u201cno\u201d to those questions. He certified that the responses were \u201ctrue, \ncomplete, and correct\u201d to the best of his knowledge and belief, but the responses to those \nquestions were, in fact, incorrect for at that time Applicant had several accounts, as well \nas one arrest, that fell within the stated parameters. As noted above, in his Answer to the \nSOR, although he admitted the two allegations, he claimed that the incorrect answers \nwere due to oversight, and that he did not deliberately falsify his answers. \nApplicant\u2019s responses provide sufficient evidence to examine if his submissions \nwere deliberate falsifications, as alleged in the SOR, or merely the result of \nmisunderstanding of the true facts. I have considered the very limited available \ninformation pertaining to Appellant\u2019s background and professional career, and his \nseemingly superficial understanding of his financial matters, in analyzing his actions. \nProof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or \nstate of mind when the falsification or omission occurred. As an administrative judge, I \nmust consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning Appellant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nfalsification or omission occurred. The Appeal Board has explained the process for \nanalyzing falsification cases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred.  \nISCR Case No. 03-10390 at 8 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)). \nWhile there may have been some confusion in Applicant\u2019s mind regarding his \npolice record regarding an incident that occurred over 20 years ago, his admission as to \nthe financial record is unambiguous (he knew the accounts existed, but he was working \ntowards paying them off at the time).  Nevertheless, AG \u00b6 16(a) has been established. \n13 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s failure to register, as required by law, for the Selective \nService before the age of 26, it is unchallenged, and AG \u00b6 16(d) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) partially applies to the allegation regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to register \nfor the Selective Service \u2013 something he was required to do no later than 2004 \u2013 because \nhe was candid when he submitted his SF 86. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) also applies to the police record, \nbut not to the finance record. As noted above, over two decades ago, when he was a \nminor, Applicant was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon, a \nmisdemeanor; and possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor. He was sentenced to \nprobation for three months, and ordered to perform community service. That same year, \nhe was charged with damage to property and criminal mischief, a felony. The charge was \neventually dropped or abandoned by the prosecutor. He did not admit that his intention \nwas to falsify, omit, or conceal the police-related information. Over two years have passed \nsince Applicant completed the SF 86, and he has not been involved in any more recent \npersonal conduct issues. His responses to the police record questions were about an \nisolated incident two decades earlier. Substantial periods of time have passed since the \nincident occurred and the SF 86 was completed. While Applicant\u2019s financial record \nresponse was made at the same time, the issues related to his finances continue to this \nday, so they are considered more significant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nHe is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \u201cbosun\u201d \n\u2013 a merchant mariner \u2013  with his current sponsor since September 2008. He previously \nserved as an able seaman with another employer from February 2003 until December \n2007. He was granted a security clearance at an unspecified level either in 2002 or 2004 \nuntil 2008, but he no longer has that clearance.   \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant omitted, concealed, or falsified his financial history \nin his SF 86. He failed to timely register with the Selective Service before he turned 26. \nHe has 17 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $56,439. Although he claimed \nthat during the year preceding his Answer to the SOR he had been working on settling \nhis debts; had made repayment agreements with several of the creditors; and was \nworking on resolving the matters; he offered no documentary evidence of a good-faith \neffort to support any of those claims, and he did not identify with which creditors he had \nany resolution discussions. \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s failure to confirm payment of even his smallest delinquent \naccounts (a $89 medical account and a $98 cellular phone account) and his failure to \nfurnish documentation regarding any of the accounts, the overwhelming evidence leads \nto the conclusion that his financial problems are not under control. He has not acted \nresponsibly by failing to address his delinquent accounts while employed and by failing \nto make limited, if any, efforts of working with his creditors. There are lingering questions \nif Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had been, as well as \ncontinuing doubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, and the \nlengthy period of non-contact with his creditors, is negative and disappointing. Overall, \nthe evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial considerations and \npersonal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.q.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a. and 2.b.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n16 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 35, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, since October 2021. He completed a security clearance application, his first, in July 2022. He did not disclose any derogatory information. The investigation revealed several delinquent debts. The SOR alleges that Applicant owed $48,271 on seven delinquent accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g). He admits to owing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g and denies owing SOR \u00b6 1.a because it is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.b. (GE 4) Applicant cites two events as the genesis of his financial problems. In 2018, he and his long-time partner, who is the mother of two of his three children, ended their relationship.

He completed a security clearance application, his first, in July 2022. He \ndid not disclose any derogatory information. The investigation revealed several \ndelinquent debts. The SOR alleges that Applicant owed $48,271 on seven delinquent \naccounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g). He admits to owing SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g and \ndenies owing SOR \u00b6 1.a because it is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.b.

He moved out of the home they shared. She kept the couple\u2019s joint assets, \nincluding their cash savings. He also began paying child support. In 2021, he \nexperienced a decreased income related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Between \nNovember 2010 and October 2021, Applicant worked full time for a nationally-known \nretailer. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, he earned his base salary and overtime, which \nhe had come to rely on to meet his financial obligations. At some point during the \npandemic, the employer suspended operations but continued play their employees their \nbase salaries. The alleged debts became delinquent between January 2019 and June \n2021. Applicant began his current job in October 2021. He continues to work part time \nwith his previous employer. In his response to the FORM, he indicated that his base \nsalary is higher in his new position but did not disclose his annual salary in either \nposition. (GE 4,8) \nAlso, in his June 2023 response to the FORM, Applicant argues that SOR \u00b6 1.a \n($13,294) is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.b ($11,690). This assertion is not supported by the \nrecord. The credit reports in the record, GE 5 and 6, identify these debts as different \naccounts. Furthermore, in his August 2022 subject interview, Applicant told the \ninvestigator that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($13,294) was for the deficiency balance \non a loan for a repossessed vehicle. He has made no plans to resolve this debt. He \nreported that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was for a signature loan. (GE 8, AE A, D) \nApplicant provided documentation showing that he settled the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($5,774); 1.e ($1,236); and 1.f ($1,124) for less than the amounts owed. He \nhas agreed to resolve the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($11,690) with $25 monthly \npayments until the debt is resolved.

Nor did he provide a personal financial statement or budget, detailing his \ncurrently monthly income and expenses. He believes that his financial position is \nimproving. In his April 2023 Answer to the SOR, he explained that because he was \nrepaying a loan against his retirement account, he could not afford to pay the debts \nalleged in the SOR. After he completed paying the loan in May 2023, he planned to take \nout another loan so that he could file for bankruptcy protection. There is no indication \nthat he has executed that plan. (Answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). Here, the SOR alleges and the record supports a \nfinding that Applicant is indebted to six creditors for $48,271. The Government has \nestablished it\u2019s prima facie case that certain of the financial considerations apply, \nspecifically: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are partially applicable, but do not fully mitigate the \nalleged concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of unemployment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and, \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by the end of a long-term relationship \nin 2018, compounded by the the economic effects of a global pandemic between 2020 \nand 2021. Although his base income did not decrease, he lost the ability to earn \novertime, on which he previously relied to meet his financial obligations, results in the \naccumulation of delinquent debt. \nAfter the SOR issued in March 2023 and he received the FORM in May 2023, \nApplicant began to contact his creditors to make payment arrangements for the alleged \ndebts. He settled the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f and arranged payment \nplans for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d. He began earning more than his pre-pandemic income in \nOctober 2021. The record does not contain an explanation as to why he waited almost \ntwo years to address his delinquent debts. Furthermore, there is insufficient information \nin the record to establish that he can honor the payment arrangements with his \ncreditors. The record does not contain information about his currently income, \nexpenses, or discretionary income. He did not establish a history of debt repayment to \nestablish that he is more likely than not to continue paying on these debts in the future. \nHe has not made any plans to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($13,294) and \n1.g ($11,238). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s current security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt-collection proceedings. The \nAGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each and every debt \nalleged in the SOR, to be debt free, or to resolve first the debts alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. He has not done so. Applicant has not \nestablished the necessary track record of debt repayment necessary to mitigate the \nconcerns alleged in the SOR. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.c, 1.e, 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a, 1.b. 1.d, 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse under AG \u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe record evidence shows Applicant has a long history of habitual marijuana use \nfrom March 2018 to February 2023. He also admits to purchasing marijuana on numerous \noccasions. He also admits to using hallucinogenic mushrooms on one occasion and LSD \non two occasions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014, memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state \nlaw (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the \nnational security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of federal law \nconcerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making \neligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15) An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, \n2005)) \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence on actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: 1. Disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 2. \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and 3. \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant has used marijuana on a semi-\nregular basis since 2018. Applicant was initially unaware that medical marijuana remained \nillegal under federal law even if it is legalized under state law.  However, he continued to \nuse marijuana until at least February 2023, after being informed that marijuana remains \nillegal under federal law during his October 2022 background investigation interview. \nWhile Applicant expressed an intent to not use marijuana in the future, he was not willing \nto provide a signed statement of intent to refrain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse. His failure to do so, makes his expressed intention not to use marijuana in the \nfuture less persuasive. Applicant did not mitigate the concerns under Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \nApplicant illegally used marijuana on many occasions since 2018. He last used \nmarijuana in February 2023, less than one year ago. Applicant\u2019s continued regular use of \nmarijuana after being made aware that it remained illegal under federal law makes his \nintentions to discontinue marijuana use in the future questionable, especially since he \ndeclined to provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement when \ngiven the opportunity to do so. Applicant\u2019s history of poly-substance abuse raises \nquestions about his trustworthiness and reliability. Overall, I conclude the concerns under \nDrug Involvement and Substance Abuse are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nErin C. Hogan \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Under Section 26 (Delinquency \nInvolving Routine Accounts), he reported a delinquent mortgage account from 2017, \nwhich he resolved in 2018. He listed no other delinquent accounts. (GE 1) \nOn November 11, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator \non behalf of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that he separated \nfrom his wife in 2017. While separated, Applicant paid his estranged wife $1,300 in \nmonthly spousal support and $1,000 in monthly child support. At the time, his monthly \nincome was approximately $3,200. When the divorce was finalized in 2018, Applicant \nassumed all of the marital debt. During the interview, Applicant admitted the 12 debts, and \nhe stated that he was not engaged in any payment arrangements or making payments at \nthat time.

As of the hearing, this debt was enrolled in the DRP with a \npayment agreement in place; however, there is no evidence of any payments between \n2017 and mid-2023. (GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 5; Tr. 61-62; AE B) \nIn May 2023, Applicant enrolled ten debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.-1.c., 1.e.-1.j., and 1.l.) in \nthe DRP. As of the hearing, payment agreements had been negotiated on two accounts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.l.). Between May 2023 and September 2023, Applicant made monthly \npayments of approximately $708 to the DRP. These funds pay for a program fee ($10 a \nmonth) and are accumulated in an account to be paid towards settlements negotiated by \nthe DRP. The DRP negotiates settlements and educates Applicant on contacting \ncreditors; however, the program does not provide credit counseling or advice about \nbudgeting. A few days before the hearing, Applicant learned that two accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d. and 1.k.) could not be included in the DRP, so he paid those debts on his own. (AE \nB; AE C6; AE C7; Tr. 43-48, 77-78, 88) \nAlthough Applicant and his then wife separated in December 2016, they continued \nto reside together until mid-2017. Then she and their child moved out of the marital \nresidence, and she sought spousal and child support. Beginning in mid-2017, Applicant \npaid monthly approximately $1,300 in spousal support and $1,000 in child support. Upon \nthe finalization of the divorce, he was required to pay monthly about $1,000 or $1,100 in \nspousal support and $700 in child support.

(Tr. 33, 40, 70-\n74)  \nApplicant did not address his delinquent accounts prior to May 2023 because he \nwas focused on maintaining his mortgage and other monthly financial obligations. He \nrefinanced his mortgage in about 2019, and he brought and kept current a credit-card \naccount that had been past due during his marital separation. To corroborate his claim \nthat he has responsibly managed his monthly financial obligations since 2019, he provided \nan account history showing him in good standing on his mortgage loan and one credit-\ncard account. Without providing corroborated documents, he claimed that he paid more \nthan the minimum payment on the credit-card account. In about January and February \n2023, he researched debt-resolution programs. During a consultation with his DRP in May \n2023, he learned that his strategy of addressing only one account at a time was not \nadvised. (Tr. 38-39, 79-85) \nApplicant did not provide a monthly budget outlining his income and expenses. \nHowever, as of the hearing, he estimated that he had approximately $22,000 in retirement \nsavings, and about $400 remaining from each paycheck after expenses. It was unclear \nwhether the calculated remainder included his DRP payments. (Tr. 68, 75) \nApplicant presented evidence of several awards he earned during his military \nservice, including an Iraq Campaign medal, five Army Commendation medals, eight Army \nAchievement medals, and a Meritorious Unit medal. As an employee of a DOD contractor, \nhe was recognized as a subject-matter expert and praised for his experience, tenacity, \nand technical knowledge. Applicant's ex-wife submitted a letter of recommendation \nattesting to Applicant's perseverance and integrity. (AE C9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant's eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge's overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\"whole-person concept.\" The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \"[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \"witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\" The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \"in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\" See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds .... \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant's 12 accounts, totaling approximately $46,529, became delinquent \nbetween July 2017 and April 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe per\n \nson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by\n \n predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant's responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant's security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)], supra. \"Any \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" Directive, \nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). (ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, \n2013)) \nCritical in Applicant's case is the timing of his debt-resolution efforts. The DOHA \nAppeal Board, in ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017), addressed the \nimportance of evaluating the timing of such efforts.: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nThe time of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant's case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. \nApplicant's debt-resolution efforts did not begin until May 2023. He paid two debts \nin August 2023, and he had started payments on two more accounts. There is no evidence \nof credit counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. \nApplicant assumed the marital debt upon his divorce, and he was required to pay \nsignificant spousal and child support. From mid-2017 to April 2018, his monthly support \nobligation totaled $2,300. From April 2018 to 2022, his monthly support obligation totaled \n$1,700. Since 2022, his monthly obligation totaled $850 for child support and health \ninsurance. Applicant established the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nTo establish the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant bears the burdens of \nproduction and persuasion in mitigation, and must demonstrate that he acted responsibly \nto address and resolve his delinquent accounts. Applicant did not provide a monthly \nbudget or other evidence sufficient to meet his burden to establish that he was financially \nincapable of addressing his delinquent accounts given his spousal and child support \nobligations. Although his spousal support obligation ended in 2022, he did not begin \nmaking $708 monthly payments with the DRP until May 2023. Although he researched \ndebt-resolution companies in about January and February 2023, he did not contact his \ncreditors, make payments or payment arrangements, or enroll in a DRP until after the \nissuance of the SOR. Notwithstanding the significant financial hardship Applicant faced \nfollowing his divorce, he has not demonstrated that he acted responsibly to address his \ndelinquent accounts, particularly after his spousal support obligation ended in 2022. AG \n\u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nIn August 2023, Applicant paid two accounts totaling approximately $5,600. While \nthese debt-resolution efforts reflect favorably on Applicant, such efforts are undermined \nby their timing and fall short of the good faith required under AG \u00b6 20(d). It is premature \nto conclude that Applicant has established a track record of financial responsibility. He did \nnot mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant's eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant's \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n____________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army and Army Reserve, including two \ncombat deployments. He has earned awards and praise for his performance and \ncharacter in his military and civilian careers. Applicant's financial problems were triggered \nby his marital separation. His ability to address his delinquent debts was reasonably \nimpacted by his $1,700 monthly support obligation. However, when that support obligation \nreduced to $850 in 2022, he did not initiate any debt-resolution efforts until after the \nissuance of the SOR. Applicant has not demonstrated that he has acted financially \nresponsibly to address his delinquent debts. He did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.l.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric H. Borgstrom \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He received a volunteer service medal for his efforts. (Tr. 20; \nResponse to SOR at 8) The medal apparently was a civilian award, because it is not \nreflected on his DD 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty). \nIn June 2015, while Applicant was serving as a chief petty officer (pay grade E-7) \non a ship, he was sexually involved with a female sailor (pay grade E-3) who was his \nsubordinate. He testified that his sexual relationship with the female sailor continued for \nabout two years, and that it involved frequent sexual activity in numerous places aboard \nthe ship. (Tr. 32; GX 2 at 2) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in \nNovember 2022, he told the investigator that he became sexually involved with his \nsubordinate because he was lonely and did not exercise the strength to resist his sexual \nurges. (GX 2, personal subject interview at 15) \nIn July 2016, Applicant was charged with rape and sexual assault, in violation of \nArticle 120, (UCMJ), making a false official statement in violation of Article 107, UCMJ, \nand obstructing justice in violation of Article 134, UCMJ. (GX 4) He testified that the sexual \nconduct for which he was charged with rape occurred in an office aboard the ship and \nwhile he and the female sailor were both on duty. He maintained that it was consensual. \nHe testified that when the female sailor told him she was pregnant by another sailor, he \ntold her that he did not want to be involved in a \u201clove triangle.\u201d (Tr. 15-16, 34.) \nThe charge of making a false official statement arose when Applicant was five \nminutes late for duty as officer of the deck, and he told the chief petty officer whom he \nwas relieving that he was late because he was performing duties on the flight deck. The \ncharge of obstructing justice alleged that Applicant asked the sailor by whom the female \nseaman was pregnant not to report his actions, and that Applicant attempted to physically \nrestrain the female sailor\u2019s other sexual partner from reporting them. In March 2017, he \nwas charged with an additional offense of violating a lawful general order, i.e., a Navy \nregulation prohibiting fraternization with a subordinate, in violation of Article 92, UCMJ. \n(GX 5). \nAfter a pretrial hearing, Applicant admitted his guilt of the violations of Articles 107 \nand 92, and he requested separation in lieu of trial by court-martial.2 (GX 5 at 3) His \nrequest was granted, and all charges were withdrawn and dismissed. He received an \nother than honorable discharge in June 2017. \nIn November 2020, Applicant, then employed by another defense contractor, was \nterminated for timecard fraud, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The alleged fraud consisted of taking \npaid time off without recording it on his timecard. This job was his first civilian job after \nleaving the Navy, and he was unfamiliar with the timecard process. He explained that he \nwas a salaried employee rather than an hourly employee, and he was not required to log \n2 The SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant was accused of rape and sexual assault and was indicted by a grand \njury for those charges. There is no grand jury in cases processed under the UCMJ. Instead, there is a \npretrial hearing under Rule for Court-Martial 309(a) or an investigation under Article 32, UCMJ, or both. \nUnlike a grand jury, in which a defendant is not present, an accused military member is entitled to be present \nduring a pretrial hearing, be represented by counsel, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin and log out daily.

(Tr. 50) There is no evidence that he was overpaid \nbecause of the inaccurate timecards. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was terminated from a previous employment due \nto timecard fraud. The evidence shows that Applicant requested approval of paid time off \nand his supervisor approved it, but that he did not properly record his paid time off on his \ntimecards. It also shows that he was unfamiliar with the process, since this was his first \ncivilian job after leaving the Navy. While the evidence shows negligence on Applicant\u2019s \npart, it falls short of establishing fraud. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant, while serving as a non-commissioned officer, \nwas accused of rape and sexually assault by an enlisted shipmate and that he was \nindicted by a grand jury for his conduct. It apparently was intended to allege rape of and \nsexual assault on an enlisted shipmate. Furthermore, the allegation that he was indicted \nby a grant jury is not established, because there is no grand jury in military prosecutions. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant \u201cresigned\u201d from the Navy in lieu of trial by courts-\nmartial after admitting that he made a false official statement in violation of Article 92, \nUCMJ and violated a general order in violation of Article 107, UCMJ, and that he received \nan other than honorable discharge. The SOR incorrectly transposed Article 92 and Article \n107. Violation of an order is proscribed by Article 92, not Article 107. A false official \nstatement is proscribed by Article 107, not Article 92. \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied making a false official statement, but his denial is \ncontradicted by his admission of guilt in his request for discharge in lieu of court-martial. \nI conclude that this allegation is established, except for the allegation that Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nresigned. Enlisted members of the military cannot resign, but they may request \nseparation, as Applicant did in this case. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nNotwithstanding the defects in the pleadings in this case, the evidence is sufficient \nto establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct . . . that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or \ngroup. Such conduct includes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, \ncould affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing; \nand \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual misconduct with a subordinate aboard a Navy ship was not \nminor. It was not infrequent and did not happen under unique circumstances. However, it \nhappened more than eight years ago, and there is no evidence of similar misconduct \nsince June 2015. His chain of command did not believe that his misconduct warranted a \ncourt-martial and allowed him to leave the Navy without a criminal conviction, albeit with \nan other than honorable discharge. He appears to have gained control of his promiscuous \nsexual tendencies. I conclude that AG \u00b6 17(c) is established for this incident. \nThe record contains no evidence regarding the false official statement, other than \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his request for separation in lieu of court-martial.

AG \u00b6 17(c) is established for this incident. \nApplicant denied the allegation of obstructing justice, and there is no evidence in \nthe record supporting the allegation. AG \u00b6 17(f) is established for this incident. \nApplicant\u2019s inattention to the rules for documenting paid time off was minor. His \nemail exchanges with his supervisor, who approved the time paid off, refutes the \nallegation of fraud. AG \u00b6 17(f) is established for this incident. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c under this \nguideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(e): discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons other \nthan \u201cHonorable.\u201d \nTwo mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is established for the reasons set out in the above discussion of \nGuideline E. AG \u00b6 32(d) is partially established. There has been a considerable \npassage of time without recurrence of criminal activity. Since Applicant\u2019s discharge \nfrom the Navy, he has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. He is \nactive in his church and his community. However, he offered no evidence of the \nquality of his performance as an employee of a defense contractor before was \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nterminated for timecard fraud, and no evidence of the quality of his performance in \nhis current non-federal job. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nSOR \u00b6 3.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c under this \nguideline. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13(b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual conduct violated military criminal law. When interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator, he attributed his conduct to his loneliness and failure to exercise the \nstrength to resist his sexual urges. His conduct was compulsive, self-destructive, and \nhigh-risk. It made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, and it reflected lack \nof discretion or judgment. Accordingly, I conclude that all the above disqualifying \nconditions are established: \nThe relevant mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 14(b): \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so \nlong ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment.\u201d I conclude that this mitigating condition is established by the passage of time \nand the reasons set out in the above discussion of Guideline E. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, J, and D in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. Applicant was candid, remorseful, and credible at \nthe hearing. His behavioral history is mixed. He demonstrated bad judgment when he had \nan extramarital relationship that resulted in the birth of a son in 2008, but then he exhibited \ncompassion by adopting the older son of the same woman with whom he had an affair. \nHe demonstrated bad judgment by his sexual conduct with a subordinate while on active \nduty, but demonstrated compassion by his work with orphans while his ship was in port. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, D, \nand J, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his personal conduct, sexual \nbehavior, and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On March 13, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency Consolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline H, Drug \nInvolvement and Substance Misuse; and Guideline J, Criminal Conduct. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the Department of Defense \nafter June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 7, 2023, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge.

He has a high school \ndiploma and two semesters of college. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as \nan Aircraft Structures Mechanic. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nAmendment to the Statement of Reasons \nDepartment Counsel, pursuant to \u00b6 E.3.1.13. of the D\n \nirective 5220.6, dated \nJanuary 2, 1992, (as amended) moved to amend the March 13, 2023, Statement of \nReasons (SOR) in this case by adding allegations 2.c., 2.d., 2.e. and 2.f under Guideline \nJ on July 28, 2023. Applicant had no objection, and four additional allegations were \nincluded under Guideline J.  \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, which can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness. \n1.a. \nApplicant started using marijuana in 1992, at the early age of 13 while in middle \nschool, mainly on the weekends. By high school he was using marijuana a few times \nduring the week and during the weekends. After high school, Applicant was using \nmarijuana on a regular basis, several times during the week and on the weekends. \nApplicant stated that his friends would sell it to him, until he got his medical marijuana \ncard, and then he purchased it at a dispensary. He continued to use marijuana at this \nfrequency until about April 2022, when he was hired by his current employer. He explained \nthat it took him about eight months from the date he applied to the date he was hired. He \nstated that he started tapering off his use of marijuana in December 2021, and he last \nused it in April 2022. Applicant stated that his employment with a defense c ontractor has \ninspired him to stop using marijuana or any other illegal drug in the future. \nApplicant stated that his wife still smokes marijuana a few times a week. She goes \noutside to smoke it and does not smoke it in Applicant's presence. (Tr. p. 27.) She has a \nmedical marijuana card and purchases it from a dispensary. \n1.b. \nApplicant also used methamphetamines from about October 2017 to May 2018. \nHe explained that when he learned that he was going to be the father of twin daughters \nwith lots of responsibility going forward, he thought that using methamphetamines could \nhelp him accomplish his many tasks. He knew that one of his friends used it and so he \npurchased it from his friend, first on a monthly basis, and then weekly. He normally used \nmethamphetamines by himself, but he has used it with his family members including his \ncousin, who has now stopped using it, and his brother-in- law, who died of a heroin \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \noverdose. After his twins were born, Applicant realized that he should stop using it before \nhe is unable to stop. Applicant's wife does not use methamphetamines. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct  \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal activity that \ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The \nallegations are discussed in chronological order. \n2.f. \nIn November 1999, Applicant was convicted of Larceny. Applicant explained that \nhe had been out of high school for about two years or so when he was caught stealing \nsome cassette tapes from a record store. (Tr. p. 34.) He was required to perform eight \ndays of community service and pay a fine. (Government Exhibit 4.) \n2.e. \nIn March 2004, Applicant was arrested for having a receptacle containing cannabis \nor having cannabis products in his possession while driving, failure to provide proof of \nfinancial responsibility, failure to properly restrain passengers, and driving while his \nlicense was suspended or revoked. The day of his arrest, Applicant was stopped and had \nmarijuana in his car. Applicant stated that he was a horrible driver. He had received a \nnumber of tickets and did not respect the fact that a driver's license is a privilege. He was \nyoung and immature. He stated that he has learned a tough lesson from his past \nexperiences. On this occasion, Applicant was convicted of driving while his license was \nsuspended or revoked. He was sentenced to 36 months of probation and required to \nperform 145 hours of community service. (Government Exhibit 5.)  \n2.d. \nIn September 2007, Applicant was convicted of driving under the influence of \nalcohol. He was sentenced to 36 months of probation, required to attend a three-month \nalcohol and drug education and counseling program, and required to pay a fine. He was \nalternatively permitted to serve 13 days in jail in lieu of the fine. Applicant explained that \nhe had gone out to several bars drinking with his cousin and friends. After drinks they \nwent to his cousin's apartment to spend the night. A friend with them wanted to go home, \nand so Applicant was taking him when he swerved out of the lane, and the police officer \npulled him over. Applicant underwent the field sobriety test and was arrested. \n(Government Exhibit 6.) \n2.b. \nIn August 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence of marijuana. He pled guilty, and was sentenced to probation and required to \ncomplete a rehabilitation program. This was Applicant's second offense for driving under \nthe influence. Applicant's license was suspended for about one year as a result of this \narrest. (Government Exhibit 7.) \n2.c. \nIn February 2015, Applicant was arrested for driving on a revoked or suspended \nlicense due to driving under the influence, which violated the terms of probation imposed \nas a result of the October 2014 conviction for driving under the influence of drugs. He was \nsentenced to 36 months of probation and 10 days in jail that he served in June 2015. \n \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant violated t he terms of this probation. He explained t hat many times he go\n \nt rides \nfrom his friends and family members, but other times he still drove without a license. (Tr. \np. 40, and Government Exhibit 8.) \n2.a. \nIn March 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of illegal \ndrugs. Applicant explained that he was on his way home from work and went to get gas. \nHe was driving away from the gas station when the police pulled him over. Applicant had \nbeen smoking methamphetamine and had a pipe in his cup holder. The officer searched \nthe vehicle, found the pipe, and arrested the Applicant. Applicant was required to attend \na rehabilitation program and during the program he stopped using methamphetamines. \n(Tr. p. 42.) Applicant stated that he attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for \nabout a year and a half. After completing the meetings that were court ordered, he \ncontinued going. He felt good about discussing with others the struggles they had in \ncommon. He last attended AA meetings sometime in late 2018. Applicant has never been \noffered or received an alcohol or drug rehabilitation program, whether inpatient or out-\npatient. He quit using marijuana and methamphetamine on his own. (Government Exhibit \n2.) \nApplicant stated that he now has a family and children to provide for and show that \nhe is responsible. He stated that he is a role model for his children. He does not hang \naround drug users or old friends. His life now it to make sure his children are prepared for \ntheir soccer games and their gymnastic events. His current employment and his desire to \npossess a security clearance is also his motivation to have a better life. He now realizes \nthat he no longer needs to use illegal drugs. They do not help him to be productive, it is \njust a waste of time and money. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant's suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant's eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge's overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \"[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\" In reaching this decision, I have \n \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that establishes \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \"applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\" \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \"in terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\" See also EO 12968, Section 3.1 (b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H; Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security concerns. \nNone of the conditions are applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors demonstrate full mitigation. For 28 years, Applicant \nabused marijuana and/or methamphetamines. Marijuana was clearly his drug of choice. \nHe stated that he stopped using marijuana in April 2022. He now has only about a little \nmore than a year of sobriety. Time will only tell if he remains drug free. With hard work \nand discipline, Applicant may eventually get to where he wants to go, as the rewards for \ngood conduct are priceless, but at this time, with his long history of drug use, he has not \nyet shown sufficient time in a drug free lifestyle to convince the Government that he will \nnot return to his old ways. At this time, he has not shown the pattern and practice of \nsufficient good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access \nto classified information. \nGuideline J; Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which is \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant committed numerous violations of the law, including driving under the \ninfluence of alcohol, driving under the influence of drugs, possession of illegal drugs, \ndriving while license suspended or revoked, and violation of probation, among others. The \naforementioned disqualifying conditions have been established. \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance, with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good \nemployment \nrecord, or \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is no question that Applicant is working hard to improve his life and is focused \nin the right direction. He has not violated the law for several years. Hopefully, he will \ncontinue to improve his life and stay crime free. However, at this time, his long history of \ncriminal conduct creates doubt concerning his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability or willingness to abide by law, rules, and regulations. None of the mitigating \nconditions establish full mitigation. \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, and Guideline J, in my whole-person analysis. To hold a security clearance \nis a privilege and not a right. While holding a security clearance one is expected to show \nhonesty, responsibility and good judgment at all times. Applicant has only recently started \nto demonstrate a positive pattern of conduct and the level of maturity needed for access \nto classified information. However, at this time, he is not an individual with whom the \nGovernment can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations and \ndo the right thing, even when no one is looking. Right now, he is not qualified for access \nto classified information, nor is it certain that sensitive information will be properly \nprotected. More time is needed to determine that his past pattern of poor judgment is \nfinally over for good. Applicant's decision to be responsible must establish a sustained \npattern of good conduct. He may in the future be found to be eligible for access to \nclassified information, but it will take work on his part to show that he can be drug free and \nwithout criminal conduct for a significant period of time to establish security clearance \neligibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nCriminal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a, and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, through 2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

The documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take \nadministrative notice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are \nlimited to matters of general knowledge, and not subject to reasonable dispute. They \nare set out in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b. and 2.c. She denied \nSOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old employee of the United Nations (UN). She has been \nemployed with the UN since March of 2020. Applicant is not married, and has no \nchildren. (TR at page 23 line 22 to page 25 line 17, and GX 1 at pages 13 and 21.) \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n1.a. Applicant admits that, in the past, she had close and continuing contact with \nrelatives who are citizens and residents of Iraq.  She has ceased her contact with these \nIraqi relatives since receipt of the SOR in June 2023. These relatives are: her 70-year-\nold grandmother, who never worked outside of her home; her 85-year-old grandfather \nwho is long retired but never worked for the Iraqi government; her 45-year-old uncle \nwho is a pharmacist; her 56-year-old uncle who is a security guard; her 40-year-old aunt \nwho is a homemaker; her 28-year-old cousin who works for the UN in Switzerland; her \n55-year-old uncle who is a driver for the UN in Iraq; and finally, her 47-year-old aunt \nwho works for the Red Cross. (TR at page 40 line 7 to page 52 line 23.) All of her \nimmediate family, comprising her parents and siblings, are citizens and residents of the \nUnited States. (TR at page 31 lines 7~10, and GX 1 at pages 22~28.) \n1.b. Applicant maintains a bank account in Iraq, with an approximate value of \n$2,000. This bank account is a matter of necessity, as there is a 10% surcharge to \nwithdraw funds from a U.S. bank account in Iraq. (TR at page 25 line 18 to page 28 line \n2, at page 34 lines 21~25, at page 53 line 4 to page 54 line 3.) The Applicant\u2019s witness, \na former FBI Agent and her UN supervisor, further explained the necessity to maintain \nan Iraqi bank account for those unable to leave Iraq on occasion and bank outside the \ncountry. (TR at page 20 line 13 to page 22 line 18.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n2.a. Applicant denies that she is indebted to Creditor A in the amount of about \n$1,344. This debt has been settled and paid as evidenced by Applicant\u2019s \ndocumentation. (TR at page 32 lines 11~17, at page 32 line 25 to page 33 line 11, and \nAppX E.) \n2.b. Applicant denies that she is indebted to Creditor B in the amount of about \n$56. This debt has been paid in full as evidenced by Applicant\u2019s documentation. (TR at \npage 32 lines 18~24, at page 33 lines 12~18, and AppX F.) \n2.c. Applicant is making the monthly payments of $150 towards her charged-off \ncar loan, which were agreed to by the creditor, as evidenced by documentation. (TR at \npage 33 line 19 to page 34 line 5, and AppXs G and U.) \nNotice \nI take administrative notice of the following facts regarding the Republic of Iraq: \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The U.S. Department of Sate travel \nadvisory for Iraq is Level 4: Do not trave! During 2021, the primary terrorist threats \nwithin Iraq included ISIS remnants and various Iran-aligned militia groups. Significant \nhuman rights issues remain present in Iraq. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest; and  \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nApplicant works for the UN in Iraq, has a bank account in Iraq, and has many \nIraqi relatives The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant works for the UN and has no connection with the Iraqi government. \nShe has ceased contact with her Iraqi relatives, none of whom have any connection \nwith the Iraqi government. Applicant\u2019s $2,000 Iraqi bank account is used only as a \nmatter of convenience to cover her monthly expenses. Foreign Influence is found for \nApplicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had about $9,000 of past-due indebtedness The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems have been addressed. The only debt she has \nremaining is a car loan, towards which she is making monthly payments as agreed to by \nthe creditor. Applicant has demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. She \nlives within her monthly budget. (AppX H.) Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been \nestablished. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a distinguished history of working in the UN and is respected by \nher supervisor who testified in her behalf. She performs well at her job. (AppXs I~L, R \nand T.) Her closest familial ties are with her parents and siblings, all of whom are \nresident American citizens. She has ceased contacts with her relatives in Iraq in order \nto further minimize any potential coercion or duress. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence and Financial Considerations \nsecurity concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s April 2023 SOR response, he admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. The SOR alleges eight delinquent accounts totaling approximately $17,116. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He served in the Air National Guard from 1995 through 2000. He took some online college courses in 2019 and 2020, but he has not yet earned a degree. He married in 1999 and divorced in 2000. He married a second time in 2003 and divorced in 2011. He married a third time in 2013, and as of the date of the hearing, Applicant and his wife were involved in a pending divorce. He has two biological sons, ages 9 and 16, and he has three stepchildren, a set of twins who are 19 years old and a 21-year-old.

Specifically, the SOR set forth security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F (financial considerations). \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn April 2023, Applicant provided a response to the SOR with attached \ndocumentation and requested a hearing.

His hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six Government exhibits (GE) 1-\n5, and a hearing exhibit (HE) 1; I labeled the documentation Applicant provided with his \nSOR Answer as Applicant exhibits (AE) A, B, and C; and all proffered exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection.

On \nSeptember 21, 2023, the record closed. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2023 SOR response, he admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f. The SOR alleges eight \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $17,116. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He served in the Air National Guard from 1995 through \n2000. He took some online college courses in 2019 and 2020, but he has not yet earned \na degree. He married in 1999 and divorced in 2000. He married a second time in 2003 \nand divorced in 2011. He married a third time in 2013, and as of the date of the hearing, \nApplicant and his wife were involved in a pending divorce. He has two biological sons, \nages 9 and 16, and he has three stepchildren, a set of twins who are 19 years old and a \n21-year-old. Since April 2022, he has been employed by a federal contractor as a \nmanager of physical security and security control. His annual salary is $106,000. He does \nnot currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 22-24, 48; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant testified there were several factors that contributed to his financial \nproblems. Beginning in 2014, he and his spouse were the victims of identity theft. They \nwere informed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that they owed taxes of \napproximately $43,000, and a tax lien was filed against them. Applicant was the sole \nwage earner for the family, and he began to experience financial problems as a result of \nrepaying the tax lien and attempting to continue to pay his monthly expenses. He also \nwas found to be at fault in a car accident in 2014 and did not have car insurance. He had \nto repay the other driver for the damages out-of-pocket, and he was eventually able to \nsatisfy a civil judgment that was filed against him for the remaining amount of \napproximately $8,000. In about early 2020, the IRS was able to determine that identity \ntheft and fraud had taken place and returned approximately $18,000 that Applicant had \npreviously paid. He was unemployed from April 2020 to June 2020, and he used some of \nthe returned tax money to pay for his family\u2019s cost of living and to pay other debts.

He was either unable or unwilling \nto take control of the family finances to prevent her reckless spending. He admitted he \nprovided a specific timeline in his SOR response of when he planned to pay off several \ndelinquent debts, but due to the expense of hiring an attorney and filing for divorce, he \nwas unable to keep his financial commitments.

He contacted the \ncreditor in April 2023, and he was able to get a settlement offer of $226. He intended to \nsettle the account by June 2023. As of the date of the hearing, he had not made any \npayments. This debt is unresolved.

His \nmonthly net income is approximately $3,500, and after paying his monthly expenses, he \nhas a net monthly remainder of $74.

(AE D; Tr. 45-46) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, as shown by his admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of incurring delinquent debts since 2014. He receives some \nmitigating credit for experiencing circumstances that were beyond his control, such as his \ndivorce, identity theft, and periods of unemployment that resulted in his financial \nproblems. The mitigating credit is lessened, due to his failure to call his creditors to settle \ndelinquent accounts, or set-up payment plans, before he received the SOR. Additionally, \ndue to his unexpected divorce in process, he has been unable to make payments toward \nhis debts as he indicated he would in his SOR. To receive full credit for mitigation, he \nmust also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances in addressing his \ndelinquent debts, and in this case, he failed to do so. \nIn the context of Applicant\u2019s security eligibility, I find that he did not act responsibly \nby failing to address his delinquent debts well before the issuance of the SOR. There is \nno evidence that he participated in financial counseling, and there are no clear indications \nthat his financial problems are being resolved or under control. Based on documentation, \nthe bulk of Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved. Under these circumstances, Applicant \nfailed to establish that financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s PFS, he does not currently earn enough income to repay his \ndelinquent debts due to expenses associated with a pending divorce. He failed to meet \nhis burden to mitigate the financial security concerns due to a lack of an established track \nrecord of responsible financial management. This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. With more effort toward documented \nresolution of his delinquent debts, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

He holds the position of Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance \nin connection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant obtained a Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013, and a Master\u2019s degree in 2016. \nIn April 2017, he was hired to work for defense contractor (A) as a Mechanical \nEngineer. During the interview process, Applicant was told that the position would \nrequire a security clearance. He was also told that the company had a zero-tolerance \nsubstance abuse policy, and that any use of an illegal substance could result in strict \ndisciplinary action. Applicant was also given written notification reiterating the company \npolicy prohibiting illegal drug use. On June 8, 2017, Applicant applied for a security \nclearance. Applicant was granted a security clearance. \nWhile working for defense contractor (A), and after completing his security \nclearance application on June 2017, Applicant used THC with varying frequency from \nabout January 2018 to about September 2020.  Applicant stated that he used marijuana \nabout three to four times in 2018.  (Tr. p. 32.)  He does not recall if he ingested \nmarijuana in 2019.  (Tr. p. 32.)  In 2020, he believes he used it two to three times.  (Tr. \np. 32.)  He stated that he has never purchased THC, as it has always been provided to \nhim by friends.  He stated that he used marijuana in the form of gummies.  He would \nuse it at friend\u2019s homes, or at social events, such as game nights or movie nights.  (Tr. \np. 34.)  At this time, Applicant held a security clearance, and was employed in a \nsensitive position.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  \nApplicant testified that his use of THC has usually coincided with his high levels \nof anxiety and stress. He has also used it socially, recreationally, and to help him relax. \nHe stated that when he moved from New York to Arizona he had a particularly difficult \ntime. During the pandemic he lost a family member, and was isolated from family and \nfriends. The extended period of isolation affected him. (Tr. p. 36.)

He has found that that the use of \nTHC/marijuana has been helpful to sleep and relax. \nIn the summer of 2020, and while still working for defense contractor (A), \nApplicant started looking for other employment opportunities. He was hired by defense \ncontractor (B) in October 2020. He was again reminded by this defense contractor of \ntheir zero-tolerance substance abuse policy, which is DoD wide, and that his job \nrequired a security clearance. \nApplicant started as a Packaging Engineer. \nOn \nNovember 5, 2021, Applicant completed another security clearance application. \n(Government Exhibit 2.) \nWhile working for defense contractor (B), and after completing his security \nclearance application in November 2021, Applicant used THC with varying frequency \nfrom about September 2020 to about May 2022. \nApplicant stated that he used \nmarijuana on two occasions in 2021, and on two occasions in 2022. (Tr. pp. 35 and \n38.) On each occasion of use, he ingested one marijuana gummie. (Tr. p. 39.) At this \ntime, Applicant was employed in a sensitive position. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nApplicant testified that in June 2022, after his interview with the DoD investigator, \nhe reported his use of THC for that year. (Tr. p. 51.) He told the investigator that he \nused THC only two times between November 2021 to May 2022. In a Statement of \nMitigating Conditions he provided dated June 4, 2023, he stated that he used THC a \ntotal of three times between January 2018 and November 2021; and from November \n2021 to May 2022, he used THC two times. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \nSince May 2022, Applicant has taken steps to alleviate the factors that \ncontributed to his use of THC. \nHe has received eight sessions of psychological \ncounseling and therapy to improve his mental health through his Employee Assistance \nProgram. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) He has also obtained a membership in a martial arts \nacademy for physical exercise and self-development. \nA fraternity brother from college, who is an attorney, testified on Applicant\u2019s \nbehalf. \nHe stated that he has never seen Applicant use any illegal drug or any \nprescription medication that was not prescribed to him. He has never seen him act in a \nway that would display moral turpitude or a defect in character. He stated that Applicant \nwas always the mentor and role model for others.  (Tr. pp. 14 - 23.) \nApplicant underwent a THC drug screening with negative results dated June 3, \n2023.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nA letter of recommendation from a college roommate and friend of the Applicant \nattests to his integrity and selflessness. Applicant is further described as intelligent, \nhardworking, responsible, and a leader and model citizen.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. Applicant deliberately used THC, \n(marijuana), while possessing a security clearance, and while employed in a sensitive \nposition. Applicant states that he has sought out psychological counseling to avoid \nfuture THC use, and is no longer using THC, and has no intentions to use it again. \nHowever, his actions are not mitigated. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a while-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation.  This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of; \n(2) any disruptive, violent or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 17 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two of the conditions are potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nWhether Applicant used THC five times, or ten times, the number of times he \nused it is irrelevant here. What is relevant is the fact that he used it during employment \nwith two defense contractors, while either possessing a security clearance, and/or while \nemployed in a sensitive position. Applicant knew that the use of THC is against Federal \nlaw, and clearly prohibited by the Department of Defense. Applicant also knew that the \nuse of marijuana is illegal while possessing a security clearance. His conduct shows \nimmaturity, poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Applicant did not follow the rules. Instead, \nhe chose to live his life to his convenience, and disregarded the law. Applicant\u2019s \ndeliberate use of THC while employed in a sensitive position and/or while holding a \nsecurity clearance is immature, irresponsible, inappropriate behavior, that shows \nquestionable judgment. Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant does not show \nthe maturity level, integrity, and reliability necessary to access classified information. At \nthis time, Applicant does not meet the eligibility qualifications for a security clearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity needed for access to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant understands the requirements associated with holding a security clearance \nand knows that marijuana use is not tolerated. Applicant is not an individual in whom \nthe Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant does not \nmeet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nPersonal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

On April 10, 2023, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services \n(CAS) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her under Executive Order (Exec.

She claimed that \u201cthings have been a struggle over \nthe last two years trying to keep up, but [her] intention is to get anything [she owes] \ncleared up. [She works] fulltime and even [does] part time work (door dash) when [she is] \nable to in order to get extra money.\u201d (Item 3 at 42) During her September 2022 interview \nwith an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant \ndiscussed various delinquent accounts and claimed to be unaware of others. She \nindicated that she was participating in repayment plans and intended to set up other \nrepayment plans. She disputed several of the accounts discussed. She provided \ndocumentation to corroborate her claimed actions pertaining to some of her financial \naccounts. (Item 6 at 4-9) \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that she had set up an overall \nrepayment plan prioritizing accounts and was making monthly payments on several \naccounts, would start making payments on other accounts as soon as the prioritized \naccounts were resolved, and that her largest account would be addressed when she \ncompleted the other smaller accounts. She added: \nI can admit to making several mistakes in regard to not paying bills on time \nor settling some financial debts in my past. This is true, but it is not at all a \nsign of other underlying issues. There were times when I was out of work \nbut the bills kept coming, so I would have to choose one bill over another to \npay and things continued to fall behind. In those situations, it does take time \nto make things right and that is what I have been trying to do along with \nmaking sure my current household bills are on track. As you will see in my \nresponse to each item below most of these items have either been \naddressed already or are being addressed because it is something I have \nbeen trying to clean up. \n(Item 2 at 1) \nThe SOR alleged 17 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,614, as \nset forth below: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. refers to a credit union automobile loan with an unpaid balance of \n$13,161 that was placed for collection and charged off.

Her work ethic was second to none in accounts receivables and, since her \nsuspension, it is taking two personnel to cover her duties in her absence. He looks forward \nto having her return to work as soon as possible. (Character reference, dated June 21, \n2023, attached to Response to FORM) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor characterized her as always reliable, resourceful, integrity-\ndriven and dedicated. She is a team player with a positive, can-do attitude, and does the \nwork of two people. She would not hesitate to have her back again and is currently \nkeeping her position open in the hopes of having her return.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.

Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged 17 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $24,614. On \nits face, without any background information, Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debts \nappears to present either an inability to satisfy debts or a history of not meeting financial \nobligations. Despite her initial disputes regarding several of her debts, her eventual \ndeclared willingness to satisfy those debts is unambiguous. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have \nbeen established, but AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply. As noted above, Applicant claimed that things \nhave been a struggle over the last two years trying to keep up, but her intention was to \nget anything she owes cleared up. She worked fulltime and even did part-time work when \nshe was able to in order to get extra money. During her September 2022 OPM interview \n\u2013 seven months before the SOR was issued \u2013 she indicated that she was participating in \nrepayment plans and intended to set up other repayment plans and provided \ndocumentation to corroborate her claimed actions pertaining to some of her financial \naccounts. She had set up an overall repayment plan prioritizing accounts and was making \nmonthly payments on several accounts, would start making payments on other accounts \nas soon as the prioritized accounts were resolved, and that her largest account would be \naddressed when she completed the other smaller accounts.  \nApplicant noted that she made several mistakes regarding not paying bills on time \nor settling some financial debts in her past. There were times when she was out of work, \nbut the bills kept coming, so she would have to choose one bill over another to pay and \nthings continued to fall behind. In those situations, it does take time to make things right \nand that is what she has been trying to do along with making sure her current household \nbills are on track. It is obvious that Applicant experienced a paradigm shift to more positive \nfinancial responsibilities. Unfortunately, suspending her while she was in the process of \nresolving her financial situation, merely interrupted her efforts to do so. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Before she was interviewed by the OPM investigator, \nApplicant made substantial claims, and in several cases, verifiable efforts, to address \nseveral of the delinquent debts as well as other debts. \nBased on the evidence, it is apparent that Applicant did not intentionally ignore her \ndelinquent accounts for a substantial multi-year period, but that various issues may have \ndelayed her responses. She has made substantial efforts in eventually working with her \ncreditors. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant has offered verified evidence that she had begun making such \nefforts well before the SOR was issued. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant clearly stated that she \nintended to pay off her delinquent debts by certain guideposts (paying off other specified \ndebts). She did eventually move forward and established verifiable repayment plans with \ncertain creditors, as well as verifiable evidence of payments to certain creditors. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling, a budget other than a \nprioritized repayment plan, or anything to describe with any specificity Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial situation. Applicant did not report her current net monthly income or her monthly \nhousehold expenses. She merely referred to receiving unemployment compensation \nsince her suspension. In the absence of such information, I am unable to determine if she \nhas any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. There is a paucity of \nevidence to indicate that her financial problems are now fully under control, and now that \nshe has been at least temporarily suspended from her job it is difficult to determine if \nApplicant is currently in a better position financially than she had been. Nevertheless, \nwhile Applicant\u2019s good-faith efforts were interrupted by her financially relevant \nsuspension, I conclude that if given the opportuning to resume those efforts once she is \nreinstated, she will do so. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances no longer cast \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. \n09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Her history of financial difficulties and \ndelinquent debt is documented in the casefile. The SOR alleged 17 still-delinquent \naccounts totaling approximately $24,614. While the issues first arose several years \nearlier, Applicant apparently did not start to address any of them until mid-2022 \u2013 well \nbefore the SOR was issued. She acknowledged that she made several mistakes about \nnot paying bills on time or settling some financial debts in her past. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant is a 45-year-old former employee of a defense \ncontractor. Until she was laid off upon receiving an SOR in April 2023, she had been \nserving as a senior analyst since September 2022. She previously served as a payroll \nsolutions specialist; a university office manager/financial services; part-time tax preparer; \ncredit union assistant branch manager; certified nursing assistant; and credit union \nsupport team leader and support representative. She was laid off in October 2016 and \nremained briefly unemployed until December 2016. A 1995 high school graduate, she \nattended several different universities between November 2011 and May 2015, but did \nnot receive a degree. She enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in November 1995 and \nserved on active duty until November 1999 when she was honorably discharged as a \ncorporal. During her period of military service Applicant was awarded the Navy and \nMarine Corps Achievement Medal (three awards), and a Good Conduct Medal. She was \ngranted a secret clearance while on active duty and it was renewed while she served as \na CNA. \nDuring her September 2022 OPM interview \u2013 seven months before the SOR was \nissued \u2013 Applicant indicated that she was participating in repayment plans and intended \nto set up other repayment plans and provided documentation to corroborate her claimed \nactions pertaining to some of her financial accounts. She had set up an overall repayment \nplan prioritizing accounts and was making monthly payments on several accounts, would \nstart making payments on other accounts as soon as the prioritized accounts were \nresolved, and that her largest account would be addressed when she completed the other \nsmaller accounts. Unfortunately, Applicant\u2019s good-faith efforts were interrupted by her \nfinancially relevant suspension. Based on her previous verified resolution efforts and her \nparadigm shift, she was on her way to resolving her delinquent debts and would have \nbeen closer to her goal had she not been suspended. Accordingly, there are no continuing \ndoubts about her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008), the Appeal Board \naddressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in financial cases stating: \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of claimed or verifiable efforts to resolve the debts, \nfollowed up by her resolution efforts, is positive and encouraging. Overall, the evidence \nleaves me without substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from her financial difficulties. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) \nthrough AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.q.:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

During the interview he was questioned \nabout his past drug usage. He was asked about his drug usage during the past seven \nyears, and he told the investigator that the only illegal drug he had used in the past was \nmarijuana. He said he only used it by himself. He said he only used marijuana for the \npurpose of reducing joint pain and inflammation. He said because he is a long-distance \nrunner, the running leads to inflammation and joint pain and that he used marijuana to \nalleviate the pain and inflammation. He estimated that he only used marijuana about 10 \nto 20 times. He said he had never used any other drugs. He obtained the marijuana from \na former friend. He last used marijuana in July 2020. He has never been diagnosed for \ndrug abuse or participated in drug counseling or treatment. He said that his use had never \naffected his behavior.

In response to the Section \n23 question which asked if in the last seven years had Applicant illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances, he responded \u201cno.\u201d Section 23 also asked, \u201cHave you EVER \nillegally used or otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance \nwhile possessing a security clearance other than previously listed? Applicant responded \n\u201cno.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant was re-interviewed by a government investigator in January 2023. In his \ninterrogatories, he authenticated his statement to the investigator and did not make any \nchanges. He was asked if he had been involved with using illegal drugs in the past seven \nyears. He responded \u201cno.\u201d He was asked when he last used marijuana and he responded \nit was more than seven years ago, so he was not required to report it on his SF 86. He \ntold the investigator that his last use was in 2014. He was asked if he held a security \nclearance when he used marijuana in 2014 and he responded yes. He said he used \nmarijuana about three times between 2011 and 2014. He smoked dried flowers in a pipe. \nHe would use it for joint pain he experienced from being a long-distance runner. He told \nthe investigator that he did not use marijuana in any other form and had not used any \nother illegal substance or misused prescription medication while holding a security \nclearance. He said he was provided the marijuana but could not recall by whom. (Item 4) \nApplicant further told the investigator that he first used marijuana in 1996 while in \ncollege and shortly after college about five times a year until 2011. He would smoke it \nwith a pipe. He told the investigator that he never used marijuana in any other form such \nas oils or edibles. He is no longer in contact with any of the people he used marijuana \nwith during this period. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the investigator that he had not used marijuana since 2014 and had \nno intention to use it in the future. He reiterated that he used it for joint pain. He said he \nnever used marijuana while working. He explained that he did not disclose his use on his \nmost recent SF 86 because he believed he only had to report his marijuana use for the \npast seven years, not ever. He said his omission was unintentional. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to government interrogatories, he was asked the following \nquestion: \nUnder FEDERAL Law (understanding that marijuana is not legal Federally) \nhave you ever illegally USED any drug or control substance any \nnarcotic, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen (to include LSD or PCP) \nand/or any Cannabis (to include marijuana, CBD and hashish) or misused \nany prescription medication?  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe responded \u201cyes\u201d and listed his marijuana use from August 1996 to April 2014. He \nreported his frequency of use was one to two times a year. He did not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future. He stated,  \nThe frequency of use specified above does not apply to all years between\nthe first and last use dates, and instead represent a loose estimate of an\naverage frequency over the specified time period. There were, in fact, a\nnumber of years that involved zero marijuana use. (Item 4) \n \n \n \nThis question specifically requests disclosure of cannabidiols (CBD). He did not \ndisclose any CBD use.1 \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \n1996 to about July 2020. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleged he used marijuana with varying frequency \n1 The Security Executive Agent for the United States Government provided clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance addressed CBD products: \nWith respect to the use of CBD products, agencies should be aware that using these \ncannabis derivatives may be relevant to adjudications in accordance with SEAD 4. \nAlthough the passage of the Agricultural Improvement Act of 2018 excluded hemp from \nthe definition of marijuana within the Controlled Substances Act, products containing \ngreater than a 0.3 percent concentration of delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a \npsychoactive ingredient in marijuana, do not meet the definition of \u201chemp.\u201d Accordingly, \nproducts labeled as hemp-derived that contain greater than 0.3 percent THC continue to \nmeet the legal definition of marijuana, and therefore remain illegal to use under federal law \nand policy. Additionally, agencies should be aware that the Federal Drug Administration \ndoes not certify levels of THC in CBD products, so the percentage of THC cannot be \nguaranteed, thus posing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal \nlaw. Studies have shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold \nfor hemp, notwithstanding advertising labels (Reference F). Therefore, there is a risk that \nusing these products may nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in a \npositive marijuana test under agency-administered employment or random drug testing \nprograms. Should an individual test positive, they will be subject to an investigation under \nspecific guidelines established by their home agency.  \nThe Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMSHA) provided a warning \nabout CBD products on July 24, 2019: \nStudies have shown that some CBD products\u2019 labeling does not accurately reflect their \ncontent. Cannabis based products containing a THC level greater than 0.3% on a dry \nweight basis do not fall under the Farm Bill\u2019s definition of hemp even if they are labeled as \nsuch. In one study, the amount of CBD in 69% of the 84 tested CBD products was \ninconsistent with that on the label, and some products contained unlabeled cannabinoids, \nincluding THC in amounts up to 6.4 mg/ml. As such, an employee\u2019s drug test may be \npositive for the THC metabolite, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), \ndue to THC in the CBD product.  \nSAMSHA further advised that \u201cfederal agencies should make every effort to inform applicants and \nemployees of the risk that using such products may result in a positive marijuana test.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nfrom about April 2011, to about July 2020, while granted access to classified information. \n(Item 1) \nApplicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a based on the dates. He admitted to using marijuana \ninfrequently between 1996 and 2014. He stated in his SOR answer that he did not report \nhis use on his SF 86 because it was outside the seven-year period. He stated, \nWhen answering the e-QIP questionnaire in 2021, I collectively referred to \nboth marijuana usage in 2014 (which was within the specified 7 year window \nat that time) and CBD marijuana usage for a recurring autoimmune health \nissue that would periodically flare up during periods of intense training for \nmarathon races and cause severe joint pain. This continued until \napproximately July 2020. At that time, I discontinued CBD usage and sought \ntreatment from a rheumatoid specialist and have submitted record of one of \nseveral appointment. (Item 2) \nApplicant further stated in his SOR answer the following: \nFurther, I did not include CBD marijuana usage because the general \nperception of, and stance on, CBD marijuana has been continually evolving \nin recent years. Given the growing popularity of CBD usage for health and \nwellness, the determination of how to distinguish between it and other forms \nof marijuana usage has shifted and has made answering these questions \nchallenging. In retrospect, I sincerely regret omitting CBD usage in my 2022 \ne-QIP questionnaire and 2023 interview. I now recognize that this \ninformation should have been disclosed in the interest of transparency. \n(Item 2) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant provided a timeline of his drug use: \n1996-2002: Occasional marijuana usage while attending college and post-\ngraduation. \n2003-2012: No usage of marijuana. \n2012-2014:\n2014-2020: Periodic usage of CBD during intense training and rheumatic \nflare-ups. \n Infrequent usage of marijuana during periods of rheumatic flare-\nups. \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer to allegation \u00b6 1.b the following: \nAgain, I deny this statement due to the end date. As explained in [\u00b6] 1.a, I \nadmit to using marijuana very infrequently from 2012 to 2014 while granted \naccess to classified information. This usage was tied to periodic rheumatic \nflare-ups that occurred during intense periods of training for long-distance \nrunning races. These flare-ups subsided for a period of time after 2014, \nduring which I ceased usage of marijuana.

(Item \n2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleged Applicant falsified his October 2022 SF 86 when he failed to \ndisclose his marijuana use from 1996 to July 2020 and his use from April 2011 to July \n2020, while granted access to classified information. Although he admitted the allegation, \nhe stated he did not include his CBD usage when responding to his October 2022 SF 86. \nHe said it was not with the intent to falsify but was an honest change in his understanding \nof the classification of CBD. He said it was a judgment call because CDB did not meet \nthe qualification of a drug or controlled substance. He said his omission was not deliberate \nor duplicitous, but instead a result of shifting sentiment towards CBD as a legitimate and \nlegal health and wellness treatment. He was aware that his 2022 SF 86 would be \ncompared to his 2021 SF 86. (Item 1, 2) \nApplicant\u2019s explanation in his SOR answer for why he failed to disclose if he had \never used marijuana while having access to classified information in his October 2022 SF \n86 was because the question was different than the one asked on his 2021 SF 86, which \nhe said only asked about the previous seven years. He said it was an honest oversight \nand not an attempt to provide false information. He said he admitted the information when \nit was brought to his attention in his 2023 interview. (Item 2) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleged Applicant deliberately falsified material facts during a personal \nsubject interview conducted in July 2023, when he stated he had not used illegal drugs \nor controlled substances in the past seven years. Applicant denied the allegation and \nstated it was his understanding that CBD usage did not qualify as an illegal drug or \ncontrolled substance. He said the focus of the interview \u201cwas on pure marijuana usage.\u201d \nIt was only when it was pointed out to him by the investigator that the question asked if \nhe had \u201cEVER\u201d used marijuana while in possession of a security clearance, to which he \nanswered he had done so in 2014. Medicinal marijuana has been legal in the state where \nApplicant lives since 2013. He did not provide evidence that he had a prescription for it. \n(Item 2) \nApplicant provided a response to the FORM. He disputed the arguments in the \nbrief provided by Department Counsel. \nIn his FORM response, Applicant said he \u201cwas confused by a few questions that \nare open to interpretation, legal technicalities concerning CBD and some fuzzy \nrecollections from decades in the past.\u201d He further stated, \u201cAn indisputable fact present \nin both interpretations is that I used marijuana and CBD a small number of times over a \nnumber of years while in possession of a security clearance.\u201d Applicant provided \nadditional explanations and interpretations to his answer and interview statements.

(AE A) \nApplicant unequivocally reported on his 2021 SF 86 and during his 2021 \nbackground interview, which was not corrected when he responded to interrogatories, \nthat he used marijuana up through July 2020. His later self-serving statements that he \nused CBDs, not marijuana, between 2014 and 2021 are not credible. I find that he used \nmarijuana up through July 2020. \nApplicant provided numerous character letters in his SOR answer and response \nto the FORM. He is described as a person of integrity. He is dedicated, professional, \nresponsive, dependable, honest, loyal, creative, productive, and reliable. He is tireless in \nhis work ethic. He is perpetually challenging himself to be a better person. The letters do \nnot mention if they are aware of the specific allegations in the SOR. Those providing \nletters recommended that he retain his security clearance. (Item 2, AE B, C, D, E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nI find by substantial evidence2 that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 1996 to July 2020. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(b) apply. I find, although \n2 Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe evidence supports that Applicant used marijuana while holding a security clearance, \nthere is insufficient evidence to conclude he had access to classified information when \nhe was using marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. I find in his favor on SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant stated in his interviews, answer to the SOR, and response to the FORM \nthat he did not intend to use marijuana in the future. That may be true. However, I have \nconcerns about his past willingness to use it while holding a security clearance. His \nconduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He admitted it \nwas a mistake, but his use was not a one-time out of character event. It was not the result \nof youthful indiscretion or experimentation. Rather, he repeatedly used it, regardless of \nwhy, with little or no regard to the fact that he had a security clearance, and it was illegal. \nHe provided a document to show he was seeing a doctor for his joint pain. He did not \nprovide evidence that the doctor advised him to use marijuana or even CBD, which he \nlater indicated he was using. As noted in the above paragraph as to the security concern, \nit says illegal drug use raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules, and regulations. Those concerns remain. I find the above mitigating \nconditions do not apply. \n04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v.

Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits, or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false, or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination or other official government representative. \nI find by substantial evidence that Applicant deliberately falsified his October 2022 \nSF 86 when he failed to disclose his marijuana use while possessing a security clearance \nand his use within the past seven years. Substantial evidence supports that during \nApplicant\u2019s subject interview with a government investigator in January 2023, he falsified \nmaterial facts when he stated he did not use any illegal drugs or controlled substances \nin the past seven years. \nIn August 2021, Applicant completed an SF 86. In response to Section 23 about \nany illegal drug use in the last seven years, he responded that from March 2014 to July \n2020 he used \u201cTHC.\u201d He stated, \u201cRecreational use. A few times in a year. Maybe 10-20 \ntimes in the last 7 years.\u201d He also admitted that he used marijuana while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. He stated that he no longer used it because he did not enjoy the effect. \nHe also stated that he had purchased the marijuana from a friend. \nIn October 2022, Applicant completed another SF 86. In response to the Section \n23 question which asked if in the last seven years had Applicant illegally used any drugs \nor controlled substances, he responded \u201cno.\u201d Section 23 also asked, \u201cHave you EVER \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nillegally used or otherwise been illegally involved with a drug or controlled substance \nwhile possessing a security clearance other than previously listed? Applicant responded \n\u201cno.\u201d  \nDuring Applicant\u2019s January 2023 interview with a government investigator, he was \nasked when he last used marijuana and he responded it was more than seven years ago, \nso he was not required to report it on his SF 86. He told the investigator that his last use \nwas 2014. He was asked if he held a security clearance when he used marijuana in 2014 \nand he responded \u201cyes.\u201d He said he used marijuana about three times between 2011 and \n2014. He smoked dried flowers in a pipe. He told the investigator that he never used \nmarijuana in any other form such as oils or edibles. \nIt was in Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR in May 2023 that he stated he did not \ninclude his CBD usage when responding to his October 2022 SF 86. He said it was a \njudgment call because CDB did not meet the qualification of a drug or controlled \nsubstance. He said his omission was not deliberate or duplicitous, but instead a result of \nshifting sentiment towards CBD as a legitimate and legal health and wellness treatment. \nI do not find Applicant\u2019s statements credible. He had numerous opportunities to disclose \nhis interpretations in the written SF 86 and to the investigator during his January 2023 \ninterview but failed to do so. He clearly stated his past uses were marijuana. He was \nspecifically asked how he ingested the marijuana and he said he always smoked it. He \nsaid he did not use oils or edibles. He never mentioned to this investigator that his usage \nwas CBD. Applicant stated in his October 2021 interview that he purchased the marijuana \nfrom a friend. He does not mention that he purchased CBD. He does not explain if his \nmarijuana use was medicinal why he was purchasing it from a friend. I find Applicant \ndeliberately falsified material facts during his subject interview in January 2023. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not make a prompt good-faith effort to correct his omissions and \nfalsifications. Applicant\u2019s conduct is not minor. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. The \ngovernment relies on those holding security clearances to disclose the information \nrequested. Applicant is well educated. His character letters reflect that he works on \ncomplex programs and is involved in cutting edge issues. The government expects \npeople to be honest and forthright when responding to questions and not parse varied \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterpretations of relatively simple questions.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse and Guideline E, \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On April 12, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Service (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The CAS acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec.

He stated that his \nincome had tripled in the last eight months preceding his receipt of the SOR, going from \n$40,000 per year to $120,000 per year. He also stated that his credit advisor had advised \nhim to wait until he made a down payment on a home before beginning to pay off his \ndelinquent debts. He has followed the advisor\u2019s advice. The record does not reflect the \ncredentials or qualifications of his credit advisor. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he had traveled overseas as \na tourist in December 2017, July 2017, December 2018, and April 2019. (FORM Item 3 \nat 29-39) He did not explain how he financed these trips, which occurred after he stopped \nmaking payments on the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c and before he \nexperienced his significant increase in income. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare numerous, recent, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely \nto recur. He attributed his financial problems to low income, but he submitted no evidence \nof reasonable actions to resolve his debts after his income substantially increased. He \nappears to have received financial counseling, but he provided no evidence of the \nqualifications of his financial advisor, and there are no indications that his financial \nproblems are being resolved. He has not disputed any of the debts, and he submitted no \nevidence of efforts to resolve them. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him or \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On \nMarch 13, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F.

Items 2 \nthrough 6 are admitted into evidence. Applicant did not respond to the FORM. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 29, is an employee of a DOD contractor who is seeking to maintain \nhis security clearance. He has worked for the same employer in an overseas location \nsince July 2022. He served on active duty in United States Army from May 2014 to August \n2017. He separated with an honorable discharge. He has a high school diploma and some \ncollege credits. He married in 2016 and has three step-daughters. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent debts, with a combined approximate total of \n$32,392, to include: a $14, 661 charged-off automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Item 4 at 2; Item \n5 at 2; Item 6 at 4); a $12,354 charged-off account owed to a credit union for another \nautomobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 4); a $1,826 charged-off \naccount (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Item 3 at 4; Item 5 at 2); a $1,722 charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.d: \nItem 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2); a $1,228 cellphone account that was placed for collection (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e: Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 4); a $295 charged-off credit card account (SOR \u00b6 1.f: Item 4 \nat 5; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 5); a delinquent cellphone account in the amount of $170 placed \nfor collection (SOR \u00b6 1.g: Item 5 at 3); and a $136 account placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h: Item 4 at 4) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.e. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f \u2013 1.h.  With regard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.d, he claimed the company has permanently closed. He claimed he cancelled \nthe credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and no longer uses it. He denied the $1,228 cellphone \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g because he transferred to another provider. He is not sure \nwhere the debt came from. Finally, he denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h because he \ndid not recognize the debt. \nApplicant did not provide evidence indicating that he is attempting to pay or resolve \nany of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. In his response to the SOR, he indicated \nhe really needs a security clearance so he can keep his job. He briefly stopped paying \nhis debts because he arranged to put his wife and children into a house before he went \noverseas for his job and focused on his essential expenses. He claimed the debts owed \nto the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d were paid. He did not provide proof that the debts \nwere resolved. He is currently looking into debt consolidation. He hopes to pay everything \noff all at once.

His \nrecent period of unemployment was from October 2021 and July 2022. After separating \nfrom active duty, he was unemployed from August 2017 to October 2018. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns. \nThe disqualifying conditions that are relevant to Applicant\u2019s case include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 19(a) and AG \u00b6 19(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h. The total approximate balance of the delinquent debt is $32,392. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non in the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies, in part, because Applicant encountered several periods of \nunemployment which were circumstances beyond his control. However, the mitigating \ncondition is given less weight because I cannot conclude he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances because he made no attempts to resolve any of the delinquent debts. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are ongoing. He failed to initiate a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He did not \nmitigate the concerns raised under Financial Considerations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s honorable active-\nduty service in the United States Army. I considered that periods of unemployment \nadversely affected his finances. However, he failed to show that he made any attempts \nto resolve his delinquent accounts.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

AG \n\u00b6 24 sets forth the concern, as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C.\u00a7 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any \nof the behaviors listed above. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions or factors: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance . . . \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nabuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. \nThe only potentially applicable mitigating factor here is quoted below: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances, and possession of it is regulated \nby the federal government under the Controlled Substances Act. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 811 et seq. \nThe knowing or intentional possession and use of any such substance is unlawful and \npunishable by imprisonment, a fine or both. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844.

James R. Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, Memorandum: \nAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use (October 25, 2014). See also \nhttp://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml \nMore recently, on December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed \nthe memorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana \nfor Agencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that federal \nlaw remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production and \ndistribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive position \nare prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior medicinal, or recreational marijuana use) remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nHallucinogenic mushrooms are Schedule I controlled substances under 21 U.S.C. \n.\u00a7 812 (c). \nApplicant admitted using marijuana with varying frequency from about May 1998 \nto September 2022. He admitted to using marijuana from March 2019 to April 2023 while \nholding a position of public trust. In 2019, his frequency of use was 5 to 10 times per year. \nIn 2022, that frequency had increased dramatically to 10 to 15 times per month. He used \nmushrooms about three times in July 2021 and July 2022, also while holding a position \nof public trust. He was inconsistent about future drug use if his clearance was at stake, \nbecause he said unequivocally that he had no plans to stop using those controlled \nsubstances. \nFacts admitted by an applicant in an application, an answer to an SOR, or in an \ninterview require no further proof from the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 4, 1995). Applicant\u2019s years of past use of marijuana, his recent use of \nmushrooms, and his intent to keep using them trigger disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), (c), (f), and (g). \nI have considered mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a). On this record, Applicant began \nusing marijuana 25 years ago. Therefore, the inception of his use was long ago. Applicant \nhas, however, continued his regular, and not infrequent, use of marijuana. In fact, the \nfrequency of his use has increased significantly between 2019 and 2022. And he has \nadded mushrooms to his menu of controlled substances. His history of drug involvement \nand substance misuse shows an inability and certainly an unwillingness to comply with \nfederal law and casts doubt on his trustworthiness and reliability. Applicant\u2019s use of \ncontrolled substances is not mitigated by AG \u00b6 26(a). \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified material facts on a July 19, 2018 public \ntrust application by failing to disclose his marijuana and mushroom use. There is no July \n19, 2018 public trust application in the record. Therefore, the Government has not \nestablished SOR \u00b6 2. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe record raises doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand ability to protect sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1)-(9) and 2(f)(1)-(6). Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has not \nmet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.f: \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n AGAINST APPLICANT  \n Withdrawn \n Against Applicant \n FOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant access to sensitive information. \nPhilip J.

The case was assigned to me on November 15, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 51 years old. She earned an associate degree in 2006 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. She has been married since March 2000 and has two children, \nages 22 and 18. (Item 2) \nApplicant has been employed by a federal contractor as a financial analyst since \nJuly 2022. From September 2017 to December 2021, she was employed by the \nDepartment of the Navy as a hardware acquisition lead. She was suspended without pay \nfrom that position from December 2021 to March 2022 and resigned in March 2022. She \nwas unemployed until July 2022. She was previously employed by government \ncontractors from May 2005 to September 2017, with a period of unemployment from \nMarch to August 2014. (Items 2-3) \nFinancial Considerations, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant fraudulently withdrew $9,724 from \nthe bank account of a youth activities club between 2017 to 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that, \nin 2017, she began to gamble to obtain funds to pay back the money she had taken. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.a (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a), and that in about 2021 she was charged with two counts of Felony Theft and ordered \nby the court to pay $20,000 in restitution (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-\nalleges the conduct in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1 and 2 (SOR \u00b6 3.a). Applicant admitted all the allegations \nin the SOR, with some explanations. (Item 1) \nApplicant volunteered as concession coordinator and treasurer for a youth \nactivities club from 2012 to March 2020. From 2017 to 2019, she wrongfully issued club \nchecks totaling about $10,000 that were made payable to herself or to others for her \npersonal expenses, including a home mortgage, auto loan, and utilities. During this same \ntimeframe she began to play the lottery with the hope of winning enough money to pay \nback the money she had stolen from the club before anyone noticed. She started by \noccasionally spending $20 to $50 on lottery tickets or playing lottery numbers and \nprogressed to playing lottery games every other day and spending $100 to $200 per week \non lottery tickets. (Items 1-5) \nIn 2019, the new club president discovered some club funds were unaccounted \nfor. He informed board members and Applicant that about $10,000 in club funds were \nunaccounted for, and that it would be investigated.

(Item 4 at 2-3) Each offense was \npunishable by up to five years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. Each charge alleged \nthat from about January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, Applicant stole $9,754 from the \nyouth club. The first charge included the additional language that her theft was \u201cpursuant \nto a scheme and continuing course of conduct.\u201d A local news outlet reported her name \nand case details the next day. (Items 4-5) \nOn September 8, 2021, Applicant sent an email to a Navy security official admitting \nshe had made fraudulent withdrawals from the youth league bank account totaling \n$9,724. She also stated that: \nMy family was struggling at this time and I didn\u2019t want to lose our house or \nour means of transportation to get to and from our employment. At the time \nI was struggling with a gambling addiction. Once my husband found out, I \nalmost lost my family and everything else. He has stood beside me, and I \nhaven\u2019t gambled in over a year and a half. As distorted as it is, my thought \nprocess at the time was, I would win enough gambling to back anything I \ntook from the [club] account plus more. I know this doesn\u2019t sound right, but \nmy mind was messed up at the time. I do believe these charges will be \ndropped or dismissed, as full restitution will be made to the league. Per my \nattorney, there is a possibility that the [district attorney] may say that we \nneed to pay more to league, and we are prepared to do that if that is what \nit takes to make this go away. I have never been so ashamed and \ndisappointed in myself. I have never been in any trouble before and fully \nintend to never be in any trouble again, ever. (Item 4 at 1)  \nApplicant disclosed she had been charged with stealing money from a youth \norganization in her August 2022 security clearance application (SCA). During a November \n2022, subject interview (SI) with a government investigator, she made the following \nstatements. She started stealing club funds because she could not pay the family\u2019s \nmonthly expenses after her husband\u2019s commission-based income dropped from $5,000 \nto $2,000 a month. She did not tell her husband that she could not pay the family\u2019s bills \nbecause she did not want to hear from him about why they did not have enough money \nwhen their shortfall was attributable to his income reduction. She acknowledged that her \ngambling during this timeframe did not help their financial situation but wanted to play \nbecause of the chance to win big and to repay the stolen money. She denied stealing the \nfunds to support her gambling or being addicted to gambling and said she did not go to \ngamblers anonymous. She was never late on her bills from 2017 to 2019. She stopped \nstealing club funds and quit playing the lottery in 2019 after her pay increased and her \nhusband found a better paying job. Although she was then able to pay the family\u2019s monthly \nbills, she did not have sufficient funds to start repaying the stolen club funds. She did not \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ntell anyone about her misconduct, including her husband, until after she was fired as club \ntreasurer in March 2020.

She estimated that she paid the settlement in about July 2021 but provided no \ndocumentary evidence of a settlement agreement or restitution payment. Based upon her \nstatement to Navy security personnel, I find that no restitution payment was made before \nSeptember 8, 2021. She said she paid restitution with funds obtained through loans. She \nreported in her SCA and told the government investigator that the charges were dropped \nand had been expunged from her record. In November 2022, she told the investigator the \ncharges had been expunged in December 2021 and that she would provide evidence. \nThe government investigator reported receiving documents subsequently provided by \nApplicant including \u201cexpungement paperwork, copies of her bank statement to show proof \nof payment to [her friend], and [her] loan paperwork\u201d and the investigator reported \nattaching those documents to the SI, but those documents were not included in the FORM \nor submitted by Applicant. (Item 2 at 33-34, Item 3 at 6-10, 12)  \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant explained that it had been more than three years \nsince she stole from the youth club and that she \u201cwas not ordered by the court to pay \nrestitution, this was an agreement between myself and the organization.\u201d (Item 1 at 4) \nHer response to the FORM included the following: She reiterated that \u201cpayment of the \nfunds was by agreement and not court ordered as the case never went to trial [and that \nshe] was willing to make any restitution required to make things right. As far as the \ngambling, I was not a gambler before the incident, and I have not gambled in almost 3 \nyears.\u201d She noted that she had always intended to repay the money; that she can be \ntrusted to report negative conduct because she had reported this incident in the past and \nhad previously reported an old bankruptcy to a prospective employer. She acknowledged \nexercising poor judgement and said her actions negatively affected her entire life. She \nsaid that nothing like this would ever happen again and that her trustworthiness, \njudgement, and reliability had not otherwise been called into question during her \napproximately 30 years of working for the government or as a government contractor. \nShe stated her desire to continue supporting the government. Her responses to the SOR \nand FORM did not include any supporting documentary evidence.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994); see also ISCR \nCase No. 18-00496 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019) (citations omitted). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see also AG \u00b6 2(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n(i) concealing gambling losses, family conflict, or other problems caused by \ngambling. \nAG \u00b6 19(d) is established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence. While \nnot an \u201cemployee\u201d of the youth charity, she served as a volunteer treasurer of the \norganization, and committed intentional financial breaches of trust by stealing money from \nthe organization for her own purposes over a period of two years. \nThe record evidence is insufficient to establish AG \u00b6 19(i). Although Applicant \nadmitted that she spent from $20 to $200 a week on lottery games and stated that she \nwas simultaneously struggling with an addiction to gambling, she later contradicted that \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstatement.

Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \nThe record supports the following findings: (1) From 2017 until December 2020 \nApplicant used her position of trust as club treasurer to steal about $10,000; (2) she \nstarted playing the lottery to win money to repay those stolen funds and to conceal her \ntheft; (3) in 2019 or early 2020 she was informed the club president was investigating \nmissing club funds and she was removed as club treasurer in March 2020 by the club \npresident after he determined she had stolen about $10,000; (4) Applicant did not disclose \nher theft scheme to anyone until after she was fired as treasurer; (5) in about May 2020 \nshe was informed by local police that she would be charged for stealing about $10,000 \nand hired an attorney; (6) in August 2021 she was served with two felony charges for her \nthefts, summoned to appear in court in October 2021, and a local news outlet reported \nher name and case details; (7) in September 2021, she admitted stealing the youth club \nfunds to Navy security officials and said she did so because of family financial difficulties \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhile noting she was also struggling with a gambling addiction (an addiction she later \ndenied), reported her attorney had advised the charges might be dismissed if she made \nrestitution and she stated her willingness to do so; (8) in her August 2022 SCA she \nreported the charges had been dismissed and expunged; (9) in November 2022 she told  \na government investigator that she had paid $20,000 restitution with borrowed funds, said \nthe charges had been expunged in about December 2021, and the investigator reported \nreceiving and attaching copies of her \u201cexpungement paperwork, copies of her bank \nstatement to show proof of payment to [her friend], and [her] loan paperwork\u201d to her SI, \nbut copies of those documents were not submitted by Applicant or Department Counsel; \nand (9) the record does not include any documentary evidence of Applicant\u2019s settlement \nagreement with the youth club or of payment of restitution.  \nCollectively, Applicant\u2019s conduct reveals an individual who repeatedly showed an \nunwillingness to comply with the law, rules, and regulations; who exercised poor \njudgment; and who engaged in criminal or deceptive behavior and abused a position of \ntrust to steal funds. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s pattern of misconduct and concealment \nwas recent and did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. Her \nalmost two-year period of illegal financial practices and behavior cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s underemployment was beyond \nher control, but her decision to steal from an organization she served as treasurer was an \naction within her control. Her gambling in an effort to repay those stolen funds and her \nother efforts to conceal her misconduct were not responsible actions. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not appear fully applicable and are not established. \nAlthough Applicant may have paid restitution, there is no evidence that she received \nfinancial or gambling counseling. Her failure to pay any restitution until after her thefts \nwere discovered, and then only after she was charged with two felonies and with \nknowledge those charges could be dismissed if she did so, does not constitute a good-\nfaith effort to resolve the matter. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying that is applicable in this case: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence show \nthat she was charged with two felonies under state law because of her misconduct from \n2017 to 2019. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b) There is insufficient evidence to find she was court-\nordered to pay restitution in the amount of $20,000, the only part of an SOR allegation \nshe denied. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition is fully established for the reasons set out in the \nabove discussion of potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline F. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, willingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information, and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \ntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's \ntime or resources. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d) are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and record \nevidence. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNeither mitigating condition is fully established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of Guidelines F and J. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F, J \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to her eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuidelines F, J, and E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On May 12, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency Consolidated Adjudications Services (DCAS CAS) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns under Guideline J, Criminal \nConduct; and Guideline E, Personal Conduct.

Applicant admitted each of \nthe allegations set forth in the SOR, except 2.a., which he failed to answer, and 2.b., \nwhich he denied. Applicant began working for a defense contractor in October 2022. \nHe applied for a security clearance for the first time in November 2022. \nApplicant started using marijuana in about 1996, at the early age of 15, while in \nhigh school. In about May 2005, he was charged with Possession of a Controlled \nSubstance, (methamphetamine) and Possession of Marijuana. Applicant\u2019s car was \npulled over by police and during the search of his vehicle, they found marijuana and \nmethamphetamine. Applicant claimed the methamphetamine was not his. He was \nconvicted of Possession of Marijuana. (Tr. p. 21.) He was placed in a diversion \nprogram for the charge of Possession of a Controlled Substance and placed on \nprobation for a period of five years.  \nIn about June 2007, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence of \nAlcohol. Applicant testified that prior to the arrest, he consumed about a case of beer \nand a bottle of liquor. He was convicted of the offense, placed on probation for a period \nof five years, and ordered to complete an 18-month alcohol program. Following the \narrest, Applicant tried to stop drinking and was completely sober for about one year. \n(Tr. p. 39.) Then, little by little he returned to heavy drinking.

Applicant \nwas in violation of his five-year probation imposed by the court in 2005 for his earlier \nconviction. Applicant was convicted of this offense, and placed on probation for another \nfive years. \nIn about October 2009, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence \nof Alcohol. \nHe was convicted of the offense, placed on house arrest, placed on \nprobation for a period of five years, and ordered to complete an 18-month alcohol \nprogram. Following this arrest, Applicant stopped drinking for about a year and a half. \n(Tr. p. 44.) When he started consuming alcohol again, this time it was different. He \nwould force himself not to leave the house if he was drinking alcohol. He would only \nbuy a six or twelve pack at a time if he went to the store. This pattern has continued to \nthe present. He reduced his alcohol consumption but continued to drink and at time to \nexcess. \nIn June 2018, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. \nApplicant explained that he was out of town and went to visit a friend who does not \ndrink. Applicant wanted to relax and celebrate his birthday, so he purchased a six pack \nof beer and consumed it. Later that evening, Applicant went to the store to purchase \nanother six pack of beer and was pulled over by police. He was intoxicated at the time. \nHe was convicted of the offense, ordered to complete a DUI program, and sentenced to \n10 days in jail and five years of probation. He has recently completed probation for the \noffense. Following this arrest, he was able to remain sober for five or six months before \nreturning to consuming alcohol.  Now, he only drinks socially.  \nIn response to interrogatories dated April 10, 2023, Applicant stated that he last \nconsumed alcohol in June 2018. \nThis statement is not accurate since Applicant \nreturned to drinking some five or six months following the 2018 arrest for DUI. (Tr. p. \n51.) He deliberately failed to disclose that he consumed alcohol approximately monthly \nand that he continues to consume alcohol to the present. \nApplicant has not been formally diagnosed as an alcoholic, but he has seriously \ncontemplated the issue. This is the main reason he tries to abstain from drinking \nbecause he does not want it to control his life. \nHe has not received inpatient or \noutpatient treatment for his alcohol problem but he has thought about it. He has not \nreceived therapy or counseling for his drinking problem. \nHe has not attended an \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting for about a year. \nApplicant stated that he is trying to improve himself and his lifestyle. Since 2018, \nhe has obtained his high school diploma. \nHe graduated from an apprenticeship \nprogram through work, and he enrolled in community college to try to get an Associate \nDegree in Airframe Structures.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an\nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted;\nand  \n \n \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant committed five violations of the law, each time resulting in a conviction. \nHe was convicted of three DUI\u2019s and two convictions for Possession of Controlled \nsubstances. In 2007, he also violated his five-year probation for DUI imposed by the \ncourt in 2005. The aforementioned disqualifying conditions have been established. \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance, with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFirst, Applicant is commended for completing the court-ordered requirements \nassociated with each of his convictions. He is also commended for the progress he has \nmade in obtaining his education to further improve his life. It is also noted that he is \ntrying to change his past lifestyle patterns by getting involved in church and finding other \ndistractions unrelated to drinking. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s criminal history involving \nalcohol and drugs remains very concerning. His most recent conviction occurred in \n2018, and his five-year probation has only recently been satisfied. He stated that he \ncontinues to consume alcohol even though following each of his three DUI convictions \nhe tried to stop drinking. He was successful for a period of time, before he relapsed and \nstarted consuming alcohol again. Presently, he still consumes alcohol and battles to \nmaintain control of himself when he is under the influence. In the future, with hard work \nand discipline, and possibly using resources available to him such as treatment \nprograms, counseling, therapy, and others, Applicant may be able to conquer this \nproblem and remain alcohol free. However, at this time, his long history of criminal \nconduct involving drugs and alcohol does not show the requisite good judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness necessary to be eligible for access to classified \ninformation and it presents doubts concerning his ability or willingness to abide by law, \nrules, and regulations. None of the mitigating conditions establish full mitigation. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nFirst, Applicant\u2019s criminal \nhistory of drug and alcohol abuse involving three DUI\u2019s and two marijuana possession \nconvictions show poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness. Then, Applicant \nwas not accurate in response to his interrogatories dated April 10, 2023, concerning the \ndate he last used alcohol. Applicant stated in his interrogatories that he last consumed \nalcohol in June 2018.  This was not true. He testified that following his last DUI arrest in \n2018, he was able to abstain from alcohol for about five or six months before he started \ndrinking again. \nHe currently still consumes alcohol. \nThere is no excuse for this \ndishonesty which calls his character into question. Considered in totality, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct precludes a finding of good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. To be \nentrusted with the privilege of holding a security clearance, one is expected to be \nhonest and truthful at all times, and to know and understand the rules and regulations \nthat apply to them, and to always abide by those rules. Under the particular facts of this \ncase, Applicant has not demonstrated this awareness. His drug and alcohol history as \nwell as his inability to be truthful in answering a question in response to the \ninterrogatories, shows a lack of honesty, integrity, good judgment or reliability. At this \ntime, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline J and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. To hold a security clearance \nis a privilege and not a right. While holding a security clearance one is expected to \nshow honesty, responsibility and good judgment at all times. \nApplicant has not \ndemonstrated a positive pattern of conduct and the level of maturity needed for access \nto classified information. At this time, he is not an individual with whom the Government \ncan be confident to know that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the \nright thing, even when no one is looking. Right now, he is not qualified for access to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information, nor is it certain that sensitive information will be properly \nprotected. Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with many questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Criminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with substantial comments, the factual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.) and the personal conduct allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Background Applicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a mechanical engineer with his current employer since November 2020. He previously worked for other employers as a line cook (June 2020 \u2013 November 2020); and meat department worker (August 2018 \u2013 May 2020). A 2016 high school graduate, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2020. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance. He has never been married.

Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 6, 2022, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). On December 5, 2022, an \ninvestigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interviewed him. On \nApril 5, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive); and \nDirective 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nDOD CAF adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \nOn April 6, 2023, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to him by the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) on May 8, 2023, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a period of \n30 days, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. In \naddition to the FORM, he was furnished a copy of the Directive as well as the Adjudicative \nGuidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM on May 12, 2023. His \nresponse was due on June 12, 2023. Applicant chose not to respond to the FORM, for \nas of June 15, 2023, no response had been received. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 1, 2023, and there was still no response to the FORM. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with substantial comments, the \nfactual allegations pertaining to drug involvement and substance misuse (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.c.) and the personal conduct allegation (SOR \u00b6 2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a mechanical engineer with his current employer since November 2020. He previously \nworked for other employers as a line cook (June 2020 \u2013 November 2020); and meat \ndepartment worker (August 2018 \u2013 May 2020). A 2016 high school graduate, he received \na bachelor\u2019s degree in 2020. He has never served with the U.S. military. He has never \nheld a security clearance. He has never been married. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and Personal Conduct \nApplicant was an illegal substance user whose substance of choice was marijuana \n\u2013 also known as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance.  \n(https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (c)) He first started \nusing marijuana in June 2016 while he was in high school, either alone or with a friend \napproximately one time every four months. His use of marijuana increased to daily while \nin college in October 2018, and he did so either alone or while with friends. Although \nApplicant contends that he was aware that smoking marijuana was illegal under federal \nlaw at the time he used it, he denied knowing that his employer \u2013 a defense contractor \u2013 \nhad a policy or procedure regarding marijuana use. (Item 4 at 4) Nevertheless, from \nSeptember 2020 until October 2020, in preparation of being hired by his current employer, \nand with the anticipation of being administered a drug test, he ceased his marijuana use. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce he was hired in November 2020, he resumed his daily use of marijuana. In \nSeptember 2022, in anticipation of obtaining a security clearance, he again purportedly \nstopped using marijuana. In April 2023, he claimed that he has not resumed using \nmarijuana. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 33-35; Item 4 at 3-4) \nApplicant claims that he has no interest in using marijuana in the future and no \nlonger socializes with individuals who use drugs illegally. (Item 2 at 1; Item 4 at 2) \nHowever, as noted by Department Counsel, as of June 2023, Applicant had not submitted \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, \nacknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national \nsecurity eligibility; and had not submitted verifiable proof that he had disassociated \nhimself from drug-using associates and had avoided the environments where drugs are \nused. \nApplicant initially purchased approximately 1/8th  of an ounce of marijuana ($35 per \npurchase) one time every four months from local area dealers whose names he could not \nrecall. In October 2018, he increased his purchases to 1/8th  of an ounce of marijuana ($60 \nper purchase) one time every three weeks from unnamed local dealers and recreational \ndispensaries. (Item 4 at 1) His marijuana purchases took place in three different states. \n(Item 3 at 35) \nThere is no evidence to indicate that Applicant ever reported his marijuana use to \nhis employer\u2019s security manager or to anyone else where he worked. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable, and unfavorable, in making a \nmeaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is because of this \nspecial relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high degree of trust \nand confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail \na certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, \nrisk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nAbuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nFurthermore, on October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \nissued Memorandum ES 2014-00674, Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana \nUse, which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (Reference H and I). An individual's disregard of federal law \npertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. As always, \nadjudicative authorities are expected to evaluate claimed or developed use \nof, or involvement with, marijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. \nThe adjudicative authority must determine if the use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana raises questions about the individual's judgment, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and willingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, \nincluding federal laws, when making eligibility decisions of persons \nproposed for, or occupying, sensitive national security positions. \nIn addition, on December 21, 2021, the DNI issued Memorandum ES 2021-01529, \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, which states in part: \n. . . disregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but \nnot determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. . .. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 . . ., Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 25 that could raise security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase; \nand  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nCommencing in about January 2016, Applicant used marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I \nControlled Substance \u2013 sometimes periodically but more frequently daily, until at least \nSeptember 2020 until October 2020. He stopped in preparation of being hired by his \ncurrent employer, and with the anticipation of being administered a drug test. Once he \nwas hired in November 2020, he resumed his daily use of marijuana, again stopping In \nSeptember 2022, in anticipation of obtaining a security clearance. In April 2023, he \nclaimed that he has not resumed using marijuana. During the periods of his marijuana \nuse, Applicant also purchased marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) have been established. \nWhile it appears that the position that Applicant has held since November 2020 might be \na sensitive position, there is no evidence other than speculative evidence that it is a \nsensitive position, and thus AG \u00b6 25(f) has not been established \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 26 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) minimally applies, but the other mitigating condition does not apply. As \nnoted above, Applicant progressed from a periodic marijuana user to a daily marijuana \nuser. Nevertheless, from September 2020 until October 2020.

Once he was hired in November 2020, \nhe resumed his daily use of marijuana. In September 2022, in anticipation of obtaining a \nsecurity clearance, although he claimed to have no knowledge of any employer policy or \nprocedure regarding marijuana use, he again purportedly stopped using marijuana. In \nApril 2023, he claimed that he has not resumed using marijuana. \nAlthough Applicant claims that he has no interest in using marijuana in the future \nand no longer socializes with individuals who use drugs illegally, Applicant had not \nsubmitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; and had not submitted verifiable proof that he had \ndisassociated himself from drug-using associates and had avoided the environments \nwhere drugs are used. \nIf Applicant\u2019s abstinence in 2020 had continued, there would be no security \nclearance eligibility issues before us today. But his abstinence was only temporary to \navoid any possible urinalysis if he had been given one. Once the probability of a random \nurinalysis passed, he resumed his daily use of marijuana. However, a similar situation \narose when he was sponsored for a security clearance. He again supposedly stopped \nusing marijuana in September 2022. During his December 2022 OPM interview, he \nclaimed to have no future interest in marijuana. To his credit, Applicant did report his use \nof marijuana on his SF 86 and discussed that use candidly with the OPM investigator. \nHowever, after repeated efforts to evade the system with temporary periods of \nabstinence, Applicant has offered no verifiable justification to believe him now. \nA person should not be held forever accountable for misconduct from the past. \nContinued abstinence is to be encouraged, but, when balanced against his full history of \nmarijuana use, the relatively brief period of reported abstinence is considered insufficient \nto conclude that the abstinence will continue, especially after so many temporary \ninterruptions indicating that he would no longer use marijuana. Applicant\u2019s use of \nmarijuana for such a lengthy period, even though such use was prohibited by both the \nFederal Government and government contractors, continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 16: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse are \nadopted herein. In fact, the cross-allegation under Guideline E refers to one of the \nallegations under Guideline H, and the credible adverse information alleged under \nGuideline H is sufficient for an adverse determination solely under that single guideline. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) has been established, along with the general concern under AG \u00b6 15 that \nApplicant\u2019s conduct involves questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations that raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition under AG \u00b6 17 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from personal conduct. It includes: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur.  \nThe condition does not apply. Applicant has acknowledged using marijuana for \nseveral years. He is aware that marijuana is illegal on the federal level but denied knowing \nthat it was prohibited while employed as a DOD contractor. Ignorance of the law is no \nexcuse. While he has acknowledged the behavior involving repeated use of marijuana, \nhe has never obtained counseling to change his behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that motivated him to indulge in using \nmarijuana. He has failed to furnish any verifiable evidence to support his claimed \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nabstinence. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case considering the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 24-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a mechanical engineer with \nhis current employer since November 1920. He previously worked for other employers as \na line cook and meat department worker. A 2016 high school graduate, he received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2020. Applicant was candid in his SF 86 and spoke freely with the \nOPM investigator regarding his marijuana use. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant started using marijuana \u2013 a Schedule I Controlled Substance \u2013 in January 2016 \nand progressed from being a periodic marijuana user to a daily marijuana user. From \nSeptember 2020 until October 2020, in preparation of being hired by his current employer, \nand with the anticipation of being administered a drug test, Applicant temporarily ceased \nhis marijuana use. Once he was hired in November 2020, he resumed his daily use of \nmarijuana. In September 2022, in anticipation of obtaining a security clearance, although \nhe claimed to have no knowledge of any employer policy or procedure regarding \nmarijuana use, he again purportedly stopped using marijuana. In April 2023, he claimed \nthat he has not resumed using marijuana, but has offered no verifiable evidence to \nsupport his claim. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his drug \ninvolvement and substance abuse and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) \n(1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The case was assigned to me on July 17, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 62 years old and a high school graduate. He has been married three \ntimes, and the most recent marriage (March 2010) ended in divorce in April 2021. He has \nan adult adopted son. Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 1985 \nuntil August 1997 when he received an honorable discharge. Since February 1998, he \nhas worked for the same defense contractor. He held security clearances in that position \nsince 2004. Before that, he held clearances in the U.S, Navy for 12 years. (Items 5 and \n6; Response.) \nThe SOR alleged 11 delinquent consumer accounts totaling $32,172. (Item 1.) \nApplicant admitted those allegations, stating: \u201cI have attempted to make payment \narrangements with [the collection agent for the first five debts ($16,619)] but they wanted \nhalf of the total up front and I do not have it at this time. I am working to save money and \ntry again.\u201d (Item 4.) This collection agent filed a judgment against him for $12,644 in \nAugust 2021. (Item 10.) The SOR accounts went into collection in the spring of 2020. The \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports support the SOR allegations. (Items 7-9.) Applicant disclosed \nhis debts in his SCAs. (Items 5 and 6.) \nIn his January 10, 2023 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant explained his \ncurrent financial difficulties. His problems began in about March 2019 and continued into \n2020. His spouse owned a rental property. The tenants left the rental with unexpected \ndamages that cost him $1,300 to repair. His spouse worked for a medical contractor, but \ndue to the COVID pandemic her contractor lost business. Her pay was cut by 50%. He \nhad to pick up some of her financial obligations. Applicant had relied on overtime, but due \nto the COVID pandemic and technical reasons, the project that afforded him overtime \nwas unexpectedly cancelled. That adversely impacted his income. Those financial \nsetbacks strained their marriage. Then his spouse left him, and they divorced in April \n2021. That also caused a further strain on his finances. (Item 11; Response.) \nIn his PSI, Applicant acknowledged that when he started missing his bill payments, \nhe did not respond to his creditors. He also hesitated to contact a debt counselor, because \nhe thought it might adversely affect his security clearance. He has made no attempts until \nrecently to contact his creditors. He began working overtime again in February 2022.

Before their financial issues arose, he and his spouse did live \nbeyond their means. (Item 11.) They made enough, however, to support their expenses. \n(Response.)  \nApplicant intends to pay his creditors by focusing first on the judgment creditor. At \nthe time of his PSI, he had negotiated a settlement with the judgment creditor to make a \n$6,870 down payment followed by $950 per month for a total of $13,741 with interest. He \nwas unable to document that agreement, because he has not yet begun payments. He \nwas working towards accumulating the funds necessary for the down payment. (Item 11.) \nIn his May 26, 2023 Response, Applicant reiterated the causes of his financial \ndifficulties and that he is saving funds for the down payment. He also enumerated the \nnumerous Navy achievement medals, service ribbons, good conduct medals, and \ncitations he was awarded in his 12 years in the U.S. Navy. He also noted his professional \nachievements during his 25 years working for the same defense contractor, where he \nrose from a technician to an upper level manager. In those capacities, he trained \nnumerous personnel in the proper handling of classified material. In those 37 years, he \nnever had a security incident. (Response; Items 5 and 6.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and his credit \nreports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Having reviewed all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, \nI find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts went \ninto collections in the spring of 2020. That is not that long ago. The debts are numerous \nand remain in default today. His debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). First, the financial problems \nmust have been caused by conditions \u201clargely beyond\u201d an applicant\u2019s control. Second, \nthe applicant must have acted responsibly under the adverse conditions he confronted.  \nThere were multiple causes of Applicant\u2019s financial woes. The tenants of his \nspouse\u2019s rental property vacated it leaving $1,300 worth of unexpected damages that he \nhad to repair to make it habitable. Next, his spouse worked in the medical business. The \neconomic impact of the COVID pandemic on her employer caused her pay to be reduced \nby half. Then, the project he had been relying on for overtime pay was unexpectedly \ncancelled due to COVID and technical reasons. All those financial hardships strained the \nmarriage. He and his spouse separated and then divorced in April 2021. That too harmed \nhim financially. The foregoing conditions were largely beyond his control. Applicant has \nsatisfied the first element of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe second element asks whether the applicant has acted responsibly under the \nadverse circumstances he confronted. Here, Applicant elected to address first the debts \nowed to the judgment creditor. That was not an irresponsible choice. But because he has \nyet to make any payments under the agreement with that creditor, he cannot document \nthat agreement. The Appeals Board has routinely held that it is reasonable to expect \napplicants to produce documentation supporting their efforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). In addition, without having made any \npayments under that agreement, he has not established \u201ca meaningful track record\u201d that \nthe Appeals Board requires to conclude that an applicant is on track to resolve unpaid \ndebts. The Appeals Board has stressed the importance of a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d \nthat includes evidence of actual debt reduction through the voluntary payment of accrued \ndebts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-\n01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). His debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have given full and positive weight to Applicant\u2019s 12-year Naval career and his \n25-year career in the private defense industry. He served the Navy commendably and \ncontinued that high caliber of service in the private sector. Applicant leaves me, however, \nwith questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under these \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nparticular circumstances.

He received a master's degree in 2020, has been married since 2019, and \nhas one child. (Item 2 at 12-13, 14, 22.) \nGuideline H  \nApplicant admits to a five-year history of marijuana use. In response to DOHA \ninterrogatories issued to him after his January 2023 security clearance interview, he listed \nDecember 2022 as the last time he used marijuana. (Item 3 at 8.) The window of use \nextends several months after he submitted his September 2022 e-QIP. (Response; Item \n3 at 4.). In his Response he modified his prior answers. He admitted he first tried \nmarijuana in 2017 but because he was a football player and did not want to lose his \nscholarship, he did not use marijuana from April 2017 until May 2020. (Response.) He \nbegan using marijuana again in May 2020 to help mitigate the pains associated with a \n2019 shoulder surgery and subsequent rehabilitation and exercises. He specified in his \nResponse: \n\u2026 I only used it for extremely painful times (i.e., once every couple of \nmonths).

Lastly, January \n2022 - December 2022 would follow the same frequency as years prior. As \nmentioned in my e-QlP, my last intake of marijuana was December of 2022. \nPrior to that date, I had not participated in marijuana since July of 2022. \nApplicant admits to \"vaping\" marijuana with friends with whom he still associates. \nHe volunteered he would mitigate his use of marijuana by changing his sleeping habits \nand seeking other medical relief for his pain and discomfort as well as stretching and \nmodifying his workouts. (Item 3 at 4; Response.)

He affirms that that any participation in illegal drug use would \u201cderail\u201d him \nfrom being able to complete his job. He states since his last use in December of 2022, he \nhas \u201cdisassociated\u201d himself from the drug. (Response; Item 3 at 4, 8.) \nPolicies \nThe standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nSEAD 4, \u00b6 E.4. A person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nadjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in \nconjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt will be resolved in favor of national security. The Government must \npresent substantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for assignment to a public trust position. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe record establishes use of marijuana between April 2017 to about December \n2022 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline, as detailed in AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement Administration listing at http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr/cfr/1308/ \n1308 11.htm. See also Gonzales v. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual's behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana may have ended in \nDecember 2022. However, he had submitted his security clearance application on \nSeptember 22, 2022, and continued to use marijuana. His drug involvement is recent. \nMedicinal use of marijuana is not permitted under federal law.

He provided no evidence to support this \ndeclaration. He still socializes with the friends he vaped with. His issues with marijuana \nare too recent and too serious to be considered mitigated. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to establish that the security concern regarding his drug involvement \nis mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public \ntrust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \nraised by his drug involvement. Accordingly, I conclude that he has not carried his burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant him eligibility for a \npublic trust position. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegation in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

The \ncase was assigned to me on November 8, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c on \nthe basis the amounts were wrong. He admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d.

The evidence concerning his taxes is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax \nyear 2016 in the amount of $38,423. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR he does not deny \nthe delinquency. (Item 6 at 26.) He denies the delinquent amount. With his Answer he \nincluded an IRS-processed payments history (payment history) showing payments \nthrough August 25, 2021.

During the period reflected \non the payment history he made over $129,000 in payments to the IRS for tax year 2010 \nbetween September 2016 and August 2021.

In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he does not \ndeny the delinquency but denies the delinquent amount. (Item 6 at 30.) He states the \ndelinquent amount is $17,211. The payment history did not show any tax year 2017 \npayments. As noted above, he was making payments towards tax years 2010 and 2011. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax \nyear 2018 in the amount of $80,779. In Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, he does not \ndeny the delinquency but denies the delinquent amount. (Item 6 at 31.) He states the \ndelinquent amount is $18,756.

He states in his Answer that \u201call returns required \nby the IRS have been filed and are being processed to determine my outstanding balance \ndue, if any, \u2026.\u201d As part of his Answer, he offered a letter dated June 27, 2023, from the \nFirm he hired to assist him in completing these outstanding tax returns. The Firm stated \nit had sent the tax returns in question to the IRS and that the IRS had granted a hold on \nany collection enforcement until July 27, 2023, to allow the tax returns to be processed. \n(Answer at 3.) In his Answer he cites his multiple moves between 2007 and 2020; being \ndisorganized; and \u201cnot being disciplined enough to keep track of important papers\u201d for \nwhy he had not filed the tax returns in question. He explained that when he was working \noverseas his spouse would forward the mail and he would misplace the papers. He states \nhe hired the Firm to make the necessary tax filings with the IRS so he can negotiate a \npayment plan to resolve his tax debt. (Answer.) \nThe Firm stated it had \u201cadvised [Applicant] to pay a lump sum amount to lower the \nthreshold of the total amount due to under $250,000.00.\u201d (AE A.) He included an IRS \ntransaction receipt dated October 5, 2023, showing the IRS had accepted a $11,104 \nlump-sum payment. (AE B.) The Firm stated the IRS Collections unit had advised them \nthat after the payment processed and had been deducted from the total amount owed by \nApplicant for the various tax years, then Applicant would begin to make $3,500 monthly \npayments commencing on or around the November timeframe. (AE A.)  \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15- 01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- \n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . Affluence that cannot be explained \nby known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nresult from criminal activity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax debts and past-due tax \nreturns are numerous, recent, and did not occur under circumstances making them \nunlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant made over $129,000 in payments for tax \nyear 2010 between September 2016 and August 2021. He attributed his current tax \nissues to having two households and the difficulty maintaining his records during multiple \nmoves. His tax problems were not caused by conditions beyond his control.

The Firm stated any potential \npayment agreement would not commence until at least November 2023, after the IRS \nhad processed and accepted the delinquent tax returns. To establish a meaningful track \nrecord of debt reform, an applicant is required to demonstrate that he has established a \nplan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00504 at 3. After considering all the record evidence and \nthe favorable evidence of a onetime payment towards the alleged tax debt and his history \nof payments on a nonalleged tax debt, I find these favorable actions are outweighed by \nthe unfavorable evidence of a lack established payment agreement with the IRS. The \nprospect of a future payment plan standing alone does not mitigate AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and 20(g) \nand resolve the all security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3\u20134 (App. \nBd. Mar. 7, 2018). \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established for SOR \u00b6 1.d. Accepting the Firm\u2019s October 2023 \nletter that Applicant had recently filed his tax returns for the years in question, this \nfavorable action is outweighed by the unfavorable evidence of his repeated to failure to \nfulfill his legal obligations to file tax returns in multiple years (tax years 2012, 2013, 2014, \n2015, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022). Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to fulfill his legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n08782 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2017).  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s payment agreement with \nthe IRS, and the evidence of some action by a tax professional are mitigating factors, but \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthey are insufficient to overcome the security concerns raised by his long history of tax \ndelinquency, dating back to 2012. Because Applicant requested a determination on the \nrecord without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity \nbased on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his Federal tax debts and failure to timely file his Federal \nincome tax returns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.
