Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nOctober 27, 2009\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP), on March 3, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1). On February 12, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) concerning the\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by President Bush on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on March 19, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non June 10, 2009. I received the case assignment on June 11, 2008. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on July 1, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on July 28,\n2009. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received\n\n2\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and requested that the record\nstay open for presentation of additional information. The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit A, which was received without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on August 7, 2009. The record closed on August 7, 2009. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 55, and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he\nis financially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. The Applicant admits allegations 1.a., 1.b., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g.,\n1.m., 1.n., 1.o., and 1.p. of the SOR. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of\nfact. He denied allegations 1.h., 1.i., 1.j., 1.k., and 1.l.\n1.a.\nThe Applicant admits that he filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy protection on\nJanuary 8, 2007. This bankruptcy was dismissed on February 28, 2007. According to\nthe Applicant, he filed for bankruptcy because of a mistake by an escrow company. This\nescrow company failed to pay the second trust deed holder on a piece of property\nbought by the Applicant for his daughter. In order to prevent a foreclosure sale of the\nhouse, the Applicant filed for bankruptcy protection almost simultaneously with the\nescrow company issuing a check. The daughter failed to make future mortgage\npayments and the house was eventually subject to a foreclosure. (Government Exhibit 2\nat 2-8; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 12-18, 37-41; Transcript at 25-31, 59-61.)    \n1.b.\nThe Applicant admits filing for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection in about\nJuly 1998. He was discharged of all dischargeable debts in November 1998. He filed\nthis bankruptcy because his income was reduced due to a reduction in force at his\nemployer. (Government Exhibit 2 at 10; Government Exhibit 3 at 4; Transcript at 31-33.)\n1.c.\nThe Applicant admits that he was indebted to an individual in the amount\nof $723. This was the result of a lawsuit. The Applicant submitted documentation\nshowing that this debt was paid. (Government Exhibit 2 at 11-12; Transcript at 33-34.)\nThis allegation is found for the Applicant.\n    \n1.d.\nThe Applicant admits that he is indebted to a loan company in the amount\nof $2,582. This was the result of an automobile repossession and subsequent lawsuit.\nThe Applicant has made no payments on this debt, and has no current plans to make\npayments on this debt. (Government Exhibit 2 at 13-14; Transcript at 35-39.)\n\n3\n1.e.\nThe Applicant admitted that he is indebted to a medical provider in the\namount of $31. The Applicant alleged that he was making payments on this account\nthrough a hospital. (Government Exhibit 2 at 15; Transcript at 39-42.) The Applicant\nprovided a credit report dated August 4, 2009. (ACR.) (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 2-11.)\nThat credit report showed the debt to this creditor as still being due and owing.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 6.) Based on all of the available evidence, I find that this debt\nhas not been paid.\n1.f.\nThe Applicant admitted that he is indebted to a medical provider in the\namount of $3,143. The Applicant alleged that he was making payments on this account\nthrough a hospital. (Government Exhibit 2 at 15; Transcript at 39-42.) The\nGovernment\u2019s most recent credit report, dated July 28, 2009, showed the debt to this\ncreditor as still being due and owing.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 2.) Based on all of the\navailable evidence, I find that this debt has not been paid.\n1.g.\nThe Applicant admitted that he is indebted to a medical provider in the\namount of $155. The Applicant alleged that he was making payments on this account\nthrough a hospital. (Government Exhibit 2 at 15; Transcript at 39-42.) The ACR showed\nthe debt to this creditor as still being due and owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 5-6.)\nBased on all of the available evidence, I find that this debt has not been paid.\n1.h.\nThe Applicant denied owing a telephone company $160 for a past due\naccount. He testified that he had no knowledge of this account and was disputing this\ndebt with the credit reporting agencies. (Transcript at 42-43.) The ACR actually shows\nfour different collection agencies collecting separate debts for this telephone company.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 4-5.) The debt to the collection agency in this allegation of the\nSOR is stated to be $424 in the ACR. The Applicant is stated to be a co-borrower on\nthis account. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 5.) Based on all of the available evidence, I find\nthat this is the Applicant\u2019s debt and that it has not been paid. \n1.i.\nThe Applicant denied owing a cable television company $147 for a past\ndue account. He testified that he had no knowledge of this account and was disputing\nthis debt with the credit reporting agencies. (Transcript at 42-43.) The ACR actually\nshows two different past due accounts for this cable company, both with the same\ncollection agency. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 6.) The second debt is stated to be in the\namount of $58 in the ACR. The Applicant is stated to be either a borrower or co-\nborrower on these accounts. Based on all of the available evidence, I find that this is the\nApplicant\u2019s debt and that it has not been paid. \n1.j.\nThe Applicant denied owing a credit card company $413 for a past due\naccount. He testified that he had no knowledge of this account and was disputing this\ndebt with the credit reporting agencies. (Transcript at 42-43, 62.) The ACR shows this\ndebt and states that the Applicant is a borrower on the account. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at\n5.) Based on all of the available evidence, I find that this is the Applicant\u2019s debt and that\nit has not been paid. \n\n4\n1.k.\nThe Applicant denied owing a telephone company $418 for a past due\naccount. He testified that he had no knowledge of this account and was disputing this\ndebt with the credit reporting agencies. (Transcript at 42-43.) As stated above, the ACR\nactually shows four different collection agencies collecting separate debts for this\ntelephone company. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 4-5.)  The ACR does not show a debt in\nthis exact amount. However, based on all of the available evidence, I find that this is the\nApplicant\u2019s debt and that it has not been paid. \n1.l.\nThe Applicant admits that he owed a utility company $676 for a past due\ndebt. He stated that he had made a payment arrangement with the utility and was\nfulfilling his responsibility. The credit reports supplied by the Government and the\nApplicant show this as a paid, or paying, charge off. (Government Exhibit 6 at 2-3;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 6, 32; Transcript at 45-46, 62-63.) This allegation is found for the\nApplicant.\n1.m.\nThe Applicant denies that he owes a loan company $12,605 for a\ndelinquent real estate loan. He states both of his houses have been foreclosed on and\nsold. Indeed, he alleges that this creditor sold the house for more than the deficiency\nand the Applicant is owed money. None of the documents the Applicant supplied\nsupport this version of events. The ACR, as well as other credit reports, shows this debt\nas being due and owing. (Government Exhibit 2 at 16; Government Exhibit 6 at 2;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 4; Transcript at 46-49, 59-61.) Based on all of the available\nevidence, I find that this is the Applicant\u2019s debt and that it has not been paid.\n1.n.\nThe Applicant denies that he owes the Internal Revenue Service $678 for\nback taxes. The available evidence shows that the Applicant had an earlier Federal tax\nlien released in the amount of $5,163. However, none of the available evidence shows\nthat the most current Federal tax lien has been paid or released. (Government Exhibit 3\nat 3; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 7, 31; Transcript at 49, 64-67.) Based on all of the available\nevidence, I find that this debt has not been paid.\n1.o.\nThe Applicant admits that he owed a collection agency the amount of\n$4,941. He states that the company sued him, obtained a judgment, and that the\njudgment was satisfied. He submitted court documents, including an \u201cAcknowledgment\nof Satisfaction of Judgment,\u201d  that was filed by a different named creditor. The Applicant\nstates that this is the same creditor, but did not submit any documentation in support of\nthis statement. (Government Exhibit 2 at 18; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 32-33; Transcript at\n49-53.) Based on all of the available evidence, I find that this debt has not been paid.\n1.p.\nThe Applicant admits that he owes $1,535 for a past due credit card\naccount. The Applicant states that he is disputing the amount he owes. This account\nhas not been paid, and the Applicant has no current plans to pay this debt. (Transcript\nat 53, 69.)\nDuring his testimony, the Applicant was often unclear about the state of his\nfinancial affairs. As stated above, the documents he presented at the hearing, and\nafterwards, do not always support his version of events.\n\n5\nThe ACR also shows additional delinquencies of the Applicant. There are at least\neight debts showing as charge offs or collection accounts that are not specifically\nalleged in the SOR. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A at 4-6.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\n\n6\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. The Applicant, by his own admission, or as found by me, has over\n$26,000.00 in past due debts, all of which have been due and owing for several years.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ The Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties are of a longstanding nature. As stated above, he has paid off\nseveral of his debts. However, the evidence is meager as to how he is going to pay his\nremaining past due debts.  It is the Applicant\u2019s burden to submit evidence showing that\nhis financial situation has improved.  He has not done so.  This mitigating condition is\nnot applicable to this case.  \nThe Applicant has barely initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.\nThere is no track record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.\nAccordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is at least\n$26,000.00 in debt, I cannot find that \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is\nbeing resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\n\n7\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The Applicant is under financial\nstrain, and has been for several years. The most recent credit report in the record,\nsupplied by the Applicant, shows additional past due debt which is not alleged by the\nGovernment. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find that there\nhave been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the\npresent time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8)), and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude the\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation at\nthis time.  If he continues to pay down his debts, and is able to document these\npayments, he may be eligible for a clearance in the future.  He is not eligible now.\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l.:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He admits that from 2001 until \n2004, he mismanaged his money and had no financial understanding of the \nramifications of accruing delinquent debt through credit cards. (Tr. 24-27) \n \n \nBased on credit bureau reports (CRB) dated June 2008 and February 2009, the \nSOR alleged seven delinquent debts, totaling $14,652. The status of the debts is as \nfollows. \n \n \n1.  SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $6,747 judgment owed to a university credit union. This \ndebt was a personal loan for an automobile he purchased in December 2004.  \nThe debt remains unpaid, but Applicant has been in contact with the creditor. \nHe intends to pay it when money becomes available. (Tr. 32-33; AE H) \n \n2. SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a $373 debt owed to a cell phone company.  This debt was \npaid on May 22, 2009. (Tr. 33; AE C) \n \n3. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a $2,584 debt owed to a credit card company. The original \ndebt was $500. This was Applicant\u2019s first credit card, which he received in \n2002. He has made two offers to the company for settlement. AE I is a \nsummary of those offers. He is waiting for a reply. (Tr. 33-36; AE K)  \n \n4. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $78 debt owed to an insurance company. This debt was \npaid on March 31, 2009.  \n \n5. SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $775 debt owed to a credit card company.  This debt \nwas paid in May 2009. (Tr. 37; AE E) \n \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n6. SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $3,389 debt owed to a university for room and board for \nthe year of 2005. This debt was paid on May 15, 2009. (Tr. 38; AE F) \n \n7. SOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a $706 debt owed to a storage company. This debt was \npaid on March 30, 2009. (Tr. 39; AE G) \n      \n   \nIn summary, Applicant paid five of the seven debts since March 2009. He has \ncontacted one of the two remaining unpaid creditors and will pay the debt when he \nreaches a settlement.  He intends to contact the other creditor and start making small \nmonthly payments if acceptable by the creditor. (Tr. 49) He anticipates that the \nremaining debt of $9,461 will be resolved and paid within the next nine months. (AE K) \n \n \nApplicant has not participated in a formal credit counseling course, but has \nreceived financial advice from his father. He has also taken accounting and finance \ncourses in conjunction with his business management program. (Tr. 57-78)  \n      \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant started his current full-time position as a head server at a \nrestaurant. He also attends school full time. He and his wife are managing on their tight \nbudget through frugal spending. (Tr. 44-45) He has not incurred any additional debt \nsince 2004 other than his car loan, which he pays regularly. (Tr. 55) If he obtains a \nsecurity clearance, he will begin work as a team leader for a federal contractor and \nmany of his financial problems will be resolved with a higher salary. His prospective \nemployer has held a position open for Applicant over the last year.  (Tr. 30, 47; AE L) \nHe also intends to continue working at the restaurant on a part-time basis to help pay \nhis two outstanding debts. (Tr. 55) \n \n \nApplicant testified candidly and credibly. He presented his case in a very \norganized manner and demonstrated a commitment to achieving financial solvency. He \nwas an impressive 26-year-old man who will have a successful career in the future. \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an  \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department counsel and \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nBetween 2001 and 2004, Applicant accumulated approximately $14,652 of \ndelinquent debt that he was unwilling or unable to pay until sometime in March 2009. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and, \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \nApplicant accumulated several debts between 2001 and 2004 that were the \nresult of poor financial management and imprudent use of credit cards. He did not begin \nresolving them until 2009. Because the debts are not isolated and have been ongoing \nfor several years, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant admitted that he mishandled his \nfinances during that period of time. Hence, AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant has not \ntaken a formal financial counseling course, but has spoken to his father and completed \ncollege courses in accounting and finance as part of his business management \ncurriculum. Based on that and other evidence, there are clear indications that the debts \nare being resolved and his finances are under control, triggering the application of AG \u00b6 \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n20(c). Applicant paid five of the seven debts and is negotiating with another creditor. \nThose actions are evidence of his good-faith effort to resolve the debts and warrant the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(d). There is no evidence to support the application of AG \u00b6 20 (e) \nor AG \u00b6 20(f).  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a 26-year-old man who \nmismanaged his money and credit when he was 19-years-old and attending college. \nSince learning of the Government\u2019s security concerns, he has demonstrated a \ncommitment to resolving those debts. Given his awareness of the importance of \nfinancial responsibility and effect similar problems could have on future employment, \nalong with a frugal budget, I do not believe similar financial problems will recur. The \nAppeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 06-12930, \u201cthat an applicant is not required to \nshow that she has completely paid off her indebtedness, only that she has established a \nreasonable plan to resolve her debts and has taken \u2018significant actions to implement \nthat plan.\u2019 ISCR Case No.04-09684 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jul.6, 2006).\u2019\u201d In this case, \nApplicant has taken steps to resolve his delinquent debts and establish a track record of \nresponsible financial management.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude \nApplicant \nmitigated \nthe \nsecurity \nconcerns \narising \nunder \nfinancial \nconsiderations.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through g: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 12, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 4, 2009, and reassigned to me on March 11, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 17, 2009, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on April 8, \nMay 27, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3, which were received without \nobjection. The Government also offered a demonstrative exhibit which was marked \nHearing Exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Exhibits \n(AE) A through L, which were received without objection. The record was held open \nuntil April 17, 2009, for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted \nsix pages of documents, which were marked AE M through P, and admitted without \nobjection. Appellant requested an additional three-week extension to submit \ninformation. Department Counsel did not object to an extension through May 8, 2009. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memorandum is marked HE II. I orally granted an extension to \nMay 8, 2009. Applicant submitted an additional nine pages of documents, which were \nmarked AE Q through X, and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s second \nmemorandum is marked HE III. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nApril 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since about August 2005. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air \nForce from 1980 to 2000, when he retired as a technical sergeant (E-6). He worked for \nanother defense contractor from about August 2000 through August 2005. He has \ncollege credits, but has not attained a degree. He was married from 1980 until his \ndivorce in 2001. He married again in 2004. He has three children from his first marriage, \nages 27, 24, and 21. He has a four-year-old child with his second wife, and he has two \nstepchildren, ages 19 and 11.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts, totaling $37,837. Five debts total $3,283, \nand there is one large debt of $34,554. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthat they were all his debts, with the exception of the $280 medical debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.f. He indicated that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e had been paid. He \nalso provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security \nclearance.   \n \n \nApplicant encountered some financial difficulties during the time of his divorce \nand for a period thereafter. The cost of maintaining two households after 21 years of \nmarriage placed a financial toll on him. Applicant bought a mobile home for about \n$38,000, and the land on which it was located for another $50,000. The mobile home \nwas rented to tenants. The tenants stopped paying rent after about six months. When \nthe tenants were finally removed from the home, it was discovered that they had \nseverely damaged the mobile home. Applicant repaired the mobile home to the best of \nhis ability and attempted to sell it. The only offers he received were for less than he \nowed on the home, and he did not have the funds to make up the deficit. He was able to \nsell the land, but he could not maintain the payments on the mobile home and it was \nrepossessed. The April 16, 2008 and October 8, 2008 credit reports list the balance on \nthe mobile home loan as $34,554. Applicant believes that was about the balance due on \nthe loan at the time of the repossession. Both reports list the high credit on the loan as \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 23, 45-52; GE 1. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n$46,680. Applicant indicated that he is willing and able to address this debt, but he \nwants a full accounting from the creditor as to what he truly owes. He stated that his \nbrother who works in the industry told him that the mobile home sold for about $22,000. \nApplicant believes that would leave a deficiency owed of between $10,000 and $15,000. \nThe debt was sold to another creditor. He has been in contact with the new creditor \nattempting to obtain specifics from them about the debt. He was told over the telephone \nthat he owes $34,553, which included \u201c$25,000 for repair fees, breakdown, moving \nfees, and miscellaneous charges.\u201d The creditor sent him a letter which indicated that the \nloan balance at the time of repossession was $79,453, minus the sale proceeds of the \nrepossessed mobile home of $44,900, leaving a balance due of $34,553. Applicant \ndisputes these figures. It is noted that there is a discrepancy between the credit reports \nand the letter from the creditor. Applicant credibly and persuasively testified that he will \nsatisfy this debt as soon as he receives a complete accounting, or when the company \nagrees to accept the $10,000 to $15,000 that Applicant believes is due.2   \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent debt of approximately $332 to an apartment \ncomplex. Applicant rented an apartment when he was working at a different \ngeographical location than his family, and went home for the weekends. He decided it \nwould be cheaper to live in a trailer. He was given permission to leave before the end of \nhis 12-month lease. He was unaware that he was charged a half-month\u2019s rent. He paid \nthe full $332 to satisfy the debt on November 7, 2008. He paid the $127 debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b on November 6, 2008. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent debt of $424 to a \ncollection company on behalf of a telephone services provider. Applicant settled this \ndebt in full with payments of $185 on April 9, 2009 and $215 on April 27, 2009. He \nsettled in full the $2,120 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, with a payment of $400 on August \n8, 2008.3 \n \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $280 medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He stated \nthat it was a dental bill incurred by his adult son who has the same first, middle, and last \nname. He contacted the creditor and the creditor agreed to remove the debt from his \ncredit report. The debt is listed on the April 16, 2008 credit report, but not the more \nrecent credit report of October 10, 2008.4 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He earns a good salary and does \nnot live a lavish lifestyle. He is saving money and contributing to his retirement \naccounts. He has the means and ability to address his last remaining debt. There was a \npossible issue with his ex-wife over her not paying him child support and she not \nreceiving her share of his military retirement. He indicated that they have worked that \nissue out and he does not foresee it escalating into a problem. He has not received \nfinancial counseling except for some Air Force training in the early 1980s.5 \n                                                          \n2 Tr. at 25-31, 52, 61-62; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE C, L, N, R, U.  \n \n3 Tr. at 31-36; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A, B, D, N, R, S, T, X. \n \n4 Tr. at 36-37; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n5 Tr. at 37-45, 53-59; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; AE F, G, I, J, N, R. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant spent much of his Air Force career in the special operations \ncommunity. He was involved in many humanitarian, combat, and highly classified \nmissions. His DD Form 214 reflects more than ten years of foreign service. He retired \nwith numerous awards, medals, and decorations, including the Distinguished Flying \nCross, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal with one device, and the Air Force \nCommendation Medal with Valor, among many others. He submitted 17 character \nletters from his current supervisors and many from individuals that he served with \nthroughout his military career, including in combat. He is described as a leader, honest, \nethical, trustworthy, loyal, dedicated, responsible, reliable, professional, and a man of \nintegrity who will always do the right thing. He is highly recommended for a security \nclearance.6  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n                                                          \n6 AE E, G, H, J, O. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nThe SOR listed six debts. Applicant paid or settled in full four debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) \nis applicable to those debts, as a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors. He \nsuccessfully disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to that debt. The \nremaining debt of concern is the large debt owed on the loan for his repossessed \nmobile home. The actions of his tenants qualify as conditions that were outside his \ncontrol. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has yet to pay that debt, but he is \nworking with the creditor for an equitable amount for him to pay. He is seeking a \ncomplete accounting of the debt. That is not an unreasonable request considering the \ndiscrepancies between the credit reports and the letter from the collection company. I \nam satisfied that he will resolve this debt once the specifics are finally worked out. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) is partially applicable. With the exception of the mobile home loan, Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation is very stable. While his financial problem is not completely resolved, \nthere are clear indications that the problem is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially \napplicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nserved in the Air Force for 20 years. He served in peace and in wartime, earning awards \nfor his valor in combat. Applicant resolved five of the six debts in the SOR. He still has \none, albeit by far the largest, debt to resolve. The Appeal Board has noted that an \napplicant is not required to establish that he has paid every debt listed in the SOR. All \nthat is required is that an applicant must demonstrate that he has \u201cestablished a plan to \nresolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d7 \nApplicant credibly testified that he intends to pay the mobile home loan debt. I find that \nhe has established a plan to resolve his financial problems and has taken significant \naction to implement that plan. His finances do not constitute a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Applicant is 59 years old and has been employed as an equipment repair mechanic for a defense contractor for over 31 years. He has been married for over 40 years and has three adult children. He has held a security clearance for at least ten years (Item 5, e-QIP, dated May 14, 2008).

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) May 14, 2008, as a requirement for his employment with a defense contractor \n(Item 5). On February 18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns for \nfinancial considerations under Guideline F (Item 1). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March \n26, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on both April 22, 2009 (Item 2), and June \n24, 2009 (Item 3). Applicant denied the first allegation (SOR 1.a), but admitted the \nsecond allegation (SOR 1.b). He provided an explanation for his answers and attached \na receipt for payment of the debt listed at SOR 1.a. Applicant did not indicate in his \nresponse whether he wanted the case decided on the record or in a hearing before an \n \n1 \n \n \nNovember 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadministrative judge. On August 7, 2009, he elected to have the matter decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on August 19, 2009. On September 4, 2009, Applicant \nreceived a complete file of relevant material (FORM), and was provided the opportunity \nto file objections, and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions. Applicant did not provide additional material. The case was assigned to me \non November 9, 2009. Based on a review of the case file and pleadings, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nI thoroughly reviewed the case file, and the pleadings. I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 59 years old and has been employed as an equipment repair \nmechanic for a defense contractor for over 31 years. He has been married for over 40 \nyears and has three adult children. He has held a security clearance for at least ten \nyears (Item 5, e-QIP, dated May 14, 2008). In response to Interrogatories from security \nadjudicators, Applicant provided a personal financial statement. He reported monthly \nincome of $5,391.36, verified by an earnings statement from his employer (Item 6 at 4). \nHe has monthly recurring expenses of $1,641.89. The mortgage on his house is paid, \nso he reports additional monthly expense of $795.38 for property taxes, homeowner's \ninsurance, and a car payment. He has a net monthly remainder of $2,954.09. He listed \nassets of $322,300, for the equity in his house, savings bonds, and stock (Item 6).  \n \nCredit reports (Item 7, Credit report, dated July 15, 2009; Item 8, Credit report, \ndated February 6, 2009; Item 9, Credit report, dated November 17, 2008; Item 10, \nCredit report, dated May 28, 2008) show a charged off delinquent debt for $48,000 \n(SOR 1.a), and a house foreclosure on a mortgage default of $187,000 (SOR 1.b). \nThere is no indication in the file of the origin of the debt at SOR 1.a. Applicant provided \na receipt showing that the debt was settled for $4,801.11 and paid. The debt is not listed \non the latest credit report (Item 7). Applicant's house, that he lived in for over 30 years, \nis mortgage free having been paid in full. Applicant states that the mortgage in SOR 1.b \nis for his son's house. Applicant co-signed the mortgage on the house for his son. His \nson was not able to continue to make the mortgage payments so it will be foreclosed. \nApplicant also stated that his son was negotiating with the lender for a more affordable \nmortgage (Items 2 and 3). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s two delinquent debts reported in credit reports raise Financial \nConsiderations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts); and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances).There are only two delinquent debts for Applicant listed in \ncredit reports. Even though there is no indication of the origin of the debt at SOR 1.a, \nApplicant has provided sufficient information to establish that this debt is settled and \npaid. The debt at SOR 1.b is attributed to Applicant because he co-signed for his son's \nmortgage and the son defaulted. This event will not likely recur since Applicant's co-\nsigning the mortgage was a one time event. Applicant acted responsibly towards his \npersonal finances. He paid all debts directly attributed to him, and pays his present \ndebts as agreed. He has a significant savings safety net. \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). There is no indication Applicant received financial \ncounseling or that he even needed financial counseling. However, he does not have a \nfinancial problem since his finances are under control. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay any overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\". Applicant has no debt except \nfor the mortgage attributed to him because he co-signed his son's mortgage. A \nsystematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed. Good-faith means acting in a \nway that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation. Applicant presented information to show that his management of his \npersonal finances is reasonable, prudent, and honest. He has managed his finances in \nan excellent fashion that he has no debt except for his financial liability from his desire \nto assist his son by co-signing a mortgage for his son. Applicant presented sufficient \ninformation to establish he is making a good-faith effort to pay creditors and resolve his \ndebts. His finances are under control and he acted reasonably and responsibly in \nregard to his finances. He mitigated security concerns for financial considerations. \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nAppellant has to show a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts. All that is required is that \nhe has a plan to resolve his financial problems and takes significant action to implement \nthat plan. The entirety of his financial situation and his actions can reasonably be \nconsidered in evaluating the extent to which his plan to reduce his outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about the person's \nbehavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in \nreaching a determination.  \n \nApplicant established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment by presenting \nsufficient information to show he is current with his debts except for one that is basically \na debt for his son. He is taking sufficient, consistent, reasonable, and responsible action \nto properly manage his finances. He basically has no debt except for one debt more \nattributed to his son than to him. Applicant demonstrated by his lack of personal debt \nreasonable and responsible management of his finances. It is apparent Applicant has a \ndebt for the co-signed mortgage that he must resolve with mortgage creditor. The fact \nhe has this debt does not show he should not be granted access to classified \ninformation. The circumstance of this debt does not indicate Applicant's finances show \npoor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. \nApplicant lived within his means for many years as indicated by the facts he has no \ndelinquent debt and has substantial discretionary funds available each month. He paid \noff the mortgage on his own house and accumulated a savings in the form of stocks and \nbonds. Applicant's overall financial picture shows he does meet his financial obligations. \nThe way he managed his finances over the years indicates that he will be concerned, \nresponsible, and not careless in regard to classified information. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nand trustworthiness. He established that he is suitable for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Appellant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial situation. Clearance is granted. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact DOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes delinquent credit card debt totaling $17,986 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i), a wireless telephone debt of $186 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and medical debt totaling $1,350 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e). Applicant admitted the debts with the exception of the wireless phone debt that he believed had been paid. He expressed his intent to resolve his debts, and explained that he had been unable to work after injuring himself on the job five years ago and had difficulty finding employment before he accepted his current position. After considering the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits entered into the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 45-year-old assembler who has been employed by a defense contractor since June 2008 (Ex. 1, Tr. 35-36). He seeks a security clearance for his duties, never having previously held a security clearance (Ex. 1). Applicant and his spouse have been married for 16 years. They live with their three children, ages 15, 14, and 13, who have been educated in a local parochial school (Ex. 1, Tr. 40-41). Applicant inherited the home that he lives in with his spouse and children (Tr. 51). They have refinanced their mortgage loan several times, using the equity in their home to pay off debt obligations (Tr. 60). They have been late in their 1 mortgage payments a few times but not more than 60 days (Ex. 3, Tr. 51). As of November 2008, the balance of the mo",

Borgstrom, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started after he was injured on the job in April\n2004.  He paid down credit card balances with a sizeable insurance settlement received\nin early 2007, but he fell behind on several accounts. Subsequent difficulties finding full-\ntime employment hampered his ability to address those debts, and repayment of\ndelinquent property taxes has taken priority since January 2009. He intends to resolve\nhis delinquent debts once he is in a position to do so. Clearance is granted.                 \nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on May 15, 2008. On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\nJune 26, 2009\n\nApplicant\u2019s credit reports list several mortgage loans. A joint mortgage loan of $84,500, taken out in\n1\nAugust 2001, was late 30 days before being paid off through an individual mortgage loan of $124,300 opened\nin January 2003. That loan was paid off through a new individual mortgage of $142,000 in March 2004. Twice\nApplicant was late 60 days in making his $909 monthly mortgage payment, including in August 2004. In\nNovember 2005, Applicant and his spouse took out a joint mortgage loan of $167,700. They made their $1,115\nmonthly payments on agreed upon terms and that loan was paid off through refinancing in February 2007. As\nof November 2008, the principal balance of their current mortgage was about $193,000 (Ex. 2, Ex. 3).\n2\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006.\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 11, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR allegations in writing on February 23, 2009, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on April 2, 2009. On April 17, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for\nMay 7, 2009.\nThe hearing was convened as scheduled. The government submitted four\nexhibits (Ex. 1-4), which were admitted without any objections. A table prepared by\nDepartment Counsel to assist in reviewing the financial record information was marked\nas a hearing exhibit but considered as an addendum to his oral argument. Applicant\nsubmitted one exhibit, and he and his spouse testified on his behalf, as reflected in a\ntranscript (Tr.) received on May 14, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant owes\ndelinquent credit card debt totaling $17,986 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i), a\nwireless telephone debt of $186 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and medical debt totaling $1,350 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.c, 1.d, and 1.e). Applicant admitted the debts with the exception of the wireless phone\ndebt that he believed had been paid. He expressed his intent to resolve his debts, and\nexplained that he had been unable to work after injuring himself on the job five years\nago and had difficulty finding employment before he accepted his current position. After\nconsidering the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits entered into the record, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 45-year-old assembler who has been employed by a defense\ncontractor since June 2008 (Ex. 1, Tr. 35-36). He seeks a security clearance for his\nduties, never having previously held a security clearance (Ex. 1).\nApplicant and his spouse have been married for 16 years. They live with their\nthree children, ages 15, 14, and 13, who have been educated in a local parochial school\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 40-41). Applicant inherited the home that he lives in with his spouse and\nchildren (Tr. 51). They have refinanced their mortgage loan several times, using the\nequity in their home to pay off debt obligations (Tr. 60).  They have been late in their\n1\nmortgage payments a few times but not more than 60 days (Ex. 3, Tr. 51). As of\nNovember 2008, the balance of the mortgage loan was $193,000 (Ex. 2). The car and\nmortgage loans are in his spouse\u2019s name (Tr. 69-70).\n\nApplicant does not dispute that he and/or his spouse incurred the charges on the account for\n2\nmiscellaneous household expenses.\nApplicant\u2019s June 2008 credit report (Ex. 3) shows a $2,000 credit card balance paid off as of\n3\nSeptember 2007. He could have used the settlement to satisfy that debt. However, another credit card with\na high balance of $9,800 was reported to have a zero balance as of February 2005, well before he would have\nreceived the settlement monies. Similarly, his Discover card debt of $9,105 had been settled for less than the\nfull balance as of April 2004. It is unclear to what extent credit card balances were reduced through the\nsettlement funds.\n3\nApplicant worked as a production associate for a technology company from\nSeptember 1996 to August 2001 when he was laid off (Ex. 4). He was unemployed for\nabout a year. In September 2002, he went to work as a third shift supervisor for a\nmanufacturing company (Exs. 1, 4). While at work in mid-April 2004, he caught his arm\nin machinery causing serious injuries to his arm and upper extremities that left him\nunable at present to lift weight over five pounds on his left side (Ex. A, Tr. 51). His\nspouse was a student and caring for their children at the time and was not employed\noutside of the home (Tr. 32, 86). He collected workmen\u2019s compensation, almost the\nequivalent of his $12 hourly wage, from mid-May 2004 until January 2007 (Tr. 46). His\nspouse began working for his employer part-time (about 36 hours a week) in late June\n2004 to pay for extra expenses, including clothes for their three children (Tr. 33-34, 46,\n48, 85-86). In about January 2005, she took a second job full-time to supplement their\nincome (Tr. 86). In May 2005, her second job ended and she worked solely for\nApplicant\u2019s employer until about October 2005, when she left the company for a more\npermanent position with a contract company at higher pay. The plant was subsequently\nclosed and her job moved. Applicant\u2019s spouse left her job in about November 2006\nbecause she was tired of the long commute. In January 2007, she began working full-\ntime as a contract temporary employee for a computer manufacturer at $16 an hour (Tr.\n86-90). She was paid only for hours worked.\nOver the May/June 2006 time frame, Applicant opened the credit card accounts\nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b that he used for miscellaneous household expenses. In June\n2006, the account in SOR \u00b6 1.h was opened with Applicant as an authorized user for\nthe same purposes.  In summer 2006, Applicant came down with a methicillin-resistant\n2\nstaph infection (MRSA) that required eight weeks of daily intravenous Vancomycin\ntreatment. Applicant was covered by medical insurance under his spouse\u2019s policy, but\nthe coverage was limited (Tr. 49, 95-97). The family subsequently qualified for the\nstate\u2019s medical insurance program (Tr. 112).\nIn November 2006, Applicant was medically cleared, but he continued to collect\nworkmen\u2019s compensation pending a hearing on his ability to work. In January 2007, he\nwas laid off by his employer without being given an opportunity to return to his old job\n(Tr. 33-34, 43). In late January or early February 2007, Applicant received an insurance\nsettlement of about $64,000 after paying attorney fees from his on-the-job injury (Tr.\n99). The money went to paying down the balances of about $15,000 in credit card debt\n(Tr.71),  car repairs, household items (Tr. 44), including a $1,900 computer for his\n3\nspouse (Tr. 76), their children\u2019s parochial school tuition (Tr. 100), delinquent property\n\nApplicant testified that his mother-in-law gave them about $7,000 to $8,000 for the down payment\n4\nfor a car for his spouse (Tr. 45) and that the funds to repay her came out of the settlement. His spouse testified\nthat $7,000 of the settlement money went for the down payment on Applicant\u2019s car (Tr. 101). She did not\nindicate that they borrowed any money from her mother at that time. W hether paid to her mother or to a\nlender, it appears that between $7,000 and $8,000 of the settlement monies was used to acquire a 2006\nmodel-year vehicle for the household.\n4\ntaxes (Tr. 75), and their mortgage (Tr. 72). They also paid back a $7,000 to $8,000 loan\nfrom his mother-in-law used to buy a new vehicle in about February 2006 (Tr. 45, 52).4\nApplicant\u2019s spouse earned no income for two to three weeks because of a death in the\nfamily (Tr. 73).\nDespite several job interviews, Applicant was unable to find full-time employment.\nHe suspects he was not hired because of his physical limitations (Answer, Tr. 34). From\nSeptember to December 2007, Applicant had a contract position, initially as a third shift\nsupervisor. He moved to second shift when the company ceased third-shift operations,\nbut he was unable to perform all the tasks required, and he was let go just before\nChristmas 2007 (Tr. 34-35). He was out of work until mid-June 2008, when he started\nwith his present employer at an hourly wage of $11.71 (Exs. 1, 2, 4).\nOn May 15, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP in conjunction with his present\nemployment. He responded \u201cYes\u201d to question 28.a concerning whether he had been\ndelinquent over 180 days on any debts in the last seven years, and to question 28.b\nconcerning whether he was currently delinquent over 90 days on any debts. Applicant\nlisted two delinquencies attributed to his unemployment, a $5,000 credit card balance\nthat was unpaid (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and a $1,500 secured loan satisfied in January 2007 (Ex.\n1).\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on June 13, 2008, showed the previously disclosed\ncredit card debt had a balance of $6,461 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He reportedly owed several other\ndelinquent debts: a $186 wireless telephone debt from May 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), a $1,241\ncredit card balance in collection since September 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), medical debts\nincurred because of his infection (Tr. 56) of $700 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) and $325 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) in\ncollection since May 2007, another medical debt of $325 in collection since April 2007\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), and a $307 revolving charge debt with a mail order company in collection\nas of May 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). A credit card account on which Applicant was listed as an\nauthorized user was in collection as of February 2008 with a balance of $3,915 (SOR \u00b6\n1. f) (Ex. 3).\nOn July 9, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nhis delinquent debts. He disputed only the wireless phone debt, which he speculated\nwas his father\u2019s account. The credit card accounts were used for the purchase of\nmiscellaneous household items, and with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.g, clothing for his spouse.\nHe indicated he was capable of meeting his household obligations, and he was getting\ncaught up to where he could begin to pay off his delinquent debts in the near future (Ex.\n4).\n\n5\nIn October 2008, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law purchased a car outright for $22,000\nfor Applicant\u2019s spouse. The car is in Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s name. She is supposed to be\nrepaying her mother at about $321 per month, but had not made any payments as of\nMay 2009 because she and Applicant were still catching up on other financial\nobligations. Applicant\u2019s spouse had been driving a 1999 model-year vehicle that needed\na new transmission (Tr. 106-08).\nIn response to financial interrogatories, Applicant provided a personal financial\nstatement on November 5, 2008, indicating a net monthly remainder of $26.40 after\nexpenses. He was making monthly payments of $929 on his mortgage, $272 on his car\nloan, and $190 in parochial school tuition for his children. Applicant provided\ndocumentation showing he had been approved for a hardship payment plan to resolve a\n$5,971.82 delinquent debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i) by paying monthly an amount that he could\nafford; that the creditor owed of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b wanted to discuss settlement\nterms with him;  and the creditor of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g was willing to accept $184.66\nto settle the debt provided payment was received by October 16, 2008. Applicant\nindicated that the wireless phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h had been satisfied, but that he and\nhis spouse were still trying to get caught up in their current bills. His credit report of\nNovember 7, 2008, listed those outstanding delinquent balances alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.a\u20131.g, but not the disputed wireless phone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h or the $5,971.82\nundisputed loan balance (SOR \u00b6 1.i) (Ex. 2).\n In early January 2009, Applicant and his spouse began working on a budget to\ndetermine what they could pay toward their delinquencies (Tr. 36, 68, 81). They had\nneither finalized a budget nor made any payments toward resolving their delinquent\ndebts as of May 2009 (Tr. 54-61). Applicant\u2019s latest contact with a creditor/assignee\nabout the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was in late 2008, and he is not sure who is presently\nholding that debt (Tr. 54). The collection agency for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is demanding\na 20% down payment to even discuss settling that debt (Tr. 55-56). He has made no\neffort to contact his medical creditors (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e) (Tr. 56-57), the credit\ncard lender owed the $3,915 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) (Tr. 58), or the retailer owed the $307 in SOR\n\u00b6 1.g (Tr. 59). Applicant has disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h with the telephone service\nprovider (Tr. 59). In early May 2009, he contacted the agent collecting the debt in SOR\n\u00b6 1.i, and was informed that the client wanted the balance paid off within six months.\nApplicant was rebuffed in his offer to make small monthly payments (Tr. 60-61).\nApplicant and his spouse use a debit card for household purchases now (Tr. 76,\n93). Applicant\u2019s spouse has a couple of credit card debts from the past on which she is\nmaking payments (Tr. 94). They have cut back on a few expenses (groceries, gasoline,\nschool lunches) to save money (Tr. 109).\nApplicant and his spouse owed back property taxes on their home of $4,000 that\nthey have been repaying since January 2009 at $400 a month (Tr. 36-37) with what little\nhe has of his income tax refund (Tr. 65). Applicant has not had any overtime available at\nwork since January 2009. His current hourly wage is about $12.30 (Tr. 37). His spouse\nstill works full-time as a temporary employee for the computer hardware manufacturer\n(Tr. 53). In March 2009, the company cut contractor\u2019s pay, including his spouse\u2019s, by\n\n6\n2.5% (from $18 to about $17.55 hourly) because of the economy (Tr. 89-90). Applicant\nintends to resolve his delinquent debt but with the property tax repayments and lack of\novertime, he does not have the funds to do so at present (Tr. 39). His two sons will be\nattending the local public vocational technical high school in the fall (Tr. 41), so he will\nno longer be paying parochial school tuition for them. The family has received tuition\nassistance from the parochial school since his accident in 2004 (Tr. 41). Applicant and\nhis spouse applied for scholarships and tuition assistance for their daughter for 2010 in\nthe hope of reducing the $3,000 tuition bill for next year (Tr. 79). As of early May 2009,\nApplicant had $1,200 in his checking account, but had outstanding checks that when\nprocessed would reduce the positive balance to $150 (Tr. 79-80).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security\nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines\n(AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative\nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are\nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These\nguidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the\ngovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and\nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or\nproven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of\npersuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\n\n7\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 of the\nadjudicative guidelines:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nAs of February 2009, Applicant owed about $17,800 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, 1.g,\nand 1.i) in consumer credit debt, and medical debt of $1,350 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e)\nthat became delinquent when he was unemployed in 2007. The evidence is insufficient\nto prove any ongoing liability for the $186 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. A $186 collection\nbalance appeared on his credit record as of June 2008 (Ex. 3). However, Applicant\nindicated during his July 2008 subject interview that he believed the debt was his\nfather\u2019s. He later claimed in November 2008 that it had been paid, and he provided a\ncredit report (Ex. 2) that did not include the alleged debt. AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d applies, but only as to SOR \u00b6 1.h.\nHis undisputed delinquent debts raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nAvailable information shows that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are recent and\nmore extensive than reflected in the SOR. About $64,000 in an insurance settlement\nreceived in early 2007 went to paying other debts not alleged in the SOR, including\nother outstanding credit card balances, parochial school tuition, and the mortgage. As of\nMay 2009, Applicant had not made any payments toward his admitted delinquencies\nbecause he was paying $400 per month in delinquent property taxes that were not\nalleged in the SOR.  AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\ndoes not apply.\n\nApplicant does not dispute that he and/or his spouse incurred the charges on the account for\n5\nmiscellaneous household expenses.\n8\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is pertinent. Applicant\u2019s financial\ndifficulties started for the most part after his serious on-the-job injury in April 2004. While\nhis workmen\u2019s compensation was almost the equivalent of his hourly wage, he lost\npotential overtime earnings and his spouse was not employed outside the home. In\nJune 2004, she began working part-time, and during tax season in 2005, she held a\nsecond job working full-time to pay their expenses. They managed to get by, paying the\nminimums on credit card balances (Tr. 72) and paying other obligations late. They were\nlate at least 60 days twice on their mortgage in 2004/early 2005, but after they\nrefinanced in November 2005, they made their monthly mortgage payments on time.\nOver the May/June 2006 time frame, Applicant opened the credit card accounts in SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b that he used for miscellaneous household expenses. In June 2006, the\naccount in SOR \u00b6 1.h was opened with Applicant as an authorized user for the same\npurposes.  Before they had an opportunity to get ahead financially, Applicant became\n5\ninfected with MRSA in summer 2006. Medical insurance through his spouse\u2019s employer\ndid not cover all of his care (see SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.e). Although he was medically cleared in\nNovember 2006, Applicant was not given the opportunity to return to work before he\nwas laid off in January 2007. Injury, illness, and job layoff are circumstances that\nimplicate AG \u00b6 20(b).\nAt the same time, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, Applicant must have acted\nresponsibly. The government has some concerns in this regard, because the debts at\nissue in the SOR became delinquent apparently after Applicant received about $64,000\nin an insurance settlement from his industrial accident. Applicant explained that the\nfunds went to pay his mortgage and parochial school tuition for his children, to purchase\na computer for $1,900, to reduce outstanding credit card balances totaling about\n$15,000 (Tr. 71), for car repairs, and to repay his mother-in-law for a $7,000 to $8,000\nloan for a down payment on a vehicle purchased in February 2006. He also indicated on\nhis SF 86 that he had paid off a secured loan of $1,500 in early 2007. Assuming\nmonthly mortgage and tuition payments of $929 and $190 similar to what he was paying\nin November 2008, this would account for only about $13,048 of the settlement monies.\nWith another $1,900 going to pay for the computer and $7,000 to $8,000 provided to his\nmother-in-law, Applicant would have had about $41,000 of the settlement monies for\ncredit card and other debt repayments and living expenses. Even if he paid $15,000 on\nold delinquent debt not evident in the record available for review, and $1,500 to satisfy\nthe loan listed on his SF 86, he would have been left with about $24,500. As of\nNovember 2008, he estimated his monthly expenses (excluding mortgage) to be\n$2,279. Although his $350 estimate of food for a family of five seems low, the balance of\nthe settlement should have been sufficient to cover their expenses for the nine months\nhe was out of work in 2007. Given the insurance settlement monies, Applicant\u2019s\nunemployment and history of low-wage earnings do not fully extenuate his failure to\nmake at least minimum payments on the accounts in the SOR to keep them current in\n\n9\n2007. However, Applicant\u2019s financial situation was again negatively impacted by his\nunemployment during the first half of 2008 when his spouse was making $16 to $17 an\nhour. It is understandable that he and his spouse would still be catching up on their\nexpenses as of late 2008, in light of his starting hourly wage of $11.17 in his present\njob. As of November 2008, he estimated they had only $26.40 per month remaining\nafter expenses. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.\nAs of May 2009, Applicant had made no effort to resolve his delinquent debts,\ndespite his expressed willingness to start paying on his debts by the end of 2008.\nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d\nnor AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply in this case. Applicant cannot afford the settlement\ndemands of the creditors at present because he is paying $400 per month toward his\ndelinquent property tax obligation. After the property tax debt is satisfied in October\n2009, his spouse will still be indebted to her mother in an amount of about $321 per\nmonth for a vehicle purchased for them in October 2008. Applicant\u2019s financial situation\nshould improve in the future because of the efforts to reduce expenses, and the use of\ndebit rather than credit for purchases, however.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person\nanalysis in financial cases stating:\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the\nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of\nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is\nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and\n\n10\nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant\ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial\nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge\ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation\nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for\nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See\nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past\nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching\na determination.\u2019). There is no requirement that a plan provide for\npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable\nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such\ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts\nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in\nthe SOR.\nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted).\nApplicant has not repaid the debts in the SOR, and he and his spouse are indebted to\nher mother for a car purchased for them in October 2008. Yet, it is not doubted that\nApplicant intends to resolve his debts. He satisfied in full or paid down the balances of\ncredit card accounts in 2007 with the funds from an insurance claim. He has made his\nmortgage payments on time, excepting for a limited period when he was out of work\nafter a serious industrial accident. Perhaps most significantly, he is not continuing to\nincur new delinquencies. Taking his financial situation as a whole, he has a meaningful\ntrack record of paying on his financial obligations.\nOne could reasonably argue that parochial school tuition, even at the reduced\nrate paid by Applicant, was an expenditure that the family could ill afford, especially\nduring Applicant\u2019s unemployment. Applicant obviously put his family\u2019s desires ahead of\nhis financial obligations to his creditors, but his financial problems were not due to\nextravagance. Showing that he understands the importance of paying his obligations,\nhis two sons will be attending the local public vocational technical high school in the fall.\nHe is not likely to jeopardize the job that he needs to support his family by engaging in\nillegal conduct to generate funds, or by incurring debt that he has no intent of repaying.\nOnce he pays off his delinquent property tax debt, he plans to begin making payments\non his other debts.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant a security clearance and/or assignment to sensitive duties. Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on April 2, 2008. On November 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. DOHA acted under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated December 15, 2009, Applicant requested a \ndecision on the record in lieu of a hearing. The government compiled its File of Relevant \nNovember 30, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nMaterial (FORM) on February 10, 2010. The FORM contained documents identified as \nItems 1 through 9. On February 16, 2010, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant, with instructions to submit any additional information and/or objections within \n30 days of receipt. Applicant received the file on June 24, 2010. He did not provide \nadditional information in response to the FORM. On October 20, 2010, the case was \nassigned to me for a decision.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains two allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline H, \nDrug Involvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). SOR \u00b6 1.a. alleges: \u201cYou used marijuana, \nwith varying frequency, from about 1999 to at least 2008.\u201d SOR \u00b6 1.b. alleges: \u201cYou \nused marijuana after being granted a DoD security clearance in October 2001.\u201d In his \nAnswer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the two Guideline H allegations and provided \nadditional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are entered as findings of fact.  (Item 1; \nItem 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old, never married, and has no children. In 2003, he \nreceived a Bachelor of Science degree in business. Since December 2007, he has been \nemployed as an information architect by a government contractor. In October 2001, he \nwas awarded a security clearance. (Item 5; Item 9.) \n \n \nOn April 2, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP. Section 24a on the e-QIP asks \nthe following question: \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is shorter, \nhave you illegally used a controlled substance, for example, marijuana, cocaine, crack \ncocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, \ndepressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, \nPCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d (Item 5; emphasis in original.) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 24a and provided additional information. \nHe stated that he used marijuana illegally approximately 20 times from June 2000 to \nApril 2008. (Item 5 at 37.) \n \n \nOn October 11, 2000, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SF-\n86). Question 27 on the SF-86 asked the following question: Since the age of 16 or in \nthe last 7 years, whichever is shorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, \nfor example, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, \ncodeine, heroin, etc.), amphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone, \ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.), or prescription drugs?\u201d (Item 6 at \n10.) \n \n \nApplicant answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 27 and provided additional information. He \nstated that he used marijuana two times between June 1 and August 15, 1999. (Item 6 \nat 10.) \n  \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant was interviewed about his illegal drug use by an authorized investigator \nfrom the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on June 6, 2008.1 In the \npersonal subject interview, as summarized by the investigator, Applicant stated that he \nbegan to use marijuana in 2000 while he was a college student. He reported that he \ntook approximately five puffs on a marijuana pipe once a semester from June 2000 until \nMay 2003. Applicant told the investigator that he did not use any illegal drugs between \nJune 2003 and July 2006. Then, in July 2006, Applicant was fired from a job and began \nto use marijuana again. He used marijuana approximately once a week while alone in \nhis apartment between July and November 2006. He then stopped using marijuana for \nabout seven months. He began his weekly marijuana use again after he was laid off \nfrom a job in October 2007. Applicant told the investigator that between November 2007 \nand the date of his personal subject interview on June 6, 2008, he took five puffs of \nmarijuana from a pipe once every six months. He claimed that his marijuana use did not \naffect his speech or coordination or impair his judgment or reliability. He told the \ninvestigator that he currently used marijuana when he was bored. (Item 7 at 4.) \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that while his security clearance was \n\u201ctechnically in effect\u201d when he used marijuana, he did not have contact with \u201csensitive \nmaterials at any time while using marijuana.\u201d He also noted: \u201cOne error in this finding is \nthat my involvement with marijuana began around 2003, not in 1999, and it should be \nnoted that it ceased in early 2008 \u2013 creating a nearly two year span to this point without \nthe drug.\u201d (Item 4 at 1.) \n \n \n                       \n \n \n    Policies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthe administrative judge applies these guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in \nthe adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a \nfair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is \n \n1 On May 20, 2008, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant confirmed the accuracy of the \ninformation in the investigator\u2019s report and added the following information: \u201cI have ceased using \nmarijuana since prior to and in the 11 months to date since the interview.\u201d (Item 7 at 2.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \na conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. AG \u00b6 24(a) defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d AG  \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe record shows that Applicant admitted the illegal use of marijuana, with \nvarying frequency, for approximately nine years, from 1999 to at least June 2008. \nAlthough Applicant asserted in his answer that his involvement with marijuana did not \nbegin until 2003, he completed an SF-86 in 2000 and admitted marijuana use in 1999. \nApplicant\u2019s statement of 2003 initial marijuana use lacks credibility and is contradicted \nby his own statements on the SF-86 he completed in 2000. The record also establishes \nthat Applicant used marijuana after being granted a DoD security clearance in October \n2001.   \n \nThe record also establishes that Applicant, who is now 29 years old, used \nmarijuana in his college years. His marijuana use continued even after he graduated from \ncollege in 2003, and after he began his professional career. As recently as 2008, as a 27-\nyear-old adult, he continued to use marijuana. This conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. It also raises security concerns about his ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal \ndrug use raises security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g). AG \u00b6 25(a) reads: \u201cany \ndrug abuse [as defined at AG \u00b6 24(b)].\u201d AG \u00b6 25(g) reads: \u201cany illegal drug use after \nbeing granted a security clearance.\u201d \n \nTwo Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation. If Applicant demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future by disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used, abstaining from drug use for an \nappropriate period, or signing a statement of intent with the automatic revocation of his \nsecurity clearance for any violation, then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be applicable.  \n \nFrom 1999 to 2008, Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use was on-going and frequent. The \nrecord shows that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use continued up to the time he completed his \ne-QIP in April 2008 and was interviewed by an OPM investigator in June 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use was a long-term lifestyle choice. He used marijuana while \nentrusted with a security clearance.  \n \nApplicant provided no information to demonstrate an intent not to abuse drugs in \nthe future. He failed to provide evidence that he had abstained from drug use for an \nappropriate period; that he had disassociated from those with whom he had used drugs \nin the past; or that he had changed his conduct to avoid environments where drugs are \nused. Moreover, he failed to provide a signed statement of intent with an automatic \nrevocation of his security clearance for any future illegal drug use or abuse of \nprescription drugs. Absent evidence of demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future, I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not apply in mitigation to the \nsecurity concerns raised by the facts in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant was candid in \nrevealing his drug abuse when he completed his e-QIP and when he was interviewed \nby an OPM investigator, he failed to demonstrate that he would not return to drug use in \nthe future. In his statement in response to the FORM, he failed to recognize or \nacknowledge that his long-term drug use, some of which occurred while he held a \nsecurity clearance, may have had some deleterious effects on his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability.

Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s conduct raised Personal Conduct Disqualifying\nCondition (PCDC) 16(a),1 which is sustainable in light of Applicant\u2019s repeated false statements.\nHowever, Department Counsel persuasively contends that the Judge erred by not also concluding\nthat the evidence raised PCDC 16(d).2  This paragraph states, among other things, that an applicant\u2019s\nrelease of proprietary information can raise Guideline E security concerns, insofar as such conduct\nevidences untrustworthiness or unreliability.  The Judge\u2019s findings demonstrate that Applicant\nreleased such information to a representative of the Israeli government, in an effort to further his\nown employment interests at a time in which he was considering moving from the United States to\nIsrael.  The Judge erred by not analyzing Applicant\u2019s case in light of PCDC 16(d).\n\n3Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 17(c): \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment[.]\u201d  \n4\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in his application of Personal Conduct\nMitigating Condition (PCMC) 17(c).3  While the Judge noted that a decade had passed since\nApplicant\u2019s last SCA falsification, Department Counsel persuasively argues that the Judge\u2019s\ndiscussion did not properly evaluate this passage of time in light of the entirety of the record\nevidence.  The mere passage of time cannot be viewed in isolation and must be evaluated with\nreference to other facts and circumstances in the case.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-05351 at 7-8\n(App. Bd. Mar. 12, 2010).  In this case, Applicant engaged in security significant conduct by\nproviding proprietary information to a foreign government.  Over a decade later he falsified his SCA\nconcerning this matter and, six years after that, the falsified another SCA.  The Judge\u2019s decision does\nnot reasonably explain why the mere passage of time (even, as here, when it is ten years) is\nsufficient to mitigate multiple instances raising security concerns that occurred over an even longer\nperiod of time.    \nFurthermore, as Department Counsel argues, the decision does not reasonably explain why\nthe conduct in question occurred under unique circumstances or why it was minor.  While it is true\nthat there is no evidence of Applicant\u2019s having compromised other proprietary information, this\nincident and his subsequent falsifications constitute a series of security significant incidents.  The\nevidence does not support a conclusion that the Guideline E concerns arose from unique\ncircumstances.  Rather, they resulted from conscious decisions by Applicant to advance his own\ninterests at the expense of his employer\u2019s legitimate desire for the confidentiality of its work product\nand to keep knowledge of that conduct from the Government.  That such behavior has not occurred\nagain is not due to anything inherent in the underlying circumstances but, rather, in Applicant\u2019s own\nchoices.  Moreover, Applicant\u2019s conduct, considered as a whole, cannot be said to be minor, insofar\nas the Directive itself states that failure to provide truthful answers during the security clearance\nprocess is of \u201cspecial interest\u201d in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security worthiness.  Directive, Enclosure\n2 \u00b6 15.  Finally, Department Counsel persuasively contends that the Judge did not reasonably\naddress the final clause of PCMC 17(c), which requires a showing that the conduct does not cast\ndoubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  Accordingly, we conclude that\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s overarching issue that the Judge erred in his application of the mitigating\nconditions is persuasive.  \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis does not add anything\nnot already contained in his analysis of PCMC 17(c).  This argument has merit, in light of the\nrelatively conclusory nature of the whole-person analysis section of the decision.  Accordingly, the\nwhole-person analysis does not provide an additional basis for the Judge\u2019s favorable findings.  \n\n4We note Government Exhibit 3, an affidavit by Applicant prepared in 2008, in which Applicant discusses\nvarious aspects of his record as it pertains to his security worthiness.  He mentions a polygraph examination in 2001,\nin which he advised about his interaction with the Israeli government.  He states that he passed the exam, which is\nconsistent with the record evidence in his case.  However, he does not mention the prior polygraph in 2000, in which\nhe initially denied having had contact with a foreign government.  The document prepared in 2008 is not consistent with\na conclusion that Applicant has been consistently forthright about his security significant conduct in the years following\nhis 2000 SCA falsification, which further undermines his efforts to demonstrate mitigation under the Egan standard.\n5\nFor all the reasons set forth above, Department Counsel\u2019s argument that the Judge\u2019s decision\ncontains significant errors is persuasive.4  Accordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s favorable\ndecision is not sustainable.  The record, viewed as a whole, will not support a conclusion that\nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion as to mitigation, either through application of the\nmitigating conditions or the whole-person factors.  We note that Applicant was not denied a\nclearance after the 2000 polygraph uncovered his improper release of proprietary information and\nsubsequent falsifications.  However, DOHA \u201cis not estopped from making an adverse clearance\ndecision when there were prior favorable adjudications.\u201d   ISCR Case No. 07-17383 at 2 (App. Bd.\nFeb. 12, 2009). \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Michael Y.

In his RSOR, Applicant\nadmitted that he \u201cgave one document to a liaison from the Israeli Consulate.\u201d  \nAt the hearing Applicant testified that early in 1983 he was planning a trip to\nIsrael, and he was considering the possibility of moving to Israel to reside there. He\ncontacted the Israeli consulate to inquire about employment possibilities, and he\nreceived the named of a technical liaison with whom he spoke on the phone. The liaison\ntold him that he would welcome any information that the Applicant could provide about\nhis work. Applicant testified that he told this man that he would never reveal classified\ninformation, which he never did, but a few weeks later he did provide to the man an\nunclassified proprietary document that described a top level research project in which\nhis employer was engaged. Applicant estimated that the document was 20 to 25 pages,\nand Applicant stated that he did not consider that he was doing anything to harm the\nUnited States, since the document was not classified, and because Israel was a\ncustomer of his employer and a close ally of the United States. (Tr at 37-40.) Applicant\nultimately decided not to move to Israel, and he has had no contact with any Israeli\nrepresentative since 1983. (Tr at 49-50.)\n1.b. Applicant executed a DoD Personnel Security Questionnaire, DD Form 398\non October 10, 1994. (Exhibit 2.) The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts\nin response to question 14. (d) which asks, \u201cHave you ever had any contact with a\nforeign government, its establishments (e.g., embassies, consulates, or its\nrepresentatives) whether inside or outside the U.S. other than on official U.S.\nGovernment business?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. It is alleged in the\nSOR that he should have included the contact with the Israeli consulate in\napproximately 1983, as alleged in subparagraph 1.a., above. Applicant admitted this\nallegation in his RSOR and when he testified. He conceded that he should have\ndisclosed this information on the questionnaire. (Tr at 40.)\n\n3\n1.c. Applicant executed a Security Clearance Application (SCA), Standard Form\n86, on February 18, 2000. (Exhibit 1.) The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material\nfacts in response to question 7.c. which asks, \u201cHave you ever had any contact with a\nforeign government, its establishments (e.g., embassies or consulates) or its\nrepresentatives, whether inside or outside the U.S. other than on official U.S.\nGovernment business?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this question. It is alleged in the\nSOR that he should have included the contact with the Israeli consulate in\napproximately 1983, as alleged in subparagraph 1.a., above. Applicant admitted this\nallegation in his RSOR and when he testified. He also conceded that he should have\ndisclosed this information on the SCA. (Tr at 40.)\nApplicant testified that he was given a polygraph in 2000, and during that test he\nwas asked whether he ever had contact with a representative of a foreign country. He\ninitially denied that he had, but then he admitted that he previously had contact with a\nforeign representative. Applicant stated that his initial denial was because he was\nembarrassed as he had never done anything like this before, and he was not sure how\nit would affect his security clearance. (Tr at 44-45.)\nApplicant testified that following his first polygraph in 2000, he resolved to\nscrupulously comply with all security requirements, and since that time he has. (Tr at\n45.)  In 2001, he was given another polygraph, and this time he revealed all the foreign\ncontact information without reservation. In 2005, when Applicant completed another\nSCA, he revealed his contact with the Israeli Consulate representative.  (Tr at 41-43.)\nExhibit HHH is a copy of the 2005 SCA, which establishes that Applicant  did inform the\nGovernment that he had contact with the Israeli Consulate in 1983. Additionally,\nApplicant revealed his foreign contact during a 2008 OPM interview (Exhibit III), to all of\nthe witnesses who testified at the hearing, and to all of the individuals who provided\naffidavits that have been entered into evidence. (Exhibits A through U.)  \nApplicant averred that during his almost 50 years of holding a security clearance,\nthis was the only situation in which he was less than completely candid with any of his\nemployers or the United States Government. Also during that period, the only other\nincident he could cite in which his security was questioned occurred in 1970, when\nApplicant entered his work space in the morning. He was informed by a security guard,\nwho left a note, informing him that he had failed to secure his safe on the previous night.\n(Tr at 45-46.) \nAt 73 years of age, Applicant stated that he has the financial means to retire, but\nhe still feels that he has a lot to contribute, as he is \u201cvery interested in national defense\nand doing what I can for the country.\u201d (Tr at 47.)\nMitigation\nIn addition to Applicant, six individuals testified on his behalf. They included his\ndirect supervisor, Witness 1, whose resume is Exhibit A, and who also offered an\naffidavit into evidence. (Exhibit B.)  Exhibits RR, SS, and TT are Performance\nAppraisals that she prepared for Applicant. About Applicant she testified, \u201cI trust him\n\n4\nabsolutely 100 percent.\u201d (Tr at 105.) The next witness was Applicant\u2019s former supervisor\nfrom 1996 to 2000, Witness 2, and his resume is Exhibit C. Exhibit D is an affidavit he\nsubmitted. Exhibits OO, PP, and QQ are Performance Appraisals that he prepared for\nApplicant. He described Applicant as a \u201ctop notch\u201d performer with \u201cunswerving integrity\nand attention to detail. (Tr at 123-130.) The third witness had worked in aerospace for\n40 years, Witness 3, who was a corporate senior vice president, when Applicant worked\nfor him.  Exhibit E is his resume and Exhibit F is his affidavit. Witness 3 has known\nApplicant since 1975, and he indicated that he has \u201cnever had the slightest reason to\nquestion his character.\u201d  (Tr at 148.) He also stated that he believed Applicant is\nremorseful for his conduct that is the subject of the SOR. (Tr at 153-154.) \nThe fourth witness is a retired United States Air Force Colonel, now president of\na technology company, Witness 4. Exhibit I is the resume of Witness 4, and Exhibit J is\nhis affidavit. He also submitted three letters. (Exhibits L, M, and N.) Witness 4 indicated\nthat he has complete confidence in Applicant, and he does not believe the conduct that\nis the subject of the SOR will reoccur. (Tr at 172.) The fifth witness is a college\nprofessor, who is Applicant\u2019s next door neighbor, and who described Applicant as a\ngood friend. Exhibit G is the resume and Exhibit H is an affidavit submitted by Witness\n5. This witness testified that Applicant expressed his deep remorse to him, and it was\nclear that such conduct would never occur again. He described him as an \u201cextremely\ntrustworthy and conscientious person.\u201d (Tr at 182-183.) The sixth and final witness is\nthe Cantor from Applicant\u2019s synagogue, who has known Applicant for 20 years.  Exhibit\nS is an affidavit from Witness 6.  This witness testified that he and Applicant have\nbecome friends as Applicant is a member of the choir from their synagogue. He\ndescribed Applicant as someone with exemplary character, who is esteemed and\nrevered at their synagogue. (Tr at 188-191.)\nApplicant also submitted several positive character letters from individuals who\ndid not testify at the hearing.  (Exhibits Q, R, T, and U.) They all wrote in extremely\npositive terms about him. This included a letter from Applicant\u2019s Rabbi, who wrote that it\nwas his fervent belief that Applicant is \u201creliable, trustworthy and a man who exercises\ngood judgement and calm consideration in all things.\u201d (Exhibit U.)\nFinally, Applicant submitted a great number of awards that he has earned,\nexhibiting positive recognition that Applicant has received during his career.  (Exhibits V\nthrough JJ).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\n\n5\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence has established that Applicant\ncommitted conduct that could be considered to involve questionable judgement, lack of\ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, because of\nhis supplying an individual from a foreign Government with a proprietary document, and\nalso for failing to honestly identify this act on Government Security Applications. \n\n6\nThe Government relies heavily on the honesty and integrity of individuals seeking\naccess to our nation\u2019s secrets. If such an individual intentionally falsifies material facts, it\nis extremely difficult to conclude that he nevertheless possesses the judgment, and\nhonesty necessary for an individual given a clearance.\nIn reviewing the disqualifying conditions under Guideline E, I conclude that\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire\u201d that \u00b6 16(a) applies against Applicant. \nI  have also considered that Applicant\u2019s initial transgression occurred in 1983, 27\nyears ago, and the subsequent furnishing of misleading information occurred in 1994\nand 2000, 16 and 10 years ago. Based on Applicant credible testimony at the hearing\nand the very laudatory testimony of the witness that appeared for Applicant, plus his\nsubsequent incidents of being truthful, I find that Applicant is extremely remorseful, and\nit is highly unlikely that any such conduct would ever occur again. I find mitigating\ncondition \u00b6 17(c) can be applied as \u201cso much time has passed\u201d and \u201cit happened under\nsuch unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgement.\u201d  I therefore, resolve\nGuideline E for Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.   \n   \n         I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on all of the reasons cited\nabove as to why the mitigating conditions apply, considered together with the very long\nand successful career of Applicant, and the extremely positive testimony of the\nesteemed witnesses that appeared on Applicant\u2019s behalf,  I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with no significant questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance under the whole-person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. - 1.c.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 2, 2009\nDecision\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn April 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H for\nApplicant (Item 1). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on May 13, 2009 (Item 3).  He\nrequested that his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn June 24, 2009, Department Counsel submitted the Department's written\ncase. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to\nApplicant, and he was given the opportunity to file objections and submit material in\nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. A response was due on July 30, 2009. Applicant\n\n2\ndid not submit any additional evidence. The case was assigned to this Administrative\nJudge on September 9, 2009.\nIn the FORM, Department Counsel offered five documentary exhibits (Items 1-5).\nNo documents were offered by Applicant. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR (Item 3) Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a., through 1.e., and\nhe denied 1.f. The admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including the\nFORM, Applicant's RSOR and the other admitted documents, and upon due\nconsideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 52 years old. He works for a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\n(Guideline H - Drug Involvement) \nThe SOR lists six allegations, 1.a. through 1.f., regarding illegal drug involvement\nunder Adjudicative Guideline H. As stated above, allegations 1.a. through 1.e. were\nadmitted by Applicant in the RSOR. All of the allegations will be discussed in the same\norder as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he used marijuana from\napproximately 1974 to 1992, and again from approximately 2000 to at least July 2008. \nIn the Report of Investigation (ROI), affirmed and adopted by Applicant in his\nResponse to Interrogatories, dated December 16, 2008 (Item 5), it states that  Applicant\nfirst used marijuana when he was 18 in 1974. He thereafter smoked marijuana alone,\ntwo or three times a week, in the amount of four or five grams a week, until 1992, when\nhe was arrested for possession of marijuana (see 1.d., below). He stopped using\nmarijuana from May 1992 until December 2000, when he began using it again because\nof peer pressure. Applicant admitted that since December 2000, he has used marijuana\ntwo or three times a week in the evening or on weekends, and he described being in a\neuphoric state when he was high from smoking marijuana. \n1.b. The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he purchased marijuana\nfrom approximately 1974 to 1992, and again from approximately 2000 to at least July\n2008.\n1.c.  The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he sold marijuana from\napproximately 1974 to 1992.\n\n3\n 1.d. The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that in about June 1992,\nApplicant was arrested and charged with Possession of Marijuana. The charge was\ndismissed following his completion of an accelerated rehabilitation program and\nattendance at a drug and alcohol course (Item 7). \n1.e. The SOR alleges and Applicant has admitted that he has used marijuana\nwhile possessing a security clearance, which was granted to Applicant in December\n1981 (Item 4 at 22). \n1.f.  The SOR alleges that in July 2008, Applicant expressed an intent to continue\nto use marijuana in the future. In his RSOR, Applicant denied this allegation and wrote, \u201c\nI have discontinued using marijuana.\u201d However, in the ROI (Item 5), it states, \nSubject [Applicant] plans to continue to smoke marijuana, but he\nplans to stop using marijuana within five years due to health reasons.\nSubject is aware smoking marijuana is illegal, but subject believes the law\nis unfair due to smoking marijuana should be legal as the effects of\nsmoking marijuana are similar to that of alcohol.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

Applicant's overall conduct pertaining to his illegal substance abuse clearly falls\nwithin Drug Involvement Disqualifying Conditions (DC) 25. (a) \u201cany drug abuse\u201d, (c)\n\u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale,\nor distribution\u201d, and (g) \u201cany illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\u201d\nBased on the totality of admitted evidence, including Applicant\u2019s conflicting statements\nregarding his intention to use marijuana again, I also find that DC 25. (h) \u201cfailure to\nclearly and convincingly commit to discontinue drug use\u201d is applicable. \nBased on the Applicant\u2019s many years and frequency of use of illegal substances,\nand the recency of his usage, considered with the fact that Applicant used marijuana\nwhile possessing a security clearance, I can not conclude at this time that Applicant\u2019s\nconduct comes within any Mitigating Condition (MC). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n5\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuideline H, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Based on\nall of the reasons cited above, including the long history, frequency, and recency of\nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug usage and purchase, including during the period that he held a\nsecurity clearance, I find that the record evidence leaves me with serious doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance under the whole person\nconcept. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a. -1.f.:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 39, single and has a Ph.D. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he falsified material facts to medical authorities and government personnel, both before and during the clearance screening process, concerning his mental health. This paragraph also alleges that Applicant\u2019s program access was revoked by another government agency (AGA) because of the same concerns. Applicant denied paragraph 1.a, and admitted the basic facts set forth in 1.b. He also submitted additional information to support his request for access to classified information. In 1995 Applicant traveled to Indonesia for his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at section 18.) During that trip he was taken ill with a parasitic round worm, Ascaris Lumbricoides. He remained ill for over two years. The round worm passed in December 1997. (Answer at Attachment 2.) In 2008 a doctor connected to Applicant\u2019s then health care provider stated, \u201cIt took him [Applicant] until the end of 2002 to fully recover from this infection.

(Government Exhibit 3.) On January 25, 2011, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 12, 2011, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. (Answer.) Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on April 23, 2012. This case was assigned to me on May 4, 2012. DOHA\n\nSee Tr. 53.\n1\nSee Tr. 65-69.\n2\n2\nissued a notice of hearing on July 9, 2012. I convened the hearing as scheduled on\nAugust 14, 2012. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one\nadditional witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A through J, which were also\nadmitted without objection. Applicant asked that the record remain open for the receipt\nof additional documents. Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted Applicant Exhibits K and L on\nAugust 23, 2012, which were received without objection. DOHA received the transcript\n(Tr.) of the hearing on August 21, 2012. The record closed on August 23, 2012. Based\nupon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 39, single and has a Ph.D. He is employed by a defense contractor\nand seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he falsified material facts to medical authorities and government\npersonnel, both before and during the clearance screening process, concerning his\nmental health. This paragraph also alleges that Applicant\u2019s program access was\nrevoked by another government agency (AGA) because of the same concerns.\nApplicant denied paragraph 1.a, and admitted the basic facts set forth in 1.b. He also\nsubmitted additional information to support his request for access to classified\ninformation.\nIn 1995 Applicant traveled to Indonesia for his employment. (Government Exhibit\n1 at section 18.) During that trip he was taken ill with a parasitic round worm, Ascaris\nLumbricoides. He remained ill for over two years. The round worm passed in December\n1997. (Answer at Attachment 2.) In 2008 a doctor connected to Applicant\u2019s then health\ncare provider stated, \u201cIt took him [Applicant] until the end of 2002 to fully recover from\nthis infection. During the period of 1995 through 2002 he had severe diarrhea, lost\nconsiderable weigh and was malnourished.\u201d (Answer at Attachment 4, page 6.)\nApplicant left this employment in October 1997, before the date when the worm\npassed. He returned to employment in February 1998. Applicant stated, \u201cI stopped\nworking because I was weak basically and I did have some of these visual effects that\nare described in the record.\u201d (Tr. 38.)  He went on to describe the visual effects as\n1\nfollows, \u201cTypically they were faces, typically they were vague and had a day dreaming\ntype of quality to them.\u201d (Tr. 39.)  Applicant also stated, \u201cI didn\u2019t have any mental health\n2\n\nThe psychiatrist\u2019s curriculum vitae is Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K.\n3\n3\nproblems. I didn\u2019t have any mental health problems throughout. What I had mentioned\nwere the visual imagery, the words coming into my head.\u201d (Tr. 50.)\nApplicant was evaluated by a psychiatrist (Doctor A) in June 2012.  The\n3\npsychiatrist described Applicant\u2019s status as follows:\nBetween October and December 1997 he [Applicant] developed\npeculiar mental status symptoms. During this time he describes seeing\nwell-formed visual images of faces of people he had met either\nprofessionally or socially, as well as some specific objects such as an\navocado. He also reports that on occasion, specific words would come to\nmind for no particular reason. [Applicant] reports that these symptoms\nwould seem like \u201cdaydreams\u201d rather than hallucinations. These symptoms\nwere troublesome to him but were not associated with any delusions or\nother distortions of reality. [Applicant] sought medical treatment for these\npeculiar mental status findings and his gastrointestinal symptoms in 1997.\nHis ascariasis was diagnosed and treated, and once treated his peculiar\nmental status symptoms seemed to end. Over the next several years he\ndeveloped worsening gastrointestinal symptoms and during mid-1999\nthrough 2002 his peculiar mental status symptoms reappeared, but to a\nlesser degree than before. By 2002 both [Applicant\u2019s] undiagnosed\nmacrocytic anemia, suggestive of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency\nsecondary to intestinal malabsorption, and his peculiar mental status\nsymptoms were resolved. While suffering through intense gastrointestinal\nsymptoms and sporadic peculiar mental status symptoms he remained\nfully functional in his professional and personal life. The symptoms have\nnot recurred since 2002. (Applicant Exhibit A at 1.)\nApplicant described the incidents during this period in a vastly different way to a\npsychiatrist (Doctor B) and hypnotherapist (Doctor C) in 2002, as further described\nbelow. \n1.a.(i). March 4, 1999. Applicant saw his personal physician about stomach/gas\npain. Discusses the round worm infection. No mention is made of any hallucinations or\nother mental health topics. (Answer at Attachment 1; Tr. 49-51.)\n1.a.(ii). Applicant was interviewed by AGA on March 21, 2000. He stated to an\ninvestigator, \u201cHis [Applicant\u2019s] employment with [company] ended in 10/97 when he\nvoluntarily resigned because of his unusual illness. . . . He felt that it would be in his\nbest interest to take time off during his period of recuperation from 10/2/97 to 2/25/98.\u201d\n(Government Exhibit 5 at 101; Tr. 52-53.)\nIn approximately September 2000 Applicant invested approximately $200,000\nwith people he met at dance class. This couple stated to Applicant that they would buy\ncut rate designer fashions for a low price, sell them at a higher price, and both they and\n\n4http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra (last modified Nov. 5, 2012).\n4\nApplicant would make money. (Tr. 44-48.) In his testimony, the transaction is described\nas a normal business transaction, though Applicant stated, \u201cNow this investment was an\ninvestment that was not something I normally would have invested in. . . . So I attribute\nthe illness to contributing to my investing in that clothing business because it was\nunusual for me to invest in that.\u201d (Tr. 48.) This transaction is further described below.\n1.a.(iii). Beginning on February 11, 2002, and going through October 2, 2002,\nApplicant saw Doctor B, a psychiatrist. The doctor\u2019s hand-written notes are somewhat\ndifficult to read, but they describe Applicant\u2019s history of auditory and visual\nhallucinations, including controlling hallucinations in connection with the investment he\nmade, discussed above. Applicant stated to Doctor B these visual and auditory\nhallucinations occurred primarily in 1997, but also in 1999. As of 2002 Applicant stated\nhe was no longer experiencing auditory hallucinations and visual hallucinations were\ninfrequent. (Government Exhibit 4 at 7-10, 15-23; Tr. 53-59.)\nApplicant also provided Doctor B with a written statement of his history in\nSeptember 2002. (Tr. 96-97; Answer at 3.) This extensive statement is found in\nGovernment Exhibit 4 at 171-189. \nThe statement starts by describing how, beginning in September 1997, Applicant\nbegan attending seminars on a form of philosophy called Chakra  run by Mr. S. He had\n4\nseveral meetings with Mr. S during that September. After the last:\nI went to the . . . farmer\u2019s market, and began to have my first of many daily\nhallucinations that would occur for the next 4 years, with the exception of a\n1 year 7 month period. As I was picking up apples, my hands seemed to\nbe moving faster than possible, and the farmer selling them said, look at\nthose hands with a look of amazement. (Id. at 172.)\nOn October 1, 1997, while meeting with his brother, who worked for the same\ncompany:\nMy brother entered and passed gas. I saw the gas as a shiny solid sphere\nmoving toward me, entering my body through my right hand moving in my\narm very quickly (I could both see and feel it in my arm) going through my\nshoulder and lodging in my heart causing a sharp pain in the center of my\nchest. I left his office terrified of what I had seen. Later on that day, I sat in\nthe stairwell near my office to eat lunch and heard a howling sound\ncoming from deep within my gut progressing to my head and seeming to\ncause tears to come out of my eyes. I thought this was the blocked energy\nleaving my root Chakra. [Mr. S] had said that the negative energy could\nturn to positive energy by rising and turning into tears. After the 2\nhallucinations that I viewed as real events at the time, I decided that my\nbrother had blocked my heart and I had to leave, I asked my supervisor to\nallow me to leave without the formality of a two-week notice, because my\n\nCity One is located south of Applicant\u2019s then home and place of employment.\n5\n5\nlife was in danger. She asked me where I was going; I told her The\nHealing Center in [City One], and then escorted me out. That evening I\ncalled my landlord, asking if I could leave my apartment without the\nformality of a two-week notice, he agreed. I called [Mr. S] and tried to\narrange to meet him that day, he said he could not; he had to go to [City\nTwo], and said I\u2019ll see you there. The next day I threw out all my\nbelongings away [sic], and arranged to give the rest away to Salvation\nArmy the following day. All day long I had auditory hallucinations of\nneighbors shouting profanities (at the time I did not recognize them as\nprofanities) in a violent tone adding to my terror. I made an appointment to\ngo to The Healing Center in [City One], though I canceled it, because\ncontrolling hallucinations convinced me to go north. After finding out that I\nwas missing, my family\u2019s search effort would focus on [City One].  (Id. at\n5\n172-173.) (Emphasis supplied.) \nApplicant then started bicycling his way to his sister\u2019s house in the northern part\nof his state. In all he cycled approximately 400 miles. \u201cOn the way I had many visual\nhallucinations, which indicated the path I should take.\u201d (Id. at 173.) Applicant several\nweeks later would take a bus back to his home city to meet again with  Mr. S. For the\nnext two months, according to Applicant\u2019s account, he experienced \u201cmore complex\ncontrolling visual and auditory hallucinations.\u201d (Id. at 174.)\nAs stated earlier, the worm passed on December 24, 1997. The hallucinations\nstopped around this time and Applicant stated, \u201cI attributed the hallucinations to the\nworm infection, though after exhaustive research on the subject could not find a\nconnection between Ascaris Lumbricoides and psychosis.\u201d (Id. at 175.)\nApplicant returned to employment in February 1998. He states that things were\n\u201cnormal again until July of 1999.\u201d Then, after attending a seminar on a form of healing\nthrough touch:\nI slowly began experiencing the return of involuntary movement,\ncontrolling auditory, visual, olfactory, and pain hallucinations which were\nmuch more sophisticated, intense, and thorough than previously that\nlasted until now, occurring throughout day and night and maintaining\ncontinuous control. Again I became terrified of people and my\nenvironment. This second occurrence of psychosis lasted 1 year and 4\nmonths at an intense level, and continues at a background level to this\nday [2002]. (Id.)\nApplicant then went through what he described as \u201cclasses of controlling\nhallucinations,\u201d giving extensive examples in areas such as Food, Sleep, Exercise,\nVegan. In the area of \u201cFood,\u201d for example, he states, among other things, \u201cControlling\nHallucinations told me I needed to do headstands every time I ate fruit, which I did but\neventually found to be impractical.\u201d (Id. at 178.)\n\nIn his testimony, Applicant would describe Mr. S as a \u201cyoga instructor\u201d and does not talk about Chakra or\n6\nwhat he describes in his statements to the medical professionals as the control Mr. S\u2019s \u201cimage\u201d had over his\nlife for a long period of time. Rather, he states that Mr. S may have hypnotized him. (Tr. 59-62.)\n6\nHe had an entry for \u201cControlling Hallucinations,\u201d which included Images, Sound\nand Talking. The predominant figure in the Images was Mr. S. Regarding Talking:\nIn conversations, I constantly would use words that appeared in my mind\nspontaneously as if a voice were whispering them to me along with the\ncommand \u201csay . . . \u201c. For example \u201csay you\u2019re good\u201d would appear in my\nmind and I would say to the person I was conversing with me [sic] \u201cyou\u2019re\ngood\u201d. This sentence was used the most. Controlling thought explained to\nme that the words were exactly what the person wanted to hear through\nthe hallucinatory voice of [Mr. S].  (Id. at 182.)\n6\nUnder the entry \u201cDancing\u201d Applicant described his involvement with a dance club\nin 2000. Applicant stated, \u201cI experienced many hallucinations in the dance place.\nHallucinatory voices in my mind made it sound very pleasant, but ultimately it would be\nthe single most damaging environment to my life during my psychosis.\u201d He goes on to\ndescribe the influence of hallucinations of Mr. S, who appeared constantly at the dance\nhall. (Id. at 183.)\nApplicant\u2019s statement then goes on to discuss in great detail several people who\nhe calls \u201cManipulators.\u201d First of all, he discusses the couple who he eventually wound\nup suing for $200,000. Applicant states \u201cinvoluntary motion of my legs accompanied by\nimages of [Mr. S] would take me across the dance floor toward a seated couple, it was\nuncomfortable, specially since I did not want to be near them. I obeyed.\u201d (Id. at 184.) He\ndescribes this couple telling him about their business. Eventually, \u201cControlling\nhallucinations ordered me to invest with her, which I did and began receiving 100%\nreturn on my investment. I was very reluctant to invest with her, but controlling\nhallucinations near continuously told me that \u2018this is your big Agebat\u2019, a Farsi word for\ndestiny, and I gave her a check.\u201d (Id. at 185.) His statement discusses his financial\ndealings with this couple, which he states were \u201cordered by controlling hallucinations.\u201d\nAccording to the statement, Applicant sold all of his personal investments in mutual\nfunds, as well as applying for credit cards for the interest of this couple. This conduct\nbegan in approximately September 2000 and went on until approximately October 2001.\nThe statement goes on to discuss Applicant\u2019s involvement with two other people\nwho also bilked him for various amounts of money. As before, his conduct was brought\nabout because of the \u201ccontrolling hallucinations.\u201d (Id. at 187-189.)\nThe final part of this statement is entitled \u201cViolence.\u201d He states, in part:\nFrom June 2000 until September 2001 after returning to my office from\ndancing at . . . Hotel at 1:00 am, nearly most nights I would get angry\nhitting my head against my computer monitor, one night pushing the\nmonitor on the ground (fortunately it did not break). . . . On a daily basis\n\nAmerican Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 532-533 (Fourth\n7\nEdition, Text Revision, APA 2000).\n7\ncontrolling hallucinations would make me angry and sometimes controlling\ninvoluntary movements would slam both hands simultaneously against the\nsides of my head. (Id. at 189.)\n1.a.(iv). March 25, 2002. Applicant filed a complaint in court alleging contractual\nfraud concerning the $200,000 Applicant invested, beginning in 2000, with the couple he\nmet dancing. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit L.)\n1.a.(v). On April 11, 2002, and June 14, 2002, Applicant saw Doctor C, who was\na hypnotherapist. (Tr. 59-61.)\nThe doctor\u2019s Clinic Progress Record for April 11, 2002 states:\nPt [Applicant] has had 2 episodes of visual & auditory hallucinations\nof spontaneous [illegible].\n1  Episode Oct 3 \u201897 \u2013 During Chackra [sic] therapy \u2013 was given\nst\ninstructions on imagery & pt had visual auditory & olfactory hallucinations.\nAlso had involuntary movements of legs after 2  session [with] instructor.\nnd\nThereafter pt had spontaneous visions & hallucinations relating to brother.\nPt made out of character decisions, leaving job, moving etc. These\nhallucinations continued for 3 months & pt continued to visit instructor\nPRN.\n2  Episode 1999 July while at \u201craw foods class\u201d pt responded to\nnd\ninstructor who \u201cenergized his body\u201d & his hands \u201clevitated.\u201d Hallucinations\ncontinued for 2 yrs! He visualized his original instructor [Mr. S]. \u201cI heard his\nvoice\u201d & he directed pts life [for] two years.\nAt the end of the session, Doctor C entered a tentative diagnosis of Dissociative\nDisorder, Not Otherwise Specified (300.15).  (Government Exhibit 4 at 13-14.)\n7\n(Emphasis in original.)\nDoctor C saw Applicant again on June 14, 2002. His progress notes are as\nfollows:\nPt brought in detailed description in single spaced typed 5 page\nreport of his previous experiences [with Mr. S] & the Chakcra [sic] therapy.\nWants me to review it later for my edification.\nPt recognizes that his previous experiences were either \u201cpsychotic\nstates\u201d or mind control based on his hypnotizability. Pt currently better\ntuned to himself, very careful & deliberate in living his life to prevent\n\u201cenvironmental suggestions\u201d.\n\n8\nDiscussed internal cures & internal alarm system \u2013 pt relates.\nPt want to investigate under hypnosis what [Mr. S] did to his mind. I refused!\nPt thanked me & left session. (Id. at 95-96.)\n1.a.(vi.) Applicant\u2019s statement to Dr. C is found in Government Exhibit 4 at 164-\n168. For the most part it mirrors the statement he gave Dr. B, through the time he\nreturned to work in February 1999. The statement ends with a discussion of his\ninvestment with the people from the dance club, where he states:\nI ended up investing $250,000 with a couple who had a small business\nand were seeking investors. I was told by the controlling hallucinations\n[and] presented words to say to them (and everybody I spoke to) telling\nme that I was saying exact words they wanted to hear when I spoke with\nthem. I was told that they would be successful. After leasing them a\nMercedes Benz, taking out a loan on my 401K and a number of credit\ncard, and their continual insistence on having more money and never\nreturning the original investment, I began to ignore the controlling\nhallucinations, and they began to reduce. They still continue in the\nbackground of my mind and I have become disciplined in ignoring them.\nThroughout the majority of the controlling internal visual and auditory\nhallucinations were of [Mr. S]. (Id. at 168.)\nOn April 11, 2003, Applicant won his lawsuit and is awarded $226,774. The\nJudge said in \u201cAmended Judgment After Trial By Court,\u201d prepared by Applicant\u2019s\nlawyer, \u201cAt the time of the initial discussion regarding the investment, Plaintiff [Applicant]\nwas suffering from a medical condition that apparently made him vulnerable to sharp\npractices.\u201d The \u201cJudgment\u201d also states, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until Plaintiff ran out of money and\nreceived medical attention for his psychological condition, that he realized he had been\ndeceived by Defendants.\u201d He was awarded $226,774. (Id. at 193-196.) On November\n20, 2005, Applicant prepared a document entitled, \u201cSecond Addendum to Final Report\u201d\nconcerning this law suit. In this statement he says that the references to a medical\ncondition in the judgment \u201cwas not and is not a diagnosis of a medical professional,\u201d\nbeing based solely on his testimony. (Id. at 185-187.)\n1.a.(vii). On January 31, 2005, Applicant made a statement to an investigator for\nAGA. Applicant confirmed that he made statements to Doctors B and C \u201cfor intermittent\nperceptual problems related to hearing voices of other people telling him to do things or\nsay things that were inconsistent with his personality.\u201d He went on to say that he had\nexperienced \u201cthought insertions.\u201d The report goes on, \u201cThese \u2018thought insertions\u2019\nconsisted of saying things to a couple that he met at a dance club indicating that he was\nreceptive to their ideas. This couple ultimately bilked SUBJECT out of thousands of\ndollars by talking him into investing in their business. SUBJECT believed that voices of\nunknown men made him agree to invest with this couple.\u201d (Id. at 46-48; Tr. 62-65.)\n\n9\n1.a.(viii). On July 13, 2005, Applicant made another statement to an investigator\nfor AGA. \u201cInitially in the interview, SUBJECT maintained that all of the perception\nproblems he discussed in the document he provided his psychiatrist [Doctor B]\nhappened as he described.\u201d The report goes on to state:\nDuring the interview, SUBJECT stated some of the information in\nthe documents he provided the psychiatrist were not true. When asked if\nhe falsified any of the information SUBJECT stated no. He advised he now\nrealizes some of the incidents he reported as hallucinations probably were\ninnocent events he misinterpreted. He used the example of seeing people\nsmiling at him or speaking to him that he reported as hallucinations.\nSUBJECT stated it was probable these events did occur but because of\nhis mental state he associated them with the hallucinations. SUBJECT\ncontinued to deny falsifying any information he provided to the psychiatrist\nor any other physician or mental health professional. SUBJECT denied\ncreating the mental health issues to assist with his lawsuit. (Government\nExhibit 5 at 38-41.)\nApplicant testified that he never had the belief that a person was putting a\nthought into his mind. He went on to say that most of his visions were like daydreams.\n(Tr. 66-68.) \n1.a.(ix.) On January 31, 2006, AGA began the process of denying Applicant\u2019s\nprogram access. A document entitled \u201cSupplemental Statement of [Applicant]\u201d dated\nMarch 14, 2006, and submitted by his attorney to AGA, does not contain any reference\nto controlling hallucinations or the year 1997. (Answer at Enclosure 3; Tr. 69.)\nHowever, Government Exhibit 5 at 117-119 contains an undated and unsigned\n\u201cReply to Letter Revoking Program Access.\u201d This appears to have been prepared by\nApplicant and submitted by his counsel to the psychologist whose report will be\ndiscussed immediately below. \u201cThe \u2018controlling hallucinations\u2019 that the letter mentions\noccured [sic] while I had Ascariasis and ended with treatment of the Ascariasis in 1997.\u201d\n(Id. at 117.) Based on the state of the record, I cannot say with any certainty that this\ndocument was presented to AGA. \nIn February and March 2006 he was interviewed by a psychologist retained by\nApplicant\u2019s then lawyer. Progress notes are hard to read, but they appear to discuss in\ngeneral detail the events of 1997 through 1999. (Id. at 31-41.) At one point Applicant\nstates, \u201cI wasn\u2019t making clear distinctions between what were hallucinations and what\nwere not.\u201d (Id. at 34.) The psychologist\u2019s report of March 14, 2006, does not provide any\nrelevant or material information for this Decision. (Id. at 65-66.)\nApplicant was examined by a clinical psychologist in June 2010. This was at the\nrequest of DOHA. The doctor\u2019s report is Government Exhibit 7. In part the report says:\nThe applicant does not have an emotional, mental or personality condition\nthat could impair his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. He probably\n\n10\nhad a psychotic episode triggered by the Ascaris Lumbricoides which he\nbelieves he first contracted in 1995 in Indonesia, and first noticed in 1997.\nThe symptoms discontinued permanently in 2002. There is no evidence\nthat he was ever prescribed a course of mental healthy treatment. The\nmedical cure for this parasitic infection was the apparent mental health\ncure as well.\n1.a.(x). Another psychiatrist (Doctor D), examined Applicant on June 8, 2008.\nApplicant denied suffering any psychiatric symptoms since 2002. (Tr. 69-70.) In his\nreport Doctor D stated:\nAlso, during this time [1995 through 2002] he experienced some\nunusual symptoms: having images of food in his mind and vague images\nof faces in his mind. These were most likely caused by his physically\ncompromised condition. In fact he went to be evaluated by a psychiatrist\nwho felt [Applicant] did not have a psychiatric condition, but that these\nsymptoms were caused by his physical illness. (Government Exhibit 4 at\n3-6.)\nFinally, as stated above, Applicant was evaluated by Doctor A in 2012. This\ndoctor wrote, \u201cIn my professional opinion, [Applicant] does not suffer from any major\nmental illness of any kind.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit A at 2.)\n1.b. Applicant admitted that AGA revoked his program access in January 2006.\nHe further admits that the revocation was upheld on appeal in October 2006 and\nsecond level review in July 2007. (Government Exhibit 5; Tr. 70-72.)\nMitigation\nApplicant is a highly successful and respected employee. (Applicant Exhibits D,\nE.) Applicant received a patent in 2010 for work he did with his employer in 2003 and\n2004. (Applicant Exhibit I.) Two of Applicant\u2019s supervisors wrote letters on his behalf for\nthis proceeding. One manager, who has worked with Applicant for three years, states,\n\u201cHe possesses a fundamental honesty that invites all to participate in defining a clear\npath of expectation.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit F.) Another supervisor, who has worked with\nApplicant for five years, said, \u201cThroughout this time [Applicant] has represented himself\nand his work with utmost integrity.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit H.)\nIn addition, several coworkers and friends also wrote letters on his behalf during\nthe revocation proceeding before the AGA in 2006. Those letters were also very\nlaudatory. (Government Exhibit 5 at 167-173,184.)\nApplicant is also a valued and vital friend. His witness has known Applicant since\nthey were at college together. She has a PhD, though she currently works in the media\nindustry. She states, \u201cI would trust [Applicant] with my life. In fact there\u2019s nobody I would\ntrust more with anything important to do. He\u2019s a man of tremendous integrity. . . . He\u2019s\n\nSee Tr. 115-118; Applicant Exhibit G.\n8\n11\nvery difficult to corrupt. He\u2019s the best person and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been his friend for 25\nyears.\u201d (Tr. 111-112.)8\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common\nsense, as well as knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\n\n12\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms\nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)\nThe security concerns relating to Personal Conduct are set out in AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty or\nunwillingness to comply with rules or regulations can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid\nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure to\ncooperate with the security clearance process\nApplicant\u2019s conduct in falsifying information either to his own medical doctors, or\nto various entities of DoD, brings into play the following disqualifying conditions under\nAG \u00b6 16: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline,\nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard\nprotected information.\nWhat is beyond dispute is that Applicant did have a round worm infestation for a\nconsiderable period of time, and that it did affect him for years. Unfortunately for\nApplicant, that is all we can be sure about. Applicant at various times has presented at\nleast two equally plausible explanations for his conduct during and after the time of his\nround worm infestation. On the one hand, there is the Applicant who presented\nextensive written statements to his doctors, describing a years-long battle with what he\ndescribed as \u201ccontrolling hallucinations.\u201d This included the hallucinations that basically\nforced him to invest $200,000 in a get-rich-quick scheme in 2000. His conduct in 1997\n\n13\nwhen he stated he quit his job, left his apartment, abandoned his furniture and\nproceeded to bicycle almost 400 miles to his sister\u2019s home, without word to anyone, can\nonly be called bizarre. Department Counsel argued that Applicant made these\nstatements to his doctors in 2002 in order to falsely influence the law suit he filed at the\nsame time to recoup his money. That is also a plausible explanation of his conduct, and\none he did not effectively rebut.\nThen there is the Applicant who, while not disavowing these statements, basically\nacts as if they don\u2019t exist. Instead of describing the exact conduct he engaged in when\nhe left his employment, at the hearing Applicant merely stated, \u201cI stopped working\nbecause I was weak basically and I did have some of these visual effects that are\ndescribed in the record.\u201d (Tr. 38.) While not a lie, his testimony certainly did not explain\nor try to mitigate the evidence of his own prior statements, statements he knew were in\nthe possession of the Government, and were exhibits in his case. He also understated\nthis situation during an interview with AGA in March 2000, stating that he decided to\nleave his work because of his \u201cunusual illness.\u201d\nThe possible explanations for Applicant\u2019s conduct are also mutually exclusive.\nAnd, no matter which one is true, each is equally damning. The basic fact is that he\neither lied to his doctors in 2002 when he described in great detail these incidents, or he\nis lying to us today, by giving those incidents a more reasoned interpretation. It is\nimpossible to reconcile the two stories, and it is the Applicant\u2019s burden to do so. His\nconduct shows extremely questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability and\nlack of candor.\nAG \u00b6 17 (d) says it can be mitigating where, \u201cthe individual has acknowledged\nthe behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or taken other positive\nsteps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy,\nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\nApplicant did not present sufficient evidence to show that he truly understands the\ngravity of his conduct, or the importance of personal integrity in the security clearance\nprocess. This mitigating condition does not have application in this case. There is\ninsufficient evidence that Applicant currently shows consistent good judgment or is\nreliable. \nApplicant is an able and talented man. He is extremely intelligent. Something\nhappened in the period from 1997 through 2002, which he has yet to adequately\nexplain. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\n\n14\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The discussion under\nGuideline E, above, applies here as well. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3), his conduct is recent. I\ncannot find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6).\nAccordingly, I also cannot find that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); or that there is no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6\n2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal\nconduct. Accordingly, the evidence supports denying his request for a security\nclearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Michael D. Segler, Esquire \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  \n(e-QIP) on March 18, 2008. On April 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 15, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on June 5, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on that same date. On June 18, 2009, a Notice of \nHearing was issued, scheduling the hearing for July 14, 2009. The case was heard on \nthat date. The Government offered five exhibits which were admitted as Government \nExhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 5. The Applicant testified and offered 14 exhibits which were admitted \nwithout objection as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A - N. The record was held open until July \nAugust 19, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n28, 2009, to allow Applicant to submit additional documents.  She timely submitted a \nfive-page document that was admitted as AE O. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AE \nO is marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The transcript was received on July 30, 2009.  \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admits all of the SOR allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old systems engineer with a Department of Defense \ncontractor seeking to maintain her security clearance. She has been employed with her \ncompany since January 1998. Her highest level of education is a master\u2019s degree in \napplied computer science. She has worked for various defense contractors during her \ncareer and has held a security clearance since 1980. She is married and has three adult \nchildren and three adult stepchildren. (Tr at 72, 100; Gov 1)  \n \nOn March 18, 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP as part of a periodic \nreinvestigation to maintain her security clearance. She listed that she was behind on a \nfirst and second mortgage on a home that she previously lived in. She and her husband \nwere in the process of negotiating a short sale. (Gov 1, section 28(b)) The short sale \nwas unsuccessful. On September 22, 2008, the home went to foreclosure. The two \nallegations in the SOR involve a $90,734 debt owed to the mortgage company that held \na second mortgage on the property (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and a $340,000 debt owed to the \nmortgage company that held the first mortgage on the property. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) \n \nApplicant married her current husband while both were working for a defense \ncontractor in the southeastern part of the United States. They married in December \n2004. Applicant\u2019s husband owned a home in the area. After their marriage, he added \nApplicant\u2019s name to the deed. Only his name is on the mortgage. Applicant\u2019s daughter \nand future husband lived with Applicant and her husband.  The project that Applicant \nand her husband were working on terminated after 11 months. They were both \ntransferred to a location in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States. They moved in \nlate April 2005. (Tr at 15-19) \n \nWhen they moved, they did not put the house on the market. Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter and her husband continued to live in the house. They could not afford to pay \nthe full mortgage payment. Applicant and her husband agreed to let them pay $650 a \nmonth towards the mortgage. The mortgage payment was $1,588. Applicant and her \nhusband would pay the remainder. The plan was for Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-\nlaw to eventually buy the house. Applicant\u2019s son-in-law claimed that he had a lawsuit \npending and would receive some money. They would then be able to buy the house. (Tr \nat 20) \n \nFrom May 2005 to August 2006, Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law paid no \nrent. Applicant and her husband initially did not push the issue because Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndaughter had just had a baby. (Tr at 26) Applicant and her husband eventually put the \nhouse up for sale, but Applicant\u2019s son-in-law refused to let the real estate agent in the \nhouse or allow people to look at the house. Applicant\u2019s son-in-law and her daughter \nrefused to move out of the home. On August 16, 2006, Applicant and her husband filed \neviction proceedings against her daughter and son-in-law. (AE A) Their son-in-law \ncountersued. Applicant and her husband hired an attorney. A court date was scheduled \nfor April 3, 2007. Applicant and her husband appeared in court with witnesses. \nApplicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law did not appear. Instead, they moved out of the \nhome to another state. Prior to moving out, they caused significant damage to the \nhome. On April 3, 2007, a judgment was awarded to Applicant and her husband in the \namount of $36,563 against her daughter and son-in-law. (AE B) They doubt that they \nwill receive money as a result of the judgment.  They repaired the home and put it up for \nsale. The home sold in November 2008.  Applicant and her husband paid the mortgage \npayments from May 2005 to November 2008. They paid the utilities from April 2007 to \nNovember 2008, after Applicant\u2019s daughter and her husband moved out. They spent \napproximately $67,000 to maintain the property from May 2005 to November 2008. (Tr \nat 20 \u2013 36)  \n \nAfter transferring to their new job location, Applicant and her husband purchased \na new home in June 2005.  The house cost $439,000. The first mortgage was for 80%  \nof the purchase. The second mortgage was for 20% of the purchase price. The house \npayment on the new home was approximately $4,000 a month. Applicant and her \nhusband were able to pay the mortgage payments on both homes with their combined \nincomes. (Tr at 19, 31) \n \nThe situation involving Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law caused a lot of \nstress. Applicant believed that she could deal with the situation better if she lived closer \nto where their former residence was located. She also did not like the area and the \nweather of her new job location. Applicant started to look for another job and eventually \nfound one. In October 2006, she moved back to the southeastern part of the United \nStates and accepted a job with another defense contractor. Her husband planned to \nstay behind until their new home sold or until he found a job in the area near Applicant\u2019s \nnew job.  He soon found a new job and moved in November 2006. (Tr at 36-37; Gov 2 \nat 3) \n \nIn October 2006, the house with the 80/20 mortgage was listed for sale. They did \nnot receive sufficient offers on the home to cover both mortgages on the home.  In June \n2007, Applicant and her husband purchased a home near their new location. The \nmortgage payment was $2,500.  They paid the mortgages on three homes totaling \napproximately $8,000 for one month until Applicant lost her job in July 2007. Applicant\u2019s \nsalary at the time she was laid off was $117,000 a year. She was unemployed for \napproximately seven months. She and her husband could not pay all three mortgages \non his salary alone. After several attempts at a short sale, the home with the 80/20 \nmortgage went to foreclosure in September 2008. (Tr at 37 \u2013 43, 81)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn February 11, 2009, Applicant and her husband\u2019s foreclosed home sold at a \nsheriff\u2019s sale. (AE F) Applicant and her husband were never contacted about a \ndeficiency judgment after the sale. Local law requires that an action for deficiency shall \nbe commenced within three months from the date of the sale. (AE O at 4) Applicant and \nher husband are not aware of the existence of any deficiency judgment. Applicant \nrecalls that her real estate attorney told her that the obligation had been satisfied \nbecause the first mortgagor received the deed to the house. She does not believe she \nowes any more money on the first mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Tr at 84-85) \n \nFor the second mortgage (SOR \u00b6 1.a), Applicant understands that references to \nthe second mortgagor were deleted from the judgment, which means that she and her \nhusband do not have a legal obligation towards the second mortgage.  She is still \ncontacting the second mortgagor to inquire about a possible settlement. On July 9, \n2009, she offered a $10,000 settlement on the $90,000 mortgage. She intends to work \nwith the second mortgage company if this settlement offer is not accepted. (Tr at 86-87; \nAE K) \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $5,146. (AE I; AE J) Her \nhusband\u2019s net monthly income is approximately $5,190. He retired from the United \nStates Navy as a lieutenant commander and receives approximately $2,083 in military \nretirement. (AE L at 4). Their total net monthly income is $12,419.  Their total monthly \nexpenses are approximately $7,246. Their total income left over after expenses are \n$5,173. (Tr at 91; AE L)  \n \nBefore their recent home foreclosure, Applicant and her husband had no \nproblems with credit.  They are current on their taxes. They regularly check their credit \nreports for any discrepancies. They have never had systemic financial problems. They \nhave never filed for bankruptcy. They are current on their other financial obligations. (Tr \nat 92, 96-99; AE M; AE N)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); and FC DC &19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. Applicant was unable to pay the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmortgage payments on one of her three homes which ultimately led to foreclosure. The \nhome has a first mortgage in the approximate amount of $340,000 and a second \nmortgage in the amount of $90,734.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15) An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005))  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. The \nmortgage foreclosure happened within the past year. Although claims were made during \nthe hearing that Applicant and her husband owe nothing further on the first and second \nmortgages on the foreclosed home, nothing was presented from both mortgage \ncompanies indicating that they have no further issues with Applicant and her husband.  \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies in part. Applicant\u2019s and her \nhusband\u2019s financial situation was complicated as a result of her daughter\u2019s and son-in-\nlaw\u2019s failure to follow through with the terms of their rental agreement. However, \nApplicant\u2019s decision to quit her job and move back to the southeastern part of the United \nStates was out of choice rather than necessity. The decision to purchase a third home \nat their new location while still responsible for two mortgages demonstrated poor \njudgment. However, Applicant\u2019s seven-month period of unemployment resulted in \nApplicant and her husband being unable to pay all of the mortgages. A downturn in the \nreal estate market adversely affected their ability to sell the house with the 80/20 \nmortgage. Attempts at a short sale were unsuccessful. Applicant and her husband took \nsteps to prevent the foreclosure. Their mortgage problems were partially caused by \ncircumstances beyond their control. However, FC MC \u00b6 20(b) is given less weight \nbecause it was within Applicant\u2019s control to delay purchasing a third home until the \nissues with the other two mortgages were resolved.   \n \nFC MC \u00b620(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply with regard to counseling. However, Applicant\u2019s financial issues \nare being resolved. Applicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law moved out of their home. They \nsold that home in November 2008. The second home was foreclosed and sold at \nauction in February 2009. Applicant and her husband both work full time. Aside from the \nmortgage issue, they have had no other financial issues. The problem appears to be \nunder control.    \n\n \n7 \n \n \nFC MC &20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies because Applicant and her husband \nattempted to sell the home as a short sale before the foreclosure. They hired a real \nestate attorney. They made a good-faith effort to prevent the home from going to \nforeclosure.  \n \nApplicant and her husband encountered financial trouble when they were unable \nto make the mortgage payments on their three homes after Applicant lost her job and \nwas unemployed for seven months. They would have been able to sell their first home if \nApplicant\u2019s daughter and son-in-law had cooperated. Ultimately, they had to file eviction \nproceedings against their own family members to gain control of the residence. They \nattempted to sell the second home, but did not receive offers that would pay off the \nmortgages on the home. They unsuccessfully attempted to sell the home as a short \nsale, but eventually had to turn the home over to foreclosure. While Applicant and her \nhusband\u2019s decision to purchase a new home while still responsible for two mortgages \ndemonstrated questionable judgment, circumstances beyond their control contributed to \ntheir inability to pay all the mortgage payments. The fact that they pursued other \navenues to prevent the foreclosure and have no other delinquent accounts aside from \nthe mortgage foreclosure weighs heavily in their favor.  Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns raised under Guideline F.  \n \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s long career \nwith various defense contractors. I considered that Applicant and her husband had no \nother financial issues aside from the mortgage foreclosure. I considered that \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control were a factor in the inability to meet all of their \n\n \n8 \n \n \nmortgage payments.  While it did not demonstrate the best judgment to purchase \nanother home before the sale of two other homes, Applicant\u2019s seven-month period of \nunemployment contributed to her inability to pay all of her mortgage payments. During \nher security clearance application, Applicant provided detailed information as to the \nissues which led to her mortgage foreclosure. Based on her candor about the issues \nduring her background investigation, her attempts to prevent the home from being \nforeclosed, and circumstances beyond her control, including a delicate situation \ninvolving her daughter and son-in-law, Applicant met her ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable clearance decision.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n_________________ \nERIN C. HOGAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is \ngranted. \n \nApplicant completed and signed a security clearance application on June 27, \n2002. On August 1, 2007, he completed and signed a Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions. On April 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems, Guideline K, Handling \nProtected Information, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \nDecember 18, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn May 6, 2009, Applicant answered the SOR in writing. He elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On July 27, 2009, Department Counsel, \npursuant to \u00b6 E.3.1.13 of the Directive, amended the allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.a. to read as \nfollows: \u201cThat information set forth in paragraphs 1 and 2, above.\u201d Applicant answered \nthe amended allegation in writing on August 7, 2009. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 12, 2009. I convened a hearing on October 19, 2009, to consider whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. \n \nThe Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which were \nmarked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection. The Government \nprovided the following provisions from the National Industrial Security Program \nOperating Manual (NISPOM) for administrative notice: Chapter 5, Section 4, paragraphs \n5-400, 5-401, 5-402, 5-403, and 5-404 and Chapter 5, Section 5, paragraphs 5-500, 5-\n501, 5-502, and 5-509. (January 1995). The Government\u2019s administrative notice \ndocuments were marked as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. \n \n Applicant testified on his own behalf and called one witness. He introduced 13 \nexhibits, which were identified and marked as Ex. A through Ex. M. Applicant\u2019s exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on \nOctober 27, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains four allegations of disqualifying conduct under Guideline M, \nUse of Information Technology Systems, five allegations of disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information, and three allegations of disqualifying \nconduct under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Applicant admitted three of the Guideline \nM allegations and denied one; he admitted three of the Guideline K allegations and \ndenied two; he admitted one Guideline E allegation and he denied one Guideline E \nallegation. In his answer to the amended Guideline E allegation, Applicant wrote: \n\u201cPlease refer to my Answer, dated May 6, 2009, which addresses the allegations in \nparagraphs 1 and 2.\u201d I interpret Applicant\u2019s answer as a denial of amended SOR \nallegation 3.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are admitted herein as findings of fact. (Answer to \nSOR; Answer to Amended SOR.)  \n \n \nApplicant is 34 years old, married, and the father of five young children. He and \nhis wife are expecting a sixth child. Applicant grew up in a military family but has no \nmilitary service himself. (Ex. 1; Tr. 25-27.) \n \n \nApplicant graduated from college in 1997, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in \nEnglish Writing and a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theology. After graduating from \ncollege, he got a job writing technical manuals. That job led to employment in the \n\n \n3 \n \n \ndefense industry, and he was first granted a security clearance in 1997 or 1998. He was \nread into a special access program in 2004. He has worked for his present employer for \nalmost five years. His current job title is Network Systems Specialist. In 2006, \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance and special access eligibility were revoked by another \ngovernment agency. (Ex. 2; Ex. 4, at 5-8; Tr. 27-29, 83-84.) \n \n \nApplicant did not have an academic background in computer and information \ntechnology. He acquired his knowledge of the Windows Operating System from on-the-\njob training and from coaching from more experienced co-workers. In 1998, he worked \nat a help desk and assisted other employees with their computer problems. In 1998 and \n1999, he began to study on-line for certification as a systems engineer. His position title \nin March 1999 was Windows System Administrator. (Ex. 2 at 4; Tr. 55-58.) \n \n \nIn about 2000 or 2001, Applicant changed jobs and began working with the UNIX \nOperating System. His co-workers mentored him and provided him with on-the-job \ntraining. He also took on-line training courses to learn more about the UNIX system, \nand, in 2001 and 2002, he took information technology networking courses. From June \n2002 to March 2003, he was assigned on an information technology contract overseas \nby his defense contractor employer. His position title in February 2003 was UNIX \nSystem Administrator. (Ex. 2 at 3-4; Ex. 3 at 3; Tr. 55-57, 60-61.) \n \n \nFrom October 2003 to October 2004, Applicant was employed as a Systems \nEngineer. His job title from October 2004 to the present is Network Systems Specialist. \n(Ex. 2 at 3.) \n \n \nIn 1999, he received a security briefing for systems administrators. He recalled \nthat as a systems administrator, he was required to have periodic security briefings. His \nlast security briefing occurred in 2006 before he lost his security clearance and special \naccess eligibility. (Tr. 58-60.) \n \n  \nThe SOR alleges a number of incidents that raised security concerns under \nGuidelines M, K, and E. These events occurred between 1998 and 2006. Many of the \nSOR allegations are based on Applicant\u2019s self-reporting at the time the events occurred \nor during a polygraph interview conducted by another government agency in September \n2005. Applicant acknowledged that he did not know all the rules for protecting classified \ninformation. During the polygraph interview, he made an effort to report every incident \nhe could think of that could possibly be of security significance, even if he was unsure \nwhether his actions violated information technology policy or reflected misuse of \nsecurity systems. The facts alleged in the SOR were essentially the same facts relied \nupon by the other agency in revoking Applicant\u2019s security clearance and eligibility for \nspecial access in October 2006.  (SOR; Ex. 4 at 5-6; Tr. 40-46, 90.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. alleged, under Guideline M, that Applicant deliberately or negligently \nfailed to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other protected \ninformation by placing an unclassified music disc in a classified computer. Applicant \nadmitted putting the music disc in a classified computer. The incident occurred in 1998 \n\n \n4 \n \n \nor 1999, during the time that Applicant was a help desk employee. At the time, he \nworked with a group of more experienced information technology employees. His more \nexperienced colleagues pointed out to Applicant that it was a security violation to insert \nan unclassified music disk into a classified computer. Applicant was caught by surprise; \nhe did not realize that his action was a security violation. He initiated a discussion of the \nmatter with his security officer, who confirmed that his action was a security violation \nand advised him not to do it again. Thereafter, Applicant never put an unclassified \nmusic disk in a classified computer. (Tr. 61-63.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that in 1999, Applicant improperly transported classified \nhard drives, zip drives and zip discs from one Sensitive Compartmented Information \nFacility (SCIF) to another, in violation of Paragraph 5-400 of the National Industrial \nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), dated January 1995. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) \nApplicant admitted the action. He explained that he knew how to remove classified \nmaterials from a SCIF and was also aware of the proper wrapping procedures required \nfor taking classified material out of a building. However, on the day in question, he was \ncharged with moving classified material on a cart across a lobby between two SCIFs. \nHe did not wrap the materials and did not know that he was required to wrap the \nmaterials as he took them across the lobby from one SCIF to another. A security official \nwalked with him as he pushed the cart carrying classified material. She told him that he \nwas required to cover the classified material as he transported it across the lobby, which \nwas an unclassified space between two SCIFs. Applicant, who was new to the classified \nenvironment and had not previously known about the requirement, complied with it \nthereafter. He also reported this incident during his polygraph interview. (SOR; Answer \nto SOR at 3; Tr. 63-65.) \n \n \nAlso in 1999, Applicant removed a password list from a computer and took it to \nhis home, in violation of another government agency\u2019s security policy. This incident was \nalleged at SOR \u00b6 2.b. Applicant was responsible for creating user accounts and \npasswords. After creating such a list, he put it in his back pocket, intending to take it \nback through a SCIF and to place it in a safe. He then went on to other administrative \ntasks. When he left his work site at the end of the day, he forgot that he had the list and \ninadvertently took it home with him. When he discovered the list, he burned it. The next \nday, he reported the incident to his security officer, who commended him for reporting \nthe incident but did not brief Applicant on his security responsibilities. The security \nofficer observed that the list was at low risk for compromise because it was not \nassociated with the classified system. Thereafter, when Applicant acquired password \nlists in the course of his daily work, he put them in an envelope to remind himself that he \nhad the lists in his possession and was responsible for placing them in a safe. When the \nthree security incidents occurred in 1999, Applicant had not had any organized training \nin handling situations dealing with classified information that occurred during the course \nof his employment. (SOR; Answer to SOR, dated May 6, 2009, at 3-4; Tr. 65-66.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.c. that from October 2003 to October 2004, Applicant \nviolated the need-to-know policy by discussing classified launch information with a co-\nworker without first determining the co-worker\u2019s access and level of clearance, in \n\n \n5 \n \n \nviolation of Paragraph 5-500 of the NISPOM. Because he believed that dates were not \ncorrect, Applicant denied the allegation at his hearing. (See Tr. 37-39.) Applicant \nadmitted he and the co-worker had a five-minute conversation on one day, and he \ndenied that he had held unauthorized communications with the individual for a 12-month \nperiod. Applicant provided the following additional information: \n \nWe were actually cleared at the same level but I didn\u2019t know his level- - - I \ndidn\u2019t know what programs he had been read into. So, this was again like I \nsaid a five-minute conversation and I made an illusion or I alluded to a \nparticular launch that had something to do with a site that we both had \nsupported. No classified information was discussed. But at that time I \nrealized that we hadn\u2019t had a third party introduction so I didn\u2019t know \nwhether or not he had been read into the particular program so we \nstopped talking about it and never discussed it since. \n \n(Tr. 38.) \n \nApplicant further stated: \u201cThough no classified information was communicated, I learned \nthe importance of not alluding to programs at the risk of revealing need-to-know \ninformation. I have never disclosed classified information to anyone without first \ndetermining his or her level of access before or after this incident.\u201d (Answer to SOR, \ndated May 6, 2009, at 4.)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 2.d. that each day, from February to May 2005, Applicant \ncarried an unclassified floppy disc in and out of secure areas and facilities, which was a \nviolation of another government agency\u2019s security policies. In his answer to the SOR, \nApplicant denied the allegation and stated that it did not constitute a failure to properly \nhandle protected information or to comply with another agency\u2019s security policy. He \nexplained that he self-reported the incident and also may have discussed it in a \npolygraph interview in September 2005, but he learned later from his security officer \nthat he was permitted to carry discs in and out of a SCIF as long as they were virus \nscanned and labeled \u201cunclassified.\u201d The person who issued him the floppy disc assured \nhim that the disc had been labeled and scanned to comply with another government \nagency\u2019s security policy. (Answer to SOR, dated May 6, 2009, at 4; Tr. 39-42.) \n \n \nIn February 2005, Applicant reported for work in a SCIF. He hung up his coat and \nforgot that he had left his cell phone in his coat pocket. At the end of the day, he put on \nhis coat, put his hand in his coat pocket, and discovered his cell phone. This incident \nwas alleged at SOR \u00b6 2.e. (Tr. 66-67.) \n \n \nBecause he had heard that it was a security violation to have a cell phone in a \nSCIF, Applicant immediately went to his security officer and reported the incident. The \nsecurity officer asked Applicant to provide an e-mail incident report, which he did. \nApplicant did not receive a security briefing or remedial training from his employer as a \nresult of reporting the incident. In his answer to the SOR Applicant stated: \u201cI discussed \nthis issue with my [personnel security officer] who explained it\u2019s a very common \n\n \n6 \n \n \noccurrence for people to inadvertently carry their cell phone into the SCIF. I have only \ndone this once unintentionally, and have since then refrained from removing my cell \nphone from my vehicle during SCIF work days.\u201d (Answer to SOR, dated May 6, 2009, at \n4; Ex. 6; Tr. 67.) \n \n \nFrom about November 2004 to September 2005, while working as a system \nadministrator, Applicant was tasked with updating operating system patches on a \nclassified computer system. The SOR alleged at \u00b6 1.b. that Applicant \u201croutinely \ntransferred patches for certain operational systems from an unclassified computer to a \nclassified computer system, downloading a majority of these patches from the Internet \nand placing them on . . . read/writable discs and downloading them onto a classified \nsystem.\u201d  In order to accomplish this task, Applicant would copy the patches from the \nunclassified computer to a CD. After copying the patches to the CD, and before putting \nthe CD in a classified computer system, it was necessary to apply a read-only software \nlock on the CD so that nothing further could be copied to it. (Answer to SOR, dated May \n6, 2009, at 2; Tr. 68-69.) \n \n \nApplicant did not know he was required to apply the lock to the CD before putting \nit into the classified computer system. Additionally, on one or two occasions, he \nremoved an unlocked CD from a classified computer, returned it to the unclassified \ncomputer, added additional patches, and added it to the classified computer again. One \nof Applicant\u2019s more experienced co-workers explained to him that it would be an \nimproper use of government equipment not to lock an unclassified CD before putting it \nin a classified computer. Applicant went to his security officer to verify his co-worker\u2019s \nadvice. Applicant received no remedial security training after this event. (Answer to \nSOR, dated May 6, 2009, at 2; Tr. 70-72.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.c. that in about June 2006, Applicant granted himself \nelevated domain access without prior authorization or permission. Applicant admitted \ngranting himself elevated domain access, without following the regular procedure of \nrequesting permission from the relevant system administrator, in order to carry out \nclassified duties that mirrored unclassified duties for which he held elevated domain \naccess. Applicant admitted that he did this once. He stated that while he had not been \nbriefed on the issue, his common sense told him that \u201c[i]f you want to get higher access \nand you\u2019re another system administrator, go talk to the guy who administers that system \nand he\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d (Tr. 73-74.) \n \n \nApplicant further explained that in his effort to get the job done, he did not reflect \non the need to seek permission. He noted that he was responsible for performing the \nsame work on the classified system as on the unclassified system, and to perform the \nwork on the classified system, he required elevated domain access. In his answer to the \nSOR, he stated: \u201cI admit making this decision was [imprudent], but that it occurred only \nonce and I now frequently consult management and security before performing any \naction that may be questionable.\u201d (Answer to SOR, dated May 6, 2009, at 2-3; Tr.  74.) \n  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.d. that in about 2006, Applicant left his user \naccount open and unattended without password protection. Applicant denied the \nallegation and asserted that it overstated the vulnerability of his account to unauthorized \naccess. He explained that he was troubleshooting password and authentication issues \non a classified system, and to complete his testing of the system, he had \u201cto blank-out \nmy account password which would enable login without typing a password.\u201d (Answer to \nSOR, dated May 6, 2009.) \n \n \nApplicant further explained that he worked on the troubleshooting and password \nissues for about a week and logged out of this account daily. He then moved to other \nassignments and forgot about the account. He remembered the account about six \nmonths later. When he accessed the account, he realized that it was still without a \npassword. He disabled the account immediately and verbally reported the incident to \nresponsible security personnel. The security officer to whom Applicant gave his verbal \nreport advised him to be more careful in the future, and requested that he provide a \nwritten report of the incident. Applicant provided his security office with an e-mail that \ndiscussed the incident in greater detail.  He stated that he had checked the server and \nfound no evidence that anyone had used his user name to enter the classified system \nduring the time when his account had no password. Applicant received neither a formal \nnotice of a security violation nor remedial training following his report of the incident, \nand his access was not revoked.  (Answer to SOR, dated May 6, 2009; Ex. 5; Tr. 31-37, \n73-77.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that the security concerns alleged under Guidelines M and K \nalso raised security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.a.). When \nApplicant was interviewed by a polygrapher in September 2005, he tried to think of any \npossible issues that might affect his veracity or security worthiness. He told the \npolygrapher that between mid-2004 and May 2005, he drove his vehicle while \nintoxicated on at least five occasions. This behavior was alleged at SOR \u00b6 3.b. In his \nanswer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation and asserted that he had no way to \ndetermine if his conduct demonstrated intoxication as defined by the law of his state. \nApplicant has never been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. He stated \nthat he has not driven his vehicle when he has thought he might be intoxicated for about \n3 \u00bd years. (Answer to SOR, dated May 6, 2009, at 5; Tr. 43-49.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged at \u00b6 3.c. that Applicant\u2019s security clearance and program \naccess were revoked in October 2006 by another government agency \u201cas a result of a \nseries of security violations that raised questions concerning [his] ability to protect \nsensitive and classified information.\u201d The allegation also recited in SOR \u00b6 3.c. that \nApplicant\u2019s appeal of the revocation was denied by another government agency in May \n2007. The 2006 revocation by another government agency was based on the same \nadverse facts alleged in the SOR.  (Tr. 53-54.) \n \n \nApplicant stated that in the three years since losing his security clearance, he \nhad grown greatly in technical competence and awareness of his security \nresponsibilities. He stated that his increased competence had led his employer to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nentrust him with greater responsibilities, which, in turn, had led him to increase his \ntechnical skills. In 2007 and 2008, he took additional courses in hardware and software \nstorage architecture in order to be better able to serve the information technology needs \nof his employer. (Tr. 51-53, 57.) \n \n \nApplicant also reported maturity in his personal life. As the father of a large \nfamily, he is aware of his responsibility to lead by example. He reported that his alcohol \nintake had diminished as he assumed more familial responsibilities. He resolved never \nto drive a vehicle if he felt intoxicated. Applicant\u2019s witness, a friend from his college \nyears, praised Applicant\u2019s moral character and integrity. The witness holds Applicant up \nas a model to his own children and tells them:  \u201c[Y]ou need to behave as this man does. \nHe does the right thing even when he\u2019s in bad circumstances. Even to the detriment of \nhimself, he does what he considers right and what is truthful.\u201d (Tr. 44-49, 52-53, 100.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current manager, who has known him for 10 years, provided a letter \nof character reference on his behalf. In her letter, the manager praised Applicant\u2019s \nstrong technical skills, ability to mentor other employees, dependability, and reliability. \nShe observed that Applicant \u201chas always been the technical backbone of the team\u201d and \n\u201cencourages the team to document technical processes once they have been figured \nout so that it doesn\u2019t have to be figured out in the future.\u201d The manager also provided \nthe following observation: \n \nI understand the concerns you have listed regarding [Applicant\u2019s] past \nactions while he had a security clearance but I do not believe there will be \nany more issues of poor judgment. I believe that some of the non-\ncompliance with rules regarding information technology may have \noccurred while [Applicant] was coming up to speed with working in this \nenvironment. Too often the system administrators are so busy with putting \nout fires that they forget the password list is in their pocket or folder and \nmistakenly go home with it still there. Sometimes in a rush to get a system \ngoing, they forget that carrying a classified hard drive or CD from one \nbuilding to another is not acceptable. I do not feel that any of the issues \nthat have come up in the past were done by [Applicant] with any malicious \nintent behind them. I know [Applicant] is truly dedicated to the mission of \nthe work we do here and maybe he was so focused on getting the users \nback up and working so the mission could be accomplished that he wasn\u2019t \nas careful with the smaller, yet important, security steps. \n       \n(Ex. C.) \n \n \nAdditional co-workers, supervisors, and personal friends also provided letters of \ncharacter reference on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They praised him as technically proficient, \ndiligent, conscientious, truthful, dedicated, and a hard worker. They identified him as \nproductive and dedicated to the mission of his office. One co-worker, who has worked \nwith Applicant for seven years, praised Applicant\u2019s security awareness and respect for \nthe rules and procedures that ensure data integrity. He observed that Applicant\u2019s \n\n \n9 \n \n \nheightened conscience and desire to protect classified information led him to focus on \npast small mistakes. Another manager observed that \u201cthe overwhelming share of \n[Applicant\u2019s] actions were proper and positive in ensuring that information was properly \nhandled---only a few problems were self-reported by [Applicant], who is very diligent in \nthat regard.\u201d (Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. D; Ex. E; Ex. F; Ex. G.) \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s performance evaluations from 2006, 2007, and 2008 praised \nApplicant as \u201cconscientious and dependable.\u201d The quality of his work was identified as \n\u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201csuperb,\u201d and \u201ccritical to the success of the team.\u201d He received individual or \nsmall team spot awards in 2005, 2006, and 2008. (Ex. H; Ex. I; Ex. J; Ex. K; Ex. L; Ex. \nM.)  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, and \nit has emphasized that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the \nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nUse of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 describes the Guideline M security concern as follows: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nBetween 1998 and 2006, Applicant was involved in four incidents of \nnoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations pertaining to \ninformation technology systems. The first incident occurred in 1998 or 1999, when he \ninserted an unclassified music disc in a classified computer. The second incident \noccurred in 2004 and 2005, when he failed to put a read-only software lock on a CD \nbefore inserting it into a classified computer and transferring operating system patches \ncopied from an unclassified source. The third incident occurred in June 2006, when he \ngranted himself elevated domain status without prior authorization or permission in \norder to carry out his assigned duties. The fourth incident occurred in 2006, when \n\n \n11 \n \n \nApplicant left his user account without password protection for approximately six \nmonths. These incidents raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a), 40(e), and 40(f).  \nAG \u00b6 40(a) reads: \u201cillegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system \nor component thereof.\u201d  AG \u00b6 40(e) reads: \u201cunauthorized use of a government or other \ninformation technology system.\u201d AG \u00b6 40(f) reads: \u201cintroduction, removal, or duplication \nof hardware, firmware, software, or media to or from any information technology system \nwithout authorization, when prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations.\u201d \n \n \nThere are three conditions that could mitigate Guideline M security concerns.  If \n\u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(a) might apply.  \nIf \u201cthe misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational efficiency and \neffectiveness, such as letting another person use one\u2019s password or computer when no \nother timely alternative was readily available,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(b) might apply.  Finally, if \n\u201cthe conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a prompt good-faith \neffort to correct the situation and by notification of supervisor,\u201d then AG \u00b6 41(c) might \napply. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s insertion of an unclassified music disc into a classified computer \noccurred in 1998 or 1999, soon after he began working in information technology. He \ndid not know that putting an unclassified music disc in a classified computer was an \nunauthorized use of a government information technology system. When he questioned \na security officer and learned that his action was not authorized, he never did it again.  \n \n \nIn 2004 and 2005, Applicant carried out an assignment to update operating \nsystem patches on a classified computer. He did not know that he was required to use a \nread only lock on the CD containing the materials to be transferred to a classified \ncomputer system. When he learned from a co-worker that this was a requirement, he \nverified it with a program security officer and thereafter complied. \n \n \nIn 2006, he granted himself elevated domain status without prior authorization or \npermission. While Applicant had not received specific training on the subject, he \nsuspected that he should request permission for elevated domain status from a system \nadministrator. At the same time he was aware that his on-going duties required that he \nuse and exercise the elevated domain status. In the interest of getting the job done, he \ngranted himself the elevated domain status. Upon reflection, he concluded that his \ndecision was imprudent. He never repeated the action, and when similar issues arise, \nhe consults his security officer before initiating action. \n \n \nIn 2006, Applicant used his account to troubleshoot password and authentication \nissues. He blanked out his password, which enabled him to logon without typing a \npassword. After working on the password and authentication issues, he signed out of \nhis account and went on to another project. The account was not password protected \nfor six months. No entries were made on the account and no security breaches \noccurred. When Applicant discovered the status of his account, he disabled it \n\n \n12 \n \n \nimmediately and reported the situation to his security officer. He filed a report. His \nsecurity officer advised him to be more careful in the future. He received neither a notice \nof security violation nor remedial training.  His access was not revoked by his employer. \n \n \nThree years have passed since the security concerns alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. and \n1.d.  Nearly five years have passed since the security concern alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.b., \nand ten years have passed since the security concern alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. At his \nhearing, Applicant provided testimonial and documentary evidence to establish that the \nGuideline M conduct alleged in the SOR is not likely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nhis present reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. He also established that the \nalleged actions were either of a minor nature or done in the interest of organizational \nefficiency. Moreover, he established that the alleged conduct was unintentional or \ninadvertent, and it was followed by notification of a supervisor or security official and a \ngood-faith effort to correct the situation. Accordingly, I conclude that AG \u00b6 41(a), AG \u00b6 \n41(b), and AG \u00b6 41(c) apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nAG \u00b6 33 describes the Guideline K security concern as follows: \u201cDeliberate or \nnegligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified or other \nsensitive information raises doubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, \nreliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such information. . . .\u201d \n \n \nApplicant credibly established that the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.d. did not \nconstitute a violation of another government agency\u2019s security policy. Accordingly, that \nallegation is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant learned that he was improperly transporting classified hard \ndrives, zip drives, and zip discs from one SCIF to another on the same floor and in the \nsame building. Also in 1999, Applicant removed a password list from a computer, put it \nin his pocket, forgot he had it in his pocket, and discovered it when he arrived home. In \nabout 2003 or 2004, he had a brief conversation with a co-worker in which a reference \nwas made to a launch. Applicant realized he did not know the co-worker\u2019s level of \naccess and he discontinued the conversation as inappropriate. In 2005, Applicant left \nhis cell phone in his coat pocket in a SCIF during one work day. These actions raise \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 34 (g), which reads: \u201cany failure to comply with rules for \nthe protection of classified or other sensitive information.\u201d  \n \n \nUnder Guideline K, there are three mitigating conditions. AG \u00b6 35 (a) reads: \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so infrequently or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 35 (b) reads: \n\u201cthe individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now \ndemonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n35(c) reads: \u201cthe security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\u201d \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \n \nThe incidents that gave rise to security concerns occurred in 1999,  2003 or \n2004, and 2005, and they are therefore not recent. Applicant\u2019s security incidents \nhappened under unusual circumstances; he reported them and sought clarification from \nsupervisors or security officers about how to handle them properly in order to avoid \nsecurity problems in the future. \n \n \nApplicant appears to have had general periodic security briefings, but he was not \nformally trained or made aware of many day-to-day details in protecting classified \ninformation. In his concern to protect classified information, he remembered every \ninfraction, real or suspected. However, he also took it upon himself to seek answers \nfrom his supervisors and security officers when he had questions about security issues \nand how to protect classified information. He responded favorably to their suggestions, \nand he now demonstrates a very positive attitude toward the discharge of his security \nresponsibilities. I conclude that, when viewed in light of Applicant\u2019s present reputation \nfor care and diligence, it is not likely that similar incidents will occur in the future, and \nthese incidents do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. None of the alleged security concerns resulted in the compromise of \nclassified information. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 35(a), 35(b), and 35(c) apply to the facts of \nApplicant\u2019s case.  \n \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \n \n\u201cConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.\u201d  AG \n\u00b615. \n \n \nApplicant argued that the allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.c. was inconsistent with the \nadjudicative process specified at \u00b6 2(b) in the Directive because it relied not on \nApplicant\u2019s own conduct but on an adjudication of his security worthiness arrived at by \nanother government agency. Further, Applicant argued that Appeal Board precedent \nrequired that an administrative judge not defer to a previous adjudication based on the \nsame underlying facts unless it could be established that the other agency\u2019s revocation \nhad a security significant independent of the underlying reasons for the revocation.  See \nISCR Case No. 03-09212 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2006). (Tr. 53-54, 123-124.)  \n \n \n  Applicant argued persuasively that the SOR allegation at \u00b6 3.c. did not identify a \ndisqualifying condition under the Directive and Appeal Board precedent. I conclude that \nthe other government agency\u2019s 2006 revocation of Applicant\u2019s security clearance did not \nhave security significance independent of the underlying reasons for the revocation. \nAccordingly, I conclude the allegation at SOR \u00b6 3.c. for Applicant. \n \n \nThe amended SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with rules and \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems and his deliberate or negligent \nfailure to comply with rules and regulations for protecting classified information also \nraised security concerns under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. Specifically, allegations \n\n \n14 \n \n \nof Appellant\u2019s alleged personal conduct related to allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through \n1.d, and \u00b6\u00b6 2.a. through 2.e. The amended SOR alleged at \u00b6 3.a. that Applicant\u2019s \nconduct under Guidelines M and K raised doubts about his judgment, reliability, and \nability to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \n \nAdditionally, the SOR alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant\u2019s self-reported \nstatement that for about a year, during 2004 and 2005, he drove his vehicle five times \nwhile intoxicated raised security concerns. Applicant denied this allegation, pointing out \nthat he had no way of knowing if he was legally intoxicated when he drove his vehicle at \nthose times.  \n \n \nApplicant identified ten incidents, occurring during the period from 1998 to 2006,   \nwhich he believed violated security regulations. He reported these incidents when he \nhad an interview with a polygrapher. The allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a. and 3.b. raise \nsecurity concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c), which reads:  \n \nCredible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other since guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard \nprotected information. \n \n \n   \nI have considered all of the Personal Conduct disqualifying conditions, several of \nwhich appear to have applicability in this case.  If \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much \ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or if it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(c) might apply. If \u201cthe \nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the \nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or \nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur,\u201d then AG \u00b6 17(d) might apply. \n \n \nNone of the nine Guideline M and Guideline K incidents that Applicant reported \ngave rise to a written or formal security violation or to remedial training. When he \nreported these incidents to his manager or to a security officer, Applicant was advised to \nbe more careful in the future. Applicant diligently sought direction from his managers \nand security officers so that he could improve his security awareness. \n \n \n Applicant reported that he drove while intoxicated five times in 2004 and 2005, \nand this behavior was alleged at SOR \u00b6 3.b. The record reflects that Applicant has \nnever been arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol. At his hearing he credibly \nstated that he no longer drinks as much as he once did, and he does not drive if he has \nbeen drinking. In his personal life, Applicant has taken positive steps to avoid any \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or inappropriate behavior related to alcohol use and driving. In \n\n \n15 \n \n \nhis personal and his professional life, Applicant consciously sought to avoid repeating \nbehavior that he knew raised security concerns. I conclude that the mitigating conditions \nat AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case.  \n    \n \n \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult. He \nholds himself to a very high standard of rectitude. Several of the security incidents \nattributed to him resulted from a lack of training and information. He has learned from \nhis mistakes, and he now does not hesitate to seek timely and sufficient information to \nprotect the information he is entrusted with. \n \nI observed Applicant carefully at his security clearance hearing.  I found him to be \na serious and responsible person. I believe it is highly unlikely that in the future he will \nfail to carry out any of the responsibilities of a person entrusted with a security \nclearance and the protection of classified information. I conclude that he is not a \nsecurity risk. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and eligibility and suitability for a security clearance, and I \nconclude Applicant rebutted and mitigated all security concerns arising under Guideline \nM, Guideline K, and Guideline E. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n16 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \n                    FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d:          For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline K:  \n \n         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e.:          For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a. through 3.c.:            For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Minster, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 14 April 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing trustworthiness concerns under\nGuideline F.  Applicant answered the SOR 2 July 2009, requesting a hearing. DOHA\n1\nassigned the case to me 28 August 2009, and I convened a hearing 23 September\n2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 30 September 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 46-year-old\ninfrastructure analyst employed by a defense contractor since February 1997. He will\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n2\nhave access to sensitive medical data. He has not previously had a trustworthiness\ndetermination. He has two adult children with his first wife, whom he divorced in October\n1999, and a six-year-old son with his second wife, whom he divorced in July 2007.\nThe SOR alleges, government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits, 21\ndelinquent debts totaling over $43,000, falling delinquent between 2003 and the\npresent. Most of the debts are small: 12 are less than $500 each. However, Applicant\nhas made no efforts to resolve the debts, and is unlikely to do so in the future.\nApplicant acknowledges making poor financial judgments in the past, but also\nattributes his financial problems to multiple separations and reconciliations with his\nsecond wife beginning in 2003 and culminating in their divorce in July 2007. Initially, his\nex-wife had custody of their son, but Applicant was given custody in August 2008 amid\nallegations of domestic violence in the home where the ex-wife lived with her new\nhusband. There is some possibility that she will be ordered to pay Applicant child\nsupport. However, it seems unlikely that she will pay voluntarily if child support is\nordered.\nApplicant has received no financial counseling and has attempted no debt\nconsolidation or resolution. He has made no payments on his debts and acknowledges\nnot knowing where to start. He has considered filing for bankruptcy protection, but lacks\nthe spare funds to pay the filing fees. He hoped to be able to start addressing his debts\nonce his educational loan garnishment was completed in July 2009, but the fluidity of\nthe situation with his son and ongoing legal expenses have made that impossible.\nApplicant submitted no character or employment records. The case record\nsuggests that few people are aware of his financial problems.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for public trust positions. Administrative judges must\nassess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the\nfacts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair and impartial\ncommonsense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a), the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nfactors. The presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative for or against applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should\nbe followed where a case can be measured against them, as they represent policy\nguidance governing the grant or denial of access to sensitive information. Considering\nthe SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative\nguideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations).\nPublic trust determinations resolve whether it is clearly consistent with national\nsecurity to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for public trust positions. The\ngovernment must prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence,\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (b) . . . the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent\n3\nto pay the debt or establish a realistic plan to pay the debt; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n\u00b6 20 (a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n4\nit is  unlikely to recur.\n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n5\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\u00b6 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n6\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n7\n3\nagainst access to classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or\nmitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to eligibility the applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to public trust information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with national security\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the trustworthiness concerns. While some of Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial difficulties are reasonably attributable to the long process of separation and\ndivorce from his second wife, he has been unable to take effective action to address his\ndebts despite being employed full time since February 1997. However, his debts were\nalso due to his irresponsible spending.3\nApplicant potentially meets only one of the mitigating factors for financial\nconsiderations. His financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, indeed they are\nongoing.  While his second divorce and getting custody of his son were clearly\n4\ncircumstances beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly in addressing his debts\nsince then, having not even resolved several small debts.  Further, he remains unable\n5\nto live within his means. In addition, there is no evidence that he has sought credit\ncounseling or otherwise brought the problem under control.  There is very little\n6\nevidence, and no corroboration, of any good-faith effort to satisfy his debts.  Finally,\n7\ngiven his unwillingness to seek or use financial counseling, there is nothing in the record\nto suggest that Applicant will put his financial problems behind him. I conclude Guideline\nF against Applicant.\n\n4\nBeyond the specific guidelines alleged by the government, the generally\napplicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions lead to the same result. Applicant is\npresumably a responsible adult, who nevertheless appears unsophisticated about his\nfinances. Overall, the record evidence leaves substantial doubt about Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has\nnot mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his financial problems.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: B. Daniel Lynch, Esquire\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn May 19, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of\nApplicant eligibility for occupying an automatic data processing (ADP) public trust\nposition, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a\ntrustworthiness eligibility determination should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 19, 2009, and requested a hearing.  The\ncase was assigned to me on July 16, 2009, and was initially scheduled for hearing on\nSeptember 16, 2009, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s\neligibility to hold a public trust position. The hearing was rescheduled for October 7,\n2009.  A hearing was held as rescheduled.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted\nJanuary 8, 2010\n\n2\nof three exhibits; Applicant relied on five witnesses (including himself) and five exhibits\n(A-E)  The transcript (Tr.) was received on November 9, 2009.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to hold a public trust position\nis granted.\nBesides the exhibits offered by the parties, I took administrative notice of three\ndocuments: Background Note: India, U.S. Department of State (November 2009);\nConsular Information Sheet, U.S. Department of State (July 2009); 2008 Country\nReports on Human Rights Practices: India, U.S. Department of State (February 2009).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative\nproceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-\n24875 (App. Bd. October 2006).  Administrative notice is appropriate for noticing facts or\ngovernment reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative Law, Sec. 25.01\n(Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was granted with\nrespect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical situation in\nIndia.  \nProcedural Issues and Rulings\nBefore the close of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to\nconform to the presented evidence of Applicant\u2019s brother and sister being citizens and\nresidents of India.  For good cause shown, Department Counsel\u2019s motion to amend was\ngranted.  Subparagraph. 2.f was added to the SOR to read as follows: \u201cYour brother and\nsister are citizens and residents of India.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions to the amended\nallegation were added to the SOR (Tr. 111).  \nPrior to the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to keep the record\nopen to enable him to supplement the record with additional endorsements.  For good\ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record.  The\nGovernment was afforded two days to reply. Within the time permitted, Applicant\nsupplemented the record with three additional endorsements. They were admitted as\nexhibit F.\nSummary of Pleadings\n  \nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to: (1) exercise dual citizenship with India\nby possessing an Indian passport issued in April 2007, and due to expire in March 2017,\nand (2) intend to obtain an overseas citizenship of India card.\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to: (a) have a mother who is a citizen and\nresident of India, (b) own property in India, which he inherited from his father, (c) have a\nbank account in India, (d) be employed by a company affiliated with his employer\nthrough common ownership and management by an Indian-based company, and (e)\nhave traveled to India in December 2002 and December 2007. \n\n3\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have falsified his  application for a\npublic trust position (SF-85P) by stating he completed his Master of Science degree in\ncomputer science engineering (MSCSE)  in September 1996; whereas, he had not been\nawarded  his MSCSE degree at the time he completed his application.\nIn his answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR with\nexplanations. He claimed (a) he is required to surrender his Indian passport to the Indian\nconsulate upon receiving citizenship of a foreign country and (b) he is considering filing\n(albeit, he had not yet done so) for an overseas citizenship of India card (OCI) for the\nsole purpose of making it more convenient to visit India. \nApplicant  explained in his response that he intends to file for U.S. immigration\npapers for his mother; he intends to sell his India property and purchase a home in the\nU.S.; he intends to close his bank account in India after he sells his Indian property; and\nhe traveled to India in 2002 and 2007 to visit his mother and other relatives who reside in\nIndia, and not for any other purpose.  Applicant claimed he made a mistake in claiming a\nMSCSE degree on his SF-85P, pending results of two additional courses he needed to\ncomplete his degree curriculum. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 47 year-old software architect and systems programmer for a\ndefense contractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR\nand admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in India and attended high school there. While a\ncitizen and resident of India, he obtained bachelors degrees in his chosen field of\nengineering in 1984 (see ex. B). \nIn February 1993, Applicant immigrated to the United States (U.S.) to pursue\ngraduate studies in  engineering. (Tr. 127, 129).  Once a resident of the U.S., he enrolled\nin an accredited graduate school and pursued an engineering curriculum between 1993\nand 1996 (ex. 2).  He completed all but two thesis-related courses in June 1996, but\nfailed to complete the two added courses necessary for him to receive his degree (see\nex. 2; Tr. 90-91).\nApplicant  married his spouse in 1985 in India; he has one child from his marriage\n(see ex. 1; Tr. 130). Applicant\u2019s wife moved to the United States in 1991, and is currently\na practicing cardiologist.  Applicant followed his spouse to the United States two years\nlater (Tr. 130-31).  Both Applicant and his wife applied for green cards in 1993 and\nreceived them in 1998.  Once they received their green cards, they applied for U.S.\ncitizenship. They became naturalized U.S. citizens in January 2008 (see ex.  2; Tr. 99-\n100, 130), and received their U.S. passports in May 2008 (see ex. 1).  After obtaining his\n\n4\nU.S. citizenship, Applicant retained his Indian passport.  This passport was reissued to\nhim in April 2007, upon expiration of his old Indian passport.  His reissued Indian\npassport was due to expire in March 2017 (see exs. 1 and 2).\nIn January 2009, Applicant expressed his intention to use his Indian passport to\napply to his local Indian consulate for an overseas citizenship card to enable him to\nobtain a multiple entry visa for visiting his family members in India (see ex. 2).  Applicant\nhas since reconsidered and will not apply for an overseas citizenship card, citing\nrestrictions in India\u2019s constitution that prevent a foreign citizen from retaining Indian\ncitizenship (Tr. 93-94). He documents surrendering his Indian passport in July 2009 to an\nIndian consulate, who cancelled the passport (see ex. E; Tr. 92-93, 125).  He waited\nover 18 months after gaining his U.S. citizenship, however, to surrender his Indian\npassport (Tr. 100, 126).  He attributes his delay to \u201cbeing caught up in work\u201d and the lack\nof any need to travel during this time frame (Tr. 126).   \nApplicant\u2019s late father was a high-ranking administrative services officer for the\nIndian government (Tr. 102-03).  He retired in 1984 and passed away in 1999 (see ex. 2;\nTr. 102). Currently, Applicant has a number of immediate family members who are\ncitizens and residents of India.  His mother (age 78) and two siblings (a brother and a\nsister) are each citizens and residents of the country (ex. 1; Tr. 97, 102, 105-06). His\nsister is married and has two children (Tr. 124). Neither his  mother nor his sister have\nexpressed any desire to emigrate from India (Tr.  97-98, 121-23).  His brother has\nexpressed interest in moving to the United States. to support his daughter\u2019s education\npursuits (Tr. 122-23).\nSince May 2008, Applicant has been employed by a local software company that\nwas founded by A (a naturalized U.S. citizen) and is a part of a group of companies\n(including an Indian company) that are affiliated by virtue of common ownership and\nmanagement (see exs. 3 and F; Tr. 56-60). According to Applicant\u2019s furnished\ndocumentation, his employer is owned mostly by its founder (A).  His employer, in turn,\nowns a 49 per cent stake in his employer\u2019s Indian affiliate (see exs. 3 and E).  Other U.S.\ncitizens own 30 to 40 per cent of the Indian company.  Most importantly, local Indian\nresidents own no more than 10 per cent of the Indian company according to A\u2019s best\nestimates (Tr. 58). The other affiliated U.S. company founded by A is wholly owned by\nA\u2019s Indian company and is also controlled and managed by A (see exs. 3 and E; Tr. 58-\n59).  \nWhile A is able to exert considerable control over Applicant\u2019s employer and its\nIndian affiliate by virtue of his controlling interests in both firms, the Indian subsidiary has\nno independent controlling interest in Applicant\u2019s employer and no equitable basis to\nassert any corporate control over Applicant\u2019s business decisions.  Applicant himself has\nno working knowledge or involvement in the business operations of his employer and its\naffiliates in the United States and India.\nBefore his death in 1999, Applicant\u2019s father received a retirement pension from\nthe Indian government (Tr. 103-04).  His pension passed to Applicant\u2019s mother upon his\n\n5\ndeath (Tr. 104).  His mother has no separate pension of her own (Tr. 104).  Applicant\nhas no relatives of either his immediate family or extended family who currently work for\nthe Indian government.  He  maintains monthly contact with his mother and little contact\nwith either of his siblings (Tr. 113-14).  No government or military officials have ever tried\nto exert any pressure or influence over his immediate and extended family members.\nFollowing his father\u2019s death, Applicant inherited property from his father that is\nlocated in India.  The property comprises two apartments, which are not worth very much\nin U.S. dollars, no more than $15,000 (Tr. 95-96, 114). He receives $1,500 a month in\nrents from these apartments, which he places in a local Indian bank account to be drawn\nupon by his brother to defray maintenance expenses associated with the property (see\nex. 2 Tr. 115-17). His brother has a power of attorney that permits him to access\nApplicant\u2019s Indian bank account (Tr. 98, 116). When he explored sale possibilities for the\napartments, he found the process too complicated and expensive to make their sale\ncost-effective (Tr. 96, 114-15).                                                                                            \n                                                                   \nApplicant  has no stock purchasing rights with his employer, and no profit sharing\nrights in his employer\u2019s business, or any of the affiliated firms associated with Applicant\u2019s\ncompany (Tr. 119).  Applicant claims substantial property interests in the United States\nwithout identifying any specific property interests.  The nature and value of his U.S.\nproperty interests cannot be determined from the information provided. \nSince 1999, Applicant has traveled to India on two occasions to visit his family: in\nDecember 2002, and again in December 2007 (Tr. 94, 117).  He used his Indian\npassport on both occasions to enter and exit India.  He foresees no need to travel to\nIndia in the future (Tr. 95, 124).\nIndia\u2019s country status\nConsidered the world\u2019s largest democratic republic, India is also a very diverse\ncountry, in population, geography and climate (see Consular Information Sheet, supra).\nIndia is the world\u2019s second most populous country and the world\u2019s seventh largest\ncountry in area (id.).\nIndia is a constitutional democracy whose Constitution defines it as a \u2018sovereign,\nsocialist, secular democratic republic\u201d (see Background Note: India, supra, at 5-6).  It is a\n\u201cmultiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament\u201d and has a\nsolid historical reputation for respecting the rights of its citizens (see id.). True, there\nhave been reports of extrajudicial killings of persons in custody, disappearances, torture\nand rape by police and security forces, who generally enjoy de facto immunity (see 2008\nCountry Reports on Human Rights Practices: India, supra, at 2-6). The basic problem\nstems from the lack of any clear accountability, which too often has resulted in cited\nhuman rights violations going unpunished (see id., at 1).  Police and security officials\nreportedly use torture and threaten violence during interrogations to extort money and\nsummarily punish prisoners (id. at 2-6).  \n\n6\nSince gaining its independence from great Britain in 1947, India has been\ninvolved in wars with Pakistan in 1947, 1965 and 1971, and has had to defend itself\nagainst a 1999 intrusion of Pakistani-backed forces into Indian-held territory that nearly\nturned into full-scale war ((see Background Note: India, supra, at 7).  India survived a\n1975 declaration of a state of emergency that carried a suspension of many civil liberties\n(see id. at 3). The country has experienced two assassinations of its leaders: Prime\nMinister Indira Ghandi in October 1984 and Prime Minister Rajiv Ghandi in May 1991\n(see id, at 4).  In recent years, India has been confronted with sporadic outbreaks of\nreligious riots, which resulted in numerous deaths and casualties, and violent attacks by\nseparatist groups in various parts of the country.\nBefore its demise in the early 1990s, the Soviet Union was India\u2019s principal and\nmost reliable trading partner, and an important source of economic and military\nassistance (see Background Note: India, supra, at 11).  Historically, U.S. efforts to\nstrengthen its ties with India have been hampered some by U.S. differences over India\u2019s\nnuclear weapons programs and the pace of India\u2019s efforts to achieve long-planned\neconomic reforms. \nIndia today is a nuclear-weapon state, and a responsible nuclear power with an\nimpeccable record for avoidance of unauthorized proliferation of weapons of mass\ndestruction. Nuclear cooperation between the United States and India was considerably\nenhanced by the strategic partnership reached between the two countries in July 2007\n(aka \u201c123 agreement).  This agreement governs civil nuclear trade between the two\ncountries and opens the door for American and Indian firms to participate in each other\u2019s\ncivil nuclear energy sector (see Background Note: India, supra, at 12).  \nNevertheless, important U.S. concerns have been raised over reported cases\ninvolving government sponsored entities and their illegal export, or attempted illegal\nexport, of U.S. restricted dual use technology to India, including (1) high-tech testing\nequipment that posed potential risks of diversion to a weapons of mass destruction\nprogram, (2) dual use equipment that can be used in military and civilian aircraft to\nextract engine vibration information, (3) equipment that can be used to manufacture\nmaterial that improves the accuracy of strategic ballistic missiles with nuclear\ncapabilities, (4) an animation system that can be diverted to weapons of mass\ndestruction technology, (5) nuclear pulse generators to two Indian entities capable of\nmounting diversion to the development of weapons of mass destruction or missiles, and\n(6) heat treating containers to an Indian entity capable of mounting diversion to the\ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction or missiles.  These concerns are likely to\nfill bilateral trade and commerce discussions between these trading partners for the\nforeseeable future.   \nRecommended travel restrictions do exist for U.S. citizens visiting India.  The\nState Department cautions U.S. citizens to avoid travel in general (with several noted\nexceptions) to the state of Jammu & Kashmir (see Consular Information Sheet, supra).\n\n7\nSF-85P omissions\nAsked to complete an SF-85P in June 2008, Applicant claimed an MSCSE degree\nfrom an accredited U.S. technical institute in September 1996 (see exs. 1 and A).  At the\ntime, Applicant had not completed his thesis and had been assigned two substitute\nwriting courses, which he needed to complete his course requirements for an MS degree\n(Tr. 90-91). He listed the MSCSE degree in his SF-85P based on the information\nprovided in his transcript; which states: \u201cDegree granted: MSCSE degree pending results\nof EE697, CS689\" (see ex. 2).  Applicant attributes his degree misstatements to a good-\nfaith misunderstanding of the data in his transcript, and not to any intention to falsify his\nacademic achievements (Tr. 91). \nApplicant\u2019s school transcript documents completion of all of his engineering\ncourse work (see ex. 2).  His explanations provide plausible accounts and reflect credible\nmistakes in interpretation of the information contained in his transcripts.  Moreover, he\nattached a copy of his transcript to his interrogatory answers without any request from\nDOHA (see ex. 2).  The transcript lists his degree pending results of two courses (ex. 2).\nHis actions reflect a good-faith effort to clarify any potential mis-impressions about his\nMSCSE claims in his SF-85P. By all accounts in the record, Applicant made a good-faith\neffort to voluntarily clarify his MSCSE claims.\nApplicant has an excellent reputation for overall honesty with friends and\ncolleagues who know him and have worked with him. Considering all of the\ncircumstances surrounding his MSCSE claims in his SF-85P, his claims warrant\ninferences that his misstatements about his degree status resulted from his mistaken\nunderstanding of his degree receipt, and not from any intention to deceive the\nGovernment.  \nEndorsements\nApplicant is well regarded by his supervisors, coworkers, and friends who have\nworked with him and are familiar with his work and candor. They describe him as a\nstrong team leader with excellent software skills and a high degree of reliability and\ntrustworthiness (see ex. D; Tr. 35-37, 75-76, and 84-85). \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) list guidelines to be used by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. These\nguidelines take into account factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the\nindividual applicant, as well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. These guidelines include\n\"[c]onditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying\nconditions), if any, and many of the \"[c]onditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance\nshould be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require administrative\n\n8\njudges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to be\nevaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(a) of\nthe revised AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a\nsufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about\nwhether the applicant is an acceptable security risk.  When evaluating an applicant\u2019s\nconduct, the relevant guidelines are to be considered together with the following AG \u00b6\n2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances\nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and\nrecency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5)\nthe extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of\ncontinuation or recurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\n     \n Foreign Preference\nThe Concern: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate preference  for\na foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  See\nAG \u00b6  9.\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism\u201d   See AG \u00b6 6.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and\n\n9\nregulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability\nto protect classified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and\ncandid answers during the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate\nwith the security clearance process.  AG \u00b6 15.\nBurden of Proof\nUnder the Directive, a decision to grant or continue an Applicant's request for\nsecurity clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that to do so is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive requires administrative judges\nto make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the\nultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in\nlarge part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all adversarial\nproceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences which have a reasonable and\nlogical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual\ninferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR; and (2) it must demonstrate that the\nfacts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nconsideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or his security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.  Because Executive Order 10865 requires that all\nsecurity clearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis\nBorn and raised in India, Applicant married his spouse in 1985, followed her to the\nUnited States in 1991, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008.  Trust concerns\nrelate to both foreign preference and foreign influence associated with Applicant\u2019s\nlongstanding ties to India, his retention of an Indian passport until recently, his company\nties to an Indian firm that is affiliated with both Applicant\u2019s firm and another U.S. firm, the\npresence of his immediate family members in India, and his preponderance of property\ninterests in India. Trust concerns are also raised over the misstatements he made in his\nSF-85P about his award of an MSCSE degree.\n\n10\nForeign Preference concerns\nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail allegiance assessments and invite\ncritical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of the\nforeign country over the interests of the United States. The issues, as such, raise\nconcerns over Applicant\u2019s  preference for a foreign country over the United States.  By\nvirtue of his birth in India to parents of Indian ancestry, Applicant acquired Indian\ncitizenship and an Indian passport, which he continued to retain even after becoming a\nU.S. citizen in 2008, and was thereupon required by India\u2019s constitution to renounce his\nforeign citizenship and relinquish his foreign passport. Not until after the issuance of the\nSOR did he surrender his Indian passport.  Whether the delay was due to personal\nreluctance to part with the passport for convenience reasons, or inertia, is not clear. \nSince becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, Applicant has taken several actions and\nexercised Indian privileges that reflect active indicia of dual citizenship.  Specifically, he\nrenewed his Indian passport in 2004, maintains modest property interests in India., and\ncontinues to work for a U.S. firm whose affiliations with another U.S. company and an\nIndian firm (both of whom are controlled by their founder), subject Applicant\u2019s firm to a\ncontrol relationship with the founder and the three companies he controls directly and\nindirectly.  Like Applicant, the founder is a naturalized U.S. citizen.\nBy contrast, Applicant holds no material assets in India that pose irreconcilable\nconflicts of interest or otherwise manifest indica of Indian preference.  The apartment\nunits he owns are two small in value (no more than $15,000) relative to the substantial\nassets he holds in the United States to create any irreconcilable conflicts of interest.\nFurther, Applicant retains no recognized Indian citizenship or passport, and has never\n(save for his possession and use of his Indian passport) performed or attempted to\nperform duties, or otherwise acted so as to serve the interests of India in preference to\nthe interests of the United States, since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2008.\nBecause Applicant continued to possess his Indian passport after becoming a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, the Government may apply disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 10(a)\nof AG \u00b6 9, \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligations of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.  This\nincludes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country; \n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such            \n           benefits from a foreign country; \n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements; \n\n11\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in another       \n           country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and\n(7) voting in a foreign election.\u201d  \nApplicant surrendered his Indian passport in July 2009, however, and may claim\nthe full benefits of several of the mitigating conditions under Guideline C.  MC \u00b6 11(a),\n\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parent\u2019s citizenship or birth in a foreign country,\u201d is\navailable to Applicant.  MC  \u00b6 11(e), \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated,\u201d is fully applicable as well to\nApplicant\u2019s situation.  Because he never followed through with his passed expressed\nintention to apply for an overseas citizenship of India card, once he realized the potential\nimplications such actions could have on his pending application for a public trust position,\ntrustworthiness concerns over this issue have dissipated for the most part.\nWhole person precepts are also helpful to Applicant in surmounting the\nGovernment\u2019s preference concerns herein.  The strong trust impressions he has been\nable to forge with his supervisors, coworkers and friends who have worked with him add\nsupport to his claims that he has undivided loyalty and preference for U.S. institutions and\nits way of life over those of his birth country (India).\nOverall, Applicant persuades that his preference is with the U.S.  He meets his\nproof burden in several ways: relatively little exercise of any privileges associated with his\nIndian citizenship and passport after his naturalization as a U.S. citizen in 2008.\nApplicant absolves himself of foreign preference concerns and carries his evidentiary\nburden on the presented issue of whether his preference lies with his adopted country\n(U.S.) or the country (India) where he was born and raised as a minor through his\nparents\u2019 Indian citizenship.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b of Guideline C.\nForeign influence concerns\nApplicant and his wife and family have deep roots in India, a country rich in history\nand socio/political traditions, constitutional government and institutional respect for human\nrights, intermixed with periodic reports of abuses by police and government authorities.\nDespite encouraging efforts in the development of strategic partnerships between India\nand the United States in recent years, there have been cited instances of illegal and\ndamaging export practices by Indian firms associated with the Indian government to\ncreate dual use diversion risks.  \nThe Government urges trust concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s mother, siblings,\nand other family members residing in India, might be subject to undue foreign influence\nby Indian government authorities to access sensitive proprietary information in Applicant\u2019s\n\n12\npossession or control.  Because Applicant and his wife have family members who have\nIndian citizenship by birth and reside currently in India, they present potential heightened\nsecurity risks covered by disqualifying condition  (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the AGs for\nforeign influence. The citizenship/residence status of these family members in India pose\nsome potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that\ncould potentially impact the privacy interests subject to Applicant\u2019s control. \nExcept for Applicant\u2019s father, none of his family members have any identified prior\nmilitary or government service.  Although his mother receives his father\u2019s pension benefits\nfrom the Indian government, she has no independent pension benefits that might create\npotential conflicts of interest.  Any potential conflict that might be associated with her\ndeceased husband\u2019s pension benefits is small and not likely to pose any conflicts of\ninterest for Applicant in the foreseeable future.  And, from all that is known, Applicant\u2019s\nspouse does not have any identified prior military or government service that could create\npotential conflicts of interest.   Accordingly, Applicant \n Because none of Applicant\u2019s living family or W\u2019s family have any identified family\nmembers that could place any of them in any foreseeable conflict situation, no\nconsideration of DC 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information,\u201d is warranted herein.\nApplicant and his immediate family members (i.e., his mother and siblings) residing\nin India have deep family roots in India.  Their citizenship status and presence in India\ndoes not by itself create a heightened risk. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members\nare manageable risks, and clearly not of the magnitude that could make them subject to a\nheightened security risk of pressure or compromise under Guideline B.  As a country,\nIndia has a lengthy history of constitutional government and generally recognized respect\nfor human rights and the rule of law.  It continues to be a country with emerging strategic\nrelationships with the United States in controlling the proliferation of nuclear weapons,\nand a country that at present does not present a heightened risk under Guideline B.\nThe AGs governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se results or mandate\nparticular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are citizens/residents of foreign\ncountries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable risk in one foreign country\nmay not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by practical necessity be\nweighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for referencing in the supplied\nmaterials and country information about India.  Unlike the old AGs, the new ones do take\ninto account of the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an important\nconsideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and residency\n\n13\nelsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies of the\nparticular foreign regime involved do matter. \nBased on his case-specific circumstances, MC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the\npersons or activities of these persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the\nU.S.\u201d  is available to Applicant.  Neither Applicant nor his immediate or extended family\nresiding in India pose heightened security risks that could subject them to potential\npressures and influence from Indian government and military officials. \nOf benefit to Applicant, too, is MC \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either\nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding\nrelationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to\nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\nloyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the United States, is well\ndemonstrated and enough under these circumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts\nthat are implicit in his relationships with his immediate.  MC \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or\ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little\nlikelihood that it could create risk for foreign influence or exploitation,\u201d has some\napplicability, too, based on Applicant\u2019s infrequent contacts with his brother and sister.\n \nOne other mitigating condition has application to Applicant\u2019s situation.  MC \u00b6 8(f),\n\u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such\nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d is fully applicable.  His financial interests in India\n(primarily an apartment unit managed by his younger brother) are relatively small, when\ncompared to the substantial interests he holds in the United States, and are not likely to\ncreate any problem conflicts in the foreseeable future.    \nWhole person assessment is available also to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflicts of interests with his Indian family members.  Most importantly, Applicant is not\naware of any risks of coercion, pressure, or influence that any of his family members\nmight be exposed to.  So, in Applicant\u2019s case, the potential risk of coercion, pressure, or\ninfluence being brought to bear on him, or any of their respective family members is\nminimal and mitigated. \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's having property\ninterests and family members residing in India are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe\npredictive judgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence\nattributable to his familial relationships in India. Favorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the allegations covered by Guideline B.\n\n14\nPersonal Conduct issues associated with Appellant\u2019s SF-85P\nTrust concerns over Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability and trustworthiness are raised\nunder Guideline E as the result of his misstatement about the status of his MSCSE\ndegree.  By claiming award of an MSCSE based on the completion of his course work in\nhis school\u2019s graduate program, Applicant mistakenly claimed an actual degree award\ninstead of a degree that was in pending status. \nApplicant\u2019s erroneous reporting of an MSCSE degree in his SF-85P is attributable\nto his mistaken belief that he earned his graduate degree and was entitled to list it on his\nSF-85P.  When later asked by DOHA to answer interrogatory questions, about his dual\ncitizenship status, he furnished an unsolicited copy of his official transcript. His\nexplanations and corrections were made in good faith and were based on his\nunderstanding that completion of his engineering  work entitled him to a degree, and the\nright to represent his accomplishments.  Applicant\u2019s explanations, considering both the\ncircumstances surrounding the furnished information at the time and Applicant\u2019s overall\nreputation for honesty and trustworthiness enable him to convincingly refute the\nfalsification allegations.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors and conditions enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(a).\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara.: 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara.:1.b:\nFor Applicant\nGUIDELINE B (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 2.a :\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubpara. 2.f:\nFor applicant\nGUIDELINE E (PERSONAL CONDUCT):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubpara. 3.a:\nFor Applicant \n\n15\n Conclusions\n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to sustain Applicant's eligibility for a public trust\nposition .

Facts\nThe Judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\nWhile still in college, Applicant obtained part-time work with a new computer technology\ncompany.  Upon graduation, Applicant became a full-time employee of the company.  In order to\nincrease the company\u2019s sales, Applicant moved to Taiwan.

Applicant\u2019s wife has received a permanent green card and is\npreparing to apply for American citizenship.  Applicant\u2019s wife has relatives in Taiwan and maintains\ncontact with her parents, brother, and paternal grandfather.  Applicant\u2019s  father-in-law served in the\nTaiwanese military as an air traffic controller, but is now retired and receives no government\nretirement benefits.  Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has worked as a switchboard operator at a Taiwanese\nmilitary base for almost 30 years, but does little work now and will retire soon.  Applicant\u2019s father-\nin-law has visited Applicant and his wife twice, and Applicant and his wife have made three trips\nto Taiwan to visit her family.  Applicant is well regarded at work.\nB.  Discussion\nDepartment Counsel\u2019s appeal involves the Judge\u2019s conclusions.\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n\n\u201cConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include: (a) contact with a foreign\n1\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion[.]\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.7(a).\n3\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\n     \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred by concluding that the government failed\nto establish a heightened risk under Guideline B.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  In his\ndecision, the Judge cited official notice documents that Taiwan is a country that actively collects\nindustrial information and engages in industrial espionage.  Decision at 2-3.  Although Applicant has\nan extensive personal history with Taiwan and Applicant\u2019s wife is not yet an American citizen and\nshe has regular communication with immediate family members in Taiwan and Applicant and his\nwife have made three trips to visit her family there, the Judge did not apply Foreign Influence\nDisqualifying Condition 7(a).   Using the Directive\u2019s language regarding the \u201cConcern\u201d under\n1\n\n\u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign\n2\nfinancial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way\nthat is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under this\nguideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest\nis located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is associated with terrorism.\u201d\nDirective \u00b6 E2.6. \nThe Judge\u2019s decision cited Mitigating Conditions 8(a), (b), (c), and (f):  \n3\n\u201c (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions\nor activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of\nhaving to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.;\u201d\n\u201c(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person,\ngroup, government, of country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep longstanding relationships and loyalties\nin the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\u201d\n\u201c (c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could\ncreate a risk for foreign influence of exploitation;\u201d . . .\n\u201c(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such that they are unlikely to\nresult in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\u201d   Directive \u00b6\nE2.8. \nSee, e.g.,ISCR Case No. 07-17673 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 2, 2009).  \n4\n4\nGuideline B,  the Judge stated that Department Counsel had not presented evidence to prove that\n2\nTaiwan targeted U.S. citizens to obtain information or was associated with terrorism. Decision at 3.\nAs Department Counsel points out, the government\u2019s concern under Guideline B includes, but is not\nlimited to, indications that the country involved targets U.S. citizens or is associated with terrorism.\nThe Judge\u2019s conclusions in this case have the practical effect of requiring Department Counsel to\nprove affirmatively that Taiwan specifically targets U.S. citizens in the course of attempts to gather\nprotected information.  The Directive does not require the Government to prove affirmatively that\na country specifically targets U.S. citizens in order to raise Guideline B security concerns that shift\nthe burden of persuasion to Applicant.  Moreover, the \u201cheightened risk\u201d language in \u00b6 E2.7(a)\naddresses an applicant\u2019s contacts, not necessarily the country involved in the contact.  See, e.g., ISCR\nCase No. 08-04488 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 23, 2009).  The Judge\u2019s conclusion in this regard is not\nsustainable.   \nDepartment Counsel also argues that the Judge\u2019s application of the Foreign Influence\nMitigating Conditions  is unsupported by the record evidence and is therefore arbitrary and\n3\ncapricious.  Department Counsel\u2019s argument has merit.  Noting Applicant\u2019s close ties to the United\nStates and his limited relationship with his in-laws, without regard for Applicant\u2019s relationship with\nhis wife, a Taiwanese citizen, or their relationships with her family in Taiwan, the Judge initially\napplied Mitigating Conditions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(f).  Decision at 10-11. However, the Judge then\ncorrectly stated that \u201cthe relationship between a spouse and the spouse\u2019s family is attributed to an\napplicant.\u201d   Decision at 10.  While attempting to  minimize the relationship between Applicant\u2019s\n4\nspouse and her mother and brother, the Judge recognized the close relationship between Applicant\u2019s\n\nWhile Applicant has a closer relationship with her father than with her mother and brother, the record evidence\n5\ndoes not support the Judge\u2019s characterization of her relationship with her mother and brother as \u201cindifferent.\u201d     \n5\nspouse and her father.   The Judge therefore stated that application of Mitigating Conditions 8(b) and\n5\n8(c) was obviated, and he applied only Mitigating Condition 8(a).  Construing the Judge\u2019s reasoning,\nit appears that in the end only Mitigating Conditions 8(a) and 8(f) were applicable.  Applicant\u2019s\nrelationships with his Taiwanese wife and her Taiwanese family are a factor to be considered in\nMitigating Condition 8(a), as to whether he could be placed in a position of having to choose between\nthe interests of her and her family and the United States.  The Judge stated that he recognized that\n\u201cTaiwan may be a collector or [sic] economic information\u201d and that \u201cthe [Peoples Republic of China]\nmay use operatives stationed within Taiwan[.]\u201d Decision at 11.  However, he based his application\nof Mitigating Condition 8(a) on the lack of evidence that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law \u201cis an enemy of\nthe United States or that his daughter\u2019s marriage has triggered any form of inquiry by governmental\nor other agents.\u201d  Id.  The Directive does not require evidence of either of  those matters.  The Judge\nalso stated that there is \u201cno indication that Taiwan uses coercive measures against private citizens.\u201d\nId.  The Judge\u2019s conclusion that none of Applicant\u2019s in-laws are involved in activities that would\nmake it likely that Applicant would have to choose between their interests and those of the United\nStates is not supported by the record evidence.  Because the Judge attempted to minimize Applicant\u2019s\nwife\u2019s relationship with her mother, he did not discuss the fact that her mother has been employed\nfor almost thirty years as a switch-board operator at a Taiwanese Air Force base and is nearing\nretirement.  The Judge\u2019s application of Mitigating Condition 8(a) is not sustainable. \nDepartment Counsel also challenges the sufficiency of the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis.\nShe plausibly contends that the analysis does little but restate the factors underlying his treatment of\nthe mitigating conditions.  This argument is persuasive.  The Board notes the Judge\u2019s findings and\nrecord evidence (1) that Applicant conducted business in Taiwan and China; (2) that while conducting\nbusiness in China he used a Chinese name written in Chinese script; (3) that he is married to a citizen\nof Taiwan; (4) that his wife\u2019s parents and brother are citizens of Taiwan; and (5) that his wife\nmaintains frequent contact with her father and brother.  The Judge does not adequately explain how\nthe evidence submitted by Applicant mitigates the security concerns arising from these foreign\ncontacts, viewed in their totality.  See ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)\n(Propriety of considering a spouse\u2019s foreign citizenship in light of the record as a whole).\nAccordingly, the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis is not sustainable. \nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision granting Applicant a security clearance is REVERSED.\nSigned: Michael Y.

He earned a high school diploma and a degree in both electrical engineering and computer science from a leading U.S. university. Married, Applicant has one child who is nearly two years of age. During the summer break after his junior year in college, Applicant had a summer internship with a software company. He contributed to an independent project that caught the eye of an individual seeking technical talent to start a new company designing graphic software. By the time Applicant started his senior year of college, he was working part-time for the newly created venture.

On April 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B\n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nIn a response notarized on May 7, 2009, Applicant admitted all eight allegations\nraised in the SOR and requested a hearing. After consultation, Applicant and\nDepartment Counsel agreed to a hearing date of July 15, 2009. A Notice of Hearing to\nthat effect was issued on June 24, 2009. At the hearing, Applicant was represented by\ncounsel and introduced three documents, admitted into the record without objection as\nexhibits (Exs.) A-C. Applicant gave testimony, as did four witnesses on his behalf.\nSeptember 25, 2009\n\n The transcript incorrectly identifies the number of documents as 13.

On\nJuly 22, 2009, two additional documents were sent by facsimile transmission to\nDepartment Counsel, who forwarded the items to me on July 23, 2009. They were\naccepted into the record without objection as Exs. D-E. The transcript (Tr.) of the\nproceeding was also received on July 23, 2009. The record was closed on July 27,\n2009. Based upon a review of the case file, exhibits, and testimony, security clearance\nis granted.\nAdministrative Notice\nThe Government submitted nine documents regarding the country of Taiwan.\nThose documents note that Taiwan is a multi-party democracy. They report that the\nU.S. does not support Taiwan independence, in keeping with the \u201cone China\u201d policy.2\nThey report, however, that the U.S. supports Taiwan\u2019s membership in appropriate\ninternational organizations where statehood is not a requirement for membership and\nits meaningful participation in appropriate international organizations where its\nmembership is not possible.  \n3\nThe documents also stress that there are significant economic ties between\nTaiwan and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), attributable to their physical\nproximity and history. Because of its location, Taiwan has a particular interest in\ninformation from the U.S. that could aid it in its own defense.  The documents note that\n4\nthe PRC maintains intelligence operations in Taiwan through a bureau utilizing PRC\nnationals with Taiwanese connections.  Unlike the PRC, however, the constitutional\n5\nbasis of the Taiwanese government suggests that its resort to coercive measures\nagainst its citizens to collect economic intelligence is precluded.  \n6\n\n Ex.

Tr. 27.\n    11\n3\nDepartment Counsel cites to various cases involving the illegal export or\nattempted illegal export of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to and/or through\nTaiwan.  An additional source cited is from nearly a decade ago. It is a report to the\n7\nU.S. Congress concerning foreign economic collection and industrial espionage\noccurring in the 1990s. That report notes that Taiwan was then known to be an active\ncollector of U.S. economic intelligence.  The report ranked Taiwan after China, Japan,\n8\nIsrael, France, and Korea as an active collector of such information.  \n9\nThe proffered materials also note that Taiwan is a modern democracy with\nvibrant public participation during which demonstrations may become confrontational.\nCaution is urged within the vicinity of any political demonstrations.  Overall crime is\n10\nnoted as low. None of the documents offered by Department Counsel affirmatively\nstates or suggests Taiwan specifically targets U.S. citizens to obtain protected\ninformation or is associated with terrorism.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old advanced programmer who has worked for the same\ndefense contractor since January 2006. He earned a high school diploma and a degree\nin both electrical engineering and computer science from a leading U.S. university.\nMarried, Applicant has one child who is nearly two years of age. \nDuring the summer break after his junior year in college, Applicant had a\nsummer internship with a software company. He contributed to an independent project\nthat caught the eye of an individual seeking technical talent to start a new company\ndesigning graphic software. By the time Applicant started his senior year of college, he\nwas working part-time for the newly created venture. Upon graduation, he became a\nfull-time employee of the company, earning approximately $60,000 a year and receiving\nabout 5% of the company\u2019s equity in stock shares. When their initial funding was\ndepleted, the company received financing from another U.S. company, from which he\nreceived similar shares of stock.\nIn May 2003, Applicant made his first trip to Taiwan to promote his company\u2019s\nproducts. By spring 2004, he had moved to Taiwan to increase sales opportunities. As\npart of his efforts, trips were made to mainland China to promote his company.  While\n11\nworking in China, he followed the local business practice of using a Chinese name\n\n Tr. 27-28. W hen using his English name, Applicant did not adopt the use of Chinese characters.\n    12\n Tr. 25.\n    13\n Tr. 36.\n    14\n Tr.47.\n    15\n Tr. 56. It was further noted Applicant ceased his contact with his former place of employment shortly\n    16\nthereafter. See also Tr. 47.\n Tr. 26.\n    17\n That action was executed by letter posted on July 15, 2009. Ex. D (Attorney\u2019s letter, dated June 22, 2009)\n    18\nand Ex. E (Proof of Mailing, dated Jul. 15, 2009); Tr. 28-31, 109-110. Applicant estimates the value of the\nstock as being approximately $750 U.S. dollars. Applicant only postponed this relinquishment because he \u201chad\na distaste for dealing with the officers [of the company]. . . .\u201d Tr. 47.\n Tr. 35.\n    19\n Tr. 48.\n    20\n4\nspelled in Chinese characters. This was partly in observance of local practice, but also\nit was an acknowledgment that his unique last name was difficult to pronounce in\nChinese.  During this time abroad, the only contact Applicant had with a potential agent\n12\nof either the government of Taiwan or the government of China was a brief\ndemonstration for a public/private television station in China.  \n13\nIn 2004 or early 2005, Applicant\u2019s company was restructured and he was named\nas one of four company directors. One evening, he met his present wife at a dinner\nhosted by a co-worker. She was college educated and a successful copywriter for a\nprivate entity with no connection with any government.  They developed a relationship\n14\nand he met her parents, who divorced about 20 years ago. \nBy the summer of 2005, Applicant had become disillusioned with his employer\nand his situation. He had developed a \u201cdistaste\u201d for his dealings with the officers of the\ncompany  and wanted to \u201cbe in a healthier work environment.\u201d  He felt his stock\n15\n16\nbenefits would never become anything \u201csignificant.\u201d  Missing life in the U.S., he asked\n17\nhis future wife to go with him to America, which she did in June 2005. He returned to\nthe state in which he was raised, formally quit his position in July 2005, and was\nmarried in September 2005. Since quitting his position, he has relinquished all his\nrights, title, and interest in his company\u2019s common stock together with his stock\ncertificate.  Applicant no longer has any foreign financial ties, interests, or\n18\ninvestments.  He no longer retains any professional ties with the company, Taiwan, or\n19\nChina, although he subsequently made three trips to Taiwan. He and his wife took two\npleasure trips in 2006. A third trip was taken in March 2009, when he joined his wife\nand infant child on their visit to Taiwan which, for the most part, was planned to visit her\nfather. Each time, Applicant visited for about a week while his wife stayed for a longer\nperiod of time, usually three weeks. He expects they will continue to visit his wife\u2019s\nfamily \u201cevery couple of years\u201d while her parents remain alive.20\n\n Applicant\u2019s wife and her mother are estranged. They speak less than monthly by telephone and do not\n    21\notherwise correspond. Tr. 38-39, 65-66. Because they are not close, Applicant has only met the elder  woman\n\u201ca half-dozen times, just for a very brief period each time.\u201d Tr. 34-35.\n Tr. 67.\n    22\n Id. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law\u2019s sister has been in the U.S. for nearly 40 years and been a U.S. citizen for\n    23\nnearly 30 years. She is a former restauranteur who now owns a retail store. \n  Tr. 68.\n    24\n Taiwan does not have an equivalent to Social Security, so Applicant\u2019s father-in-law receives no state\n    25\nfunding toward his retirement. Tr. 70.\n Tr. 35.\n    26\n Tr. 73.\n    27\n Tr. 43.\n    28\n Tr. 42, 79-80.\n    29\n5\nAside from his recent trip to Taiwan, Applicant has had no contact with his wife\u2019s\nmother.  Applicant had brief contact with the woman on each of his three return visits\n21\nto Taiwan. She has worked for a Taiwanese military base for nearly 30 years as a\nswitchboard operator, although her job function has been virtually eliminated through\ntechnological advances. She will soon be eligible for retirement.\nApplicant has spent slightly more time with his wife\u2019s father, who completed his\nstate-mandated military service as an air traffic controller over 20 years ago.  The\n22\nfather retired from the military with the dream of moving to the U.S. and opening a\nrestaurant, as his sister had earlier. Instead, he ended up buying and managing a hotel\nin Taiwan.  When he severed from the military, he was given a financial settlement. No\n23\nadditional funds are or will be forthcoming for his benefit from the state.  Today, he is\n24\nretired from the hotel business and he lives off his investments.  Applicant\u2019s father-in-\n25\nlaw visited the U.S. for the birth of his grandchild. He later made another visit about six\nmonths later to see his sister and his daughter\u2019s family.  Applicant\u2019s wife and her father\n26\nexchange telephonic contact every few weeks. The contact is casual and the\nconversations last about 10 minutes at the most.  He has no future plans to visit the\n27\nU.S. Both her father\u2019s octogenarian parents are still alive, although she has only spoken\nwith her grandfather, who is in ill health, \u201ca handful of times in the last year.\u201d  \n28\nApplicant\u2019s wife also has one sibling, a brother who is about six years her junior.\nHe lives with their father and is training to become a hair stylist. His contact with\nApplicant\u2019s wife is infrequent, about on par with his wife\u2019s contact with their mother.\nThey are not particularly close. They exchange greetings about once a month, when\nthey see each other on-line.  \n29\n\n Id.\n    30\n Tr. 44.\n    31\n Tr. 80-81. These friends are female. One works for a U.S.-based jeweler and the other is a secretary. \n    32\n Tr. 73.\n    33\n Tr. 76.\n    34\n Tr. 76-77.\n    35\n  Tr. 96.\n    36\n Tr. 83.\n    37\n  Tr. 78.\n    38\n Tr. 81.\n    39\n6\nWhen Applicant and his wife visited Taiwan, they spent some time at her father\u2019s\nhome and some time at the hotel he used to manage.  Applicant and his wife also\n30\nspent some time with other relatives of his wife, but Applicant has little recollection of\nthe visit as he was unable to converse with them. Applicant\u2019s wife used to maintain\nsome contact with old school friends, but that contact ended a couple of years ago.31\nToday, she only occasionally exchanges internet messages with two particular friends\nwhen she encounters them on-line through her internet \u201cbuddy list.\u201d  Her contact with\n32\nTaiwan is otherwise limited to her parents, paternal grandfather, and brother. She has\nno contacts or connections with any government, nor does she have any property or\ninvestments in Taiwan.  As for Applicant\u2019s work, his wife has little understanding of\n33\neither his business or his projects.  She would be unable to provide details of her work\n34\nto third parties.35\nApplicant started his current job in 2006. He and his wife are settled in a mid-\nsized community, where they have owned their own home for about two years. Their\nmarital assets are in the U.S., with they have no holdings in Taiwan or China. Applicant\nis exceptionally close to his mother who, in depicting their relationship stated: \u201cI think\nI\u2019ve relied on him probably as much as he has relied on me.\u201d  They visit on a near-\n36\nweekly basis. Although Applicant learned very little Taiwanese while living abroad, his\nwife now speaks English fluently. She has made friends with their neighbors and has\nsocialized with some of Applicant\u2019s professional peers.  She does not associate with\n37\nany Taiwanese or Chinese groups or associations in the U.S. Their child attends day\ncare at a local church attended by the children of Applicant\u2019s peers. Applicant\u2019s wife\nonly recently received her permanent green card, which was delayed in arrival due to\nan address error. With the card now in her possession, she is preparing to apply for\nU.S. citizenship.  Her application for citizenship is already signed and completed,\n38\nneeding only to be mailed.  \n39\n\n Tr. 53-54.\n    40\n Tr. 57.\n    41\n Tr. 59.\n    42\n Tr. 89.\n    43\n See, e.g., Tr. 33, 51-52, 60, 96-97.\n    44\n7\nAt work, Applicant is exceptionally well regarded. His supervisor notes that\nApplicant not only knows how to properly safeguard information, but that he serves as a\nmodel for others.  That co-worker states that he has never noticed anything suspicious\n40\nabout Applicant\u2019s conduct or demeanor: \u201cI\u2019ve never had any reason to believe that\n[Applicant\u2019s] doing anything other than his job.\u201d  As an employee, he receives \u201cthe\n41\nhighest merits within [the company] that [his supervisor is] able to give him.\u201d  A co-\n42\nworker with whom Applicant and his wife socialize echoes these sentiments. He also\nnotes that he has not observed any suspicious conduct on the part of Applicant and\ndoes not have any reservations regarding Applicant\u2019s ability to hold a security\nclearance.  Applicant demonstrated an appreciation and understanding of the\n43\nappropriate steps for reporting foreign contacts, which he learned on the job and\nthrough life experience. He has both professional and personal mentors to whom he\ncan turn for advice in such matters.  \n44\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial,\nand commonsense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative\njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in\nthe SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\n\n  See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 1995).\n    45\n  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n    46\n  ISCR Case No. 93-1390 at 7-8 (App. Bd. Jan. 27, 1995).\n    47\n  Id.\n    48\n  Id.\n    49\n  Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    50\n8\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n45\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n46\n47\n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n48\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation.   The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily\n49\na determination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n50\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, AG B (Foreign Influence) is the most\npertinent to the evaluation of the facts in this case. Conditions pertaining to this\nadjudicative guideline that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying, as\nwell as those which would mitigate security concerns, are set forth and discussed in the\nappropriate sections below.\nThe concern under Guideline B is that foreign contacts and interests may be a\nsecurity concern if the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may\n\n Tr. 47; see note 10, supra.\n    51\n9\nbe manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government\nin a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any\nforeign interest. The adjudication can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\nApplicant is married to, and co-habitates with, a citizen of Taiwan. His in-laws\nremain citizens and residents of that country. Applicant and his wife have traveled to\nTaiwan on three occasions since Applicant returned to the U.S. Additionally, Applicant\nresided in Taiwan while employed in that country between 2004 and 2005. During that\ntime, he served on the board of directors of his employer, owned about $750 worth of\ncompany stock, and used a Chinese name written in Chinese characters for business\npurposes when culturally appropriate. Foreign Influence Disqualifying Condition (FI DC)\nAG \u00b6 7(b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information\u201d), AG \u00b6 7(d) (\u201csharing living quarters with a person\nor persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk\nof foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d), and FI DC AG \u00b6 7(e) (\u201ca\nsubstantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country, or in any\nforeign-owned or foreign-influenced business, which could subject the individual to\nheightened risk of foreign influence\u201d) apply. With disqualifying conditions raised, the\nburden shifts to Applicant to explain or mitigate the security concerns raised under this\nguideline.\nThe unrebutted facts presented make certain allegations raised no longer\napplicable. Applicant quit his association with his former employer and severed his\npersonal and professional relationships with its directors, for whom he maintains a\n\u201cdistaste,\u201d over four years ago.  He longer resides in Taiwan, having returned to\n51\nAmerica nearly four and a half years ago. Applicant has ceased all his former business\ndealings with Taiwan and China. Consequently, he no longer uses a Chinese name or\nany other business practices unique to those countries. Moreover, he has since\nrelinquished his stock in his former company, an investment of nominal value. In so\ndoing, he divested himself of the foreign business investments, customs, and\nassociations alleged in SOR allegations \u00b6 1.d (\u201cYou served on the board of directors of\nyour employer, [deleted], which had subsidiaries in Taiwan and China\u201d), \u00b6 1.e (\u201cYou\nresided in Taiwan while employed with [deleted], between about May 2004 and June\n2005\", \u00b6 1.f (\u201cYou used a Chinese name using Chinese characters while employed by\n[deleted]\u201d, and \u00b6 1.g (\u201cYou own about 750,000 shares of [deleted] stock worth about\n$750.00\"). \n\n See, e.g., Tr. 47, 56.\n    52\n10\nThe above facts are facts of the past and, given Applicant\u2019s demonstrated\nantipathy for his former place of employment in Taiwan and its directors,  the above-\n52\nreferenced allegations are no longer current in their applicability. Applicant\u2019s\nexplanation of his rise from college student to foreign-based company director is\ncredible, as is his explanation as to why he has since severed his connections with both\nhis former company and place of residence. Under these circumstances, Foreign\nInfluence Mitigating Conditions (FI MC) AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe nature of the relationships with\nforeign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or\nactivities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be\nplaces in a position of having to choose between the interests of the foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government, and the interests of the U.S.), \u00b6 8.b (\u201cthere is no\nconflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflicts of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d), and \u00b6 8.f (\u201cthe\nvalue or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property interests is such\nthat they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used effectively to influence,\nmanipulate, or pressure the individual\u201d) apply. Consequently, it is Applicant\u2019s\nrelationship with his wife and her family that remains at issue.\nJudging by their testimony and demeanor, Applicant and his wife are truly\ndevoted to each other. He is endeavoring to help her assimilate into this culture and their\ncommunity. She has settled into their neighborhood comfortably, learning English,\nmaintaining their home, raising their young child, and slowly making friends. Applicant\nindulges his wife in her desire to maintain contacts with her family members in Taiwan,\nbut has not developed more than a casual or superficial relationship with any of them. It\nis also clear that Applicant became disillusioned with the business culture in Taiwan and\nhis former associates. He is happily back in the U.S., where he enjoys the lifestyle and\nhis work. He is back to his roots and lives near his mother, to whom he is very close.\nWith regard to Applicant and his in-laws, FI MC AG \u00b6 8.a and \u00b6 8.b, above, as well as \u00b6\n8.c (\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it wold create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation\u201d)\napply. \nIn these cases, however, the relationship between a spouse and that spouse\u2019s\nfamily is attributed to an applicant. Here, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony and Applicant\u2019s\ndepiction of his wife indicate that her relationships with her estranged mother and\nyounger brother are relatively indifferent, on par with her relationships with the\nacquaintances she sees on her internet \u201cbuddy list.\u201d As depicted, their relationships are\ncomprised more of custom-based respect and social form than of genuine substance.\nAs for her grandparents, both Applicant and his wife acknowledge and appreciate the\nfact that both are of an advanced age, octogenarians, and in declining health. Her\noccasional contact with her grandfather is performed out of respect. As is the case with\nher mother, bother, and her few \u201cbuddy list\u201d acquaintances, there are no facts indicating\n\n11\nthat she retains a particularly close or special relationship with them, although a certain\ndegree of sentiment would be natural. This is particularly true in contrast with her overt\ndevotion to her husband, their child, and their current life in the U.S. Such facts give rise\nto FI MC AG \u00b6 8.a, \u00b6 8.b, and 8.c.\nThe situation involving Applicant\u2019s father-in-law, however, is more complex. Their\nrelationship is obviously warm and their contact regular, obviating application of FI MC\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8.b-8.c. He is a former member of the Taiwanese military, although such service\nwas compulsory. He severed his service, however, two decades ago. Since leaving the\nmilitary, Applicant\u2019s father-in-law entered the private sector as a hotelier. He is currently\nretired and subsides on his business proceeds and investments. The facts show it was\nonce his dream to immigrate to the U.S. and open a restaurant. There is no evidence\nthat he is an enemy of the U.S. or that his daughter\u2019s marriage has triggered any form of\ninquiry by governmental or other agents. There is no prohibition to his visiting either his\ndaughter or his sister in the U.S. He has no connections with any foreign governments\nand he receives no monetary supplements or benefits from Taiwan\u2019s government.\nMoreover, while Taiwan may be a collector or economic information and although the\nPRC may use operatives stationed within Taiwan, there is no indication that Taiwan\nuses coercive measures against private citizens such as Applicant\u2019s father-in-law or any\nof her contacts in Taiwan. Consequently, given Applicant\u2019s wife relationship with her\nfather, the country at issue, and his capacity as a constitutionally protected private\ncitizen within Taiwanese society, FI MC AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and this \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\nnoted above. Applicant is a highly credible, intelligent, and articulate young man who is\nobviously devoted to both his wife and to the creativity involved in his professional work.\n\n12\nHe is happily content to be back in the area in which he was raised and reunited with his\nmother after an unsatisfactory period of employment in Taiwan. He is both cordial with,\nand respectful of, his in-laws, but there appears to be no genuine warmth between them.\nLinguistic differences and geography provide as much of a divide between them as does\nhis wife\u2019s minimal contact with her family members. Their sole nexus is Applicant\u2019s wife,\nwhose preference decidedly leans toward her husband, child, and home. \nAlthough diplomatic regarding his disdain for his former employment situation, his\n\u201cdistaste\u201d for his associates and experience is apparent. Since returning to the U.S., he\nhas willingly severed all ties with his former organization and its business practices. In\ncontrast, he is happy to have returned home and built the foundation for a warm and\nstable family life within his community.  \nApplicant\u2019s wife readily immigrated to the U.S. in the prospect of marrying her\npresent husband and starting her new life in the U.S. In the process, she sacrificed a\nsuccessful career as a copywriter. She is now content with her life as a housewife and\nmother. She is slowly building a life in the house they own, where she can raise their\nchid and befriend both her neighbors and her husband\u2019s office peers. But for a delay in\nher receipt of her permanent green card, her completed application for citizenship would\nalready be posted. While she maintains respectful relations with her estranged mother,\nyounger brother, and elderly grandparents, that contact is of little more intensity than the\nminimal contact she maintains with her internet \u201cbuddies.\u201d In contrast, Applicant\u2019s wife\nmaintains a warm, but geographically distant, relationship with her father. They speak on\nthe phone regularly and he has visited them twice. Although he was a member of the\nTaiwanese military during his term of compulsory service, he left that service two\ndecades ago with a settlement that afforded him the opportunity to buy and manage a\nprivate hotel. Since receiving his settlement, he has had no monetary reliance on the\nTaiwanese government. Today, he is a retired civilian living off of private investments.\nWhile it is true Taiwan has been depicted as a leading collector of economic information,\nthere is no evidence it uses coercive measures against its own citizens to do so or that\nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law has ever been questioned about his daughter\u2019s marriage.\nWhile the threat of economic collection and industrial espionage from Taiwan\nmay be real, there is no reason to believe Taiwan would target Applicant or his wife to\nobtain protected information. Nor is there evidence supporting a suggestion that\ncoercive measures would be used against Applicant, his wife, or his in-laws or that\narbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, and correspondence is practiced by that\nstate. Even if Taiwan should suddenly start exercising such practices, Applicant\u2019s\ndeficient Chinese language skills, his wife\u2019s lack of understanding about Applicant\u2019s work\nand projects, and her family\u2019s lack of English language skills would make any discrete\nform of exploitation cumbersome at best. In sum, there is no evidence indicating\nApplicant, his wife, or either her family or contacts may be manipulated or induced in a\nmanner antithetical to the interests of the U.S. or are otherwise vulnerable to pressure or\ncoercion by Taiwan or any foreign interest. Based on these facts, I conclude it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant a security clearance. Clearance is\ngranted. \n\n13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Hoffman, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Witness (W), Personal Representative1 \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has a lengthy history of binge alcohol consumption. Since 2003, \nApplicant has been involved in several alcohol-related incidents with law enforcement or \nthe courts. He received outpatient alcohol-related treatment and attended some \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. In 2004, a clinical psychologist diagnosed him as \nalcohol dependent. He continues to consume alcohol. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 12, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) (SF-86). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On August 5, \n2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended \nand modified; and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005. \n \n1Applicant\u2019s personal representative (W) is also his fianc\u00e9 and a witness. Her name is not \nincluded for privacy reasons.  \nJuly 7, 2010\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol consumption). \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 4) The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. DOHA then \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nOn August 26, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations. (HE 4) \nApplicant did not request a hearing. Department Counsel requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. On January 8, 2010, Department Counsel announced she was \nready to proceed on Applicant\u2019s case. On January 19, 2010, DOHA assigned \nApplicant\u2019s case to me. On February 16, 2010, the case was scheduled for a hearing on \nMarch 2, 2010. (HE 2) The hearing was terminated because Applicant requested a \ndelay to consult with counsel and review documents. (Hearing transcript (Tr.) from first \nhearing) On May 6, 2010, Department Counsel and Applicant agreed that the hearing \ncould be held on June 3, 2010. (Tr. 17-18) On May 14, 2010, DOHA issued a hearing \nnotice setting the hearing for June 3, 2010. (Tr. 17; HE 2) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held \non June 3, 2010. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits (GE 1-9) (Tr. \n21-22), and Applicant offered two exhibits (Tr. 12, 23-24; AE A-B) Applicant did not \nobject to the admissibility of GE 1-9. (Tr. 21-22) Department Counsel did not object to \nmy consideration of AE A-B. (Tr. 23-24) I admitted GE 1-9 (Tr. 21-22) and AE A-B. (Tr. \n23-24) Additionally, I marked two hearing notices, the SOR, and the response to the \nSOR as HE 1-4. On June 21, 2010, I received the transcript. I held the record open until \nJune 21, 2010. (Tr. 117-118, 140) No post-hearing exhibits were received.  (HE 5) \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b to 1.f, and 1.h to 1.n. (HE 4) He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g. (HE \n4) His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a Government contractor (Tr. 76; GE 1).3 \nHis current employer has employed him for more than six years. (Tr. 77) He served in \nthe Air Force from July 1995 to April 2004. (Tr. 78; GE 1) He reached the grade of E-5; \nhowever, at the time of his discharge, he was an E-2. (Tr. 78) He married in December \n1997, and divorced in June 2002. (GE 7 at 1) He remarried his former spouse (FS) in \nFebruary 2004, and they were divorced in 2008. He has two children. He completed \nvarious computer and automation-related courses. (Tr. 76) Applicant has not attended \ncollege. (GE 1) Applicant has held a top secret clearance with access to sensitive \ncompartmented information (SCI). (Tr. 77, 99) He currently holds an interim secret \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n3Applicant\u2019s SF-86 (GE 1) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nclearance. (Tr. 77) He was never investigated or disciplined for compromising classified \ninformation. (Tr. 100)  \n \nAlcohol consumption and rehabilitation treatment \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol at times to excess to the point of intoxication and \nhad alcohol-related blackouts from approximately 1992, when he was age 16, to at least \nDecember 2008. (Tr. 73-74; SOR \u00b6 1.a; GE 2 at 2) He received an alcohol evaluation in \nabout March 2002; however, the March 2002 evaluation did not result in a diagnosis of \nalcohol abuse or dependence. (SOR \u00b6 1.b; HE 4) Applicant was in the Air Force from \nages 18 to 27. (Tr. 98) During those nine years, he said he had five alcohol-related \nincidents.4 (Tr. 98)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s April 13, 2003 driving while intoxicated offense \n \nOn April 12 and 13, 2003, while Applicant was in standby status, he consumed \nalcohol. (Tr. 94; GE 9 at 9) He went to bed at 3:00 am on April 13, 2003. (Tr. 94) Three \nhours after going to bed, he was driving to see FS, and he hit a parked tractor trailer. \n(Tr. 94; GE 7 at 1; GE 9 at 1, 4) No one was injured in the accident. (GE 7 at 1) He was \narrested and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). (SOR \u00b6 1.c; HE \n4) His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .223. (Tr. 94; GE 9 at 1) He was found guilty \nand sentenced to pay a $350 fine. (GE 7 at 2) His driver\u2019s license was suspended for \nthree months. (SOR \u00b6 1.c; GE 1 at 3; GE 7 at 2; GE 9 at 9; HE 4) He completed an \neight-hour class concerning alcohol consumption. (GE 7 at 2) In his response to a letter \nof reprimand for the DUI, he stated, \u201cI have nothing but regret for what I have done.  .  .  \n. this is an isolated incident and this will NEVER happen again.  .  .  . I want to reiterate \nthat nothing like this will ever happen again.\u201d (emphasis in original) (GE 9 at 4)  \n \nOn September 23, 2003, Applicant made a written statement to a Defense \nSecurity Service special agent. (GE 7) Applicant said he had an alcohol-consumption \nevaluation which determined he \u201cdid not have an alcohol problem.\u201d (GE 7 at 2) He \nstated, his \u201carrest for DUI in Apr 03 was an isolated incident. I would normally drink \nsocially, and very sporadically, drinking about two beers or two drinks, maybe every few \nweeks.\u201d (GE 7 at 2) He commented that since his \u201carrest in Apr 03, I no longer drink \nalcohol at all. I do not drink and drive.\u201d (GE 7 at 3) \n \nApplicant\u2019s commander determined he was derelict in the performance of his \nduties by becoming intoxicated while in standby status. (SOR \u00b6 1.d; GE 9 at 4; HE 4) \nOn May 14, 2003, his command imposed nonjudicial punishment (NJP) under Article \n15, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for this offense. (SOR \u00b6 1.d; GE 9 at 7-9; \nHE 4) His punishment included a suspended reduction in grade and forfeiture of $200 \n \n4The SOR in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j lists four alcohol-related incidents during those nine years. \nThe SOR does not include the allegation that he assaulted FS in January 2004. (GE 4 at 6) FS recanted \nher allegation of assault in January 2004 and no adverse action was taken against Applicant. (GE 4 at 6) I \nconsider the alleged January 2004 assault to be unsubstantiated. No adverse inference is made against \nApplicant for the alleged January 2004 assault of FS.    \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \npay two months; however, he completed the suspension period without vacation of the \nsuspended reduction in grade. (Tr. 100-101; GE 9 at 9) \n \nOn April 14, 2003, Applicant received an alcohol evaluation. He was diagnosed \nas having \u201cAlcohol Intoxication.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.e; GE 4 at 30, 34; HE 4) The evaluation \nnoted he had two factors weighing towards alcohol dependence: \u201cincreased tolerance\u201d \nand \u201csocial/occupational impairment as indicated by DUI.\u201d (GE 4 at 34) The evaluator \nrecommended \u201cBasic Education\u201d as a corrective remedy. (GE 4 at 35) \n \nApplicant\u2019s other alcohol-related offenses and evaluations \n \nIn October 2003, Applicant received NJP under Article 15, UCMJ, for assault. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f; HE 4) He consumed approximately four beers and part of a pitcher of beer \nbefore participating in an altercation with FS. (SOR \u00b6 1.f; GE 4 at 24; HE 4) See the \nstatement of W, infra, for extenuating information concerning altercations between \nApplicant and FS.  \n \nFrom November 2003 to January 2004, Applicant received outpatient alcohol \ntreatment for a diagnosed condition of \u201cAlcohol Abuse.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.g; GE 4 at 11-21, 28) \nThe November 4, 2003 medical report listed two established criteria for alcohol abuse: \n\u201crecurrent substance-related legal problems\u201d and \u201ccontinued use despite recurrent \nproblems caused or exacerbated by the use.\u201d (GE 4 at 28) It also listed one factor \nrelating to alcohol dependence, \u201cincreased tolerance.\u201d (GE 4 at 28) He described three \nhangovers, one blackout, passing out once, being drunk three times, \u201cbuzzed\u201d fifteen \ntimes, and binge drinking on twelve occasions in the last 12 months. (GE 4 at 26)  \n \nIn February 2004, while on an Air Force base, Applicant went outside to urinate. \n(GE 3 at 5) The security police saw him, pursued him, and apprehended him. (GE 3 at \n5) The security police alleged that he resisted apprehension. (GE 3 at 5) On February \n26, 2004, medical personnel interviewed Applicant about his alcohol consumption. He \nsaid that prior to the February 2004 incident where he allegedly resisted arrest, he \nconsumed nine alcohol drinks. (GE 4 at 6) He received a diagnosis of \u201cAlcohol \nDependence.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.i; HE 4) The February 26, 2004 medical report listed four \nestablished criteria for alcohol dependence: \u201cincreased tolerance;\u201d \u201cusing more than \nintended;\u201d \u201csocial/occupational impairment;\u201d and \u201ccontinued use despite persistent or \nrecurrent .  .  . psychological (e.g. depression/anxiety) consequences.\u201d (GE 4 at 10) The \nFebruary 26, 2004 medical report said the diagnosis \u201cdoes have a negative impact on \nthe patient\u2019s trustworthiness and reliability to properly safeguard classified information.\u201d \n(GE 4 at 10-11) This medical report was signed by an alcohol and drug abuse counselor \nand a clinical psychologist. (GE 4 at 11) In March 2004, Applicant received NJP under \nArticle 15, UCMJ, for communicating a threat, disorderly conduct, and resisting \napprehension. (SOR \u00b6 1.h; HE 4) He received a letter of reprimand and a reduction in \ngrade. (SOR \u00b6 1.h; HE 4) \n \nIn April 2004, Applicant was found sleeping on the ground near a fence. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.j; HE 4) He was charged with being drunk and disorderly. (SOR \u00b6 1.j; HE 4) In April \n2004, he received alcohol-related outpatient counseling, and he was again diagnosed \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nas \u201cAlcohol Dependent.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.k; HE 4) Applicant\u2019s commander wanted him to stay \nin the Air Force, and offered him the option of remaining in the service or accepting a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions. (Tr. 102) Applicant asked to be \ndischarged from the Air Force. (Tr. 102) In April 2004, he was discharged from the Air \nForce for a pattern of misconduct. (SOR \u00b6 1.l; HE 4) He was barred from the local \nmilitary installation, and he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l; HE 4) He explained that he did not complete the alcohol-counseling \nprogram recommended by medical personnel because he was discharged from the Air \nForce. (SOR \u00b6 1.g; Tr. 75; GE 4) When he left active service, he believed he could \ncontrol his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 97) From June 2004 to May 2006, Applicant said \nhe consumed \u201clittle to no[]\u201d alcohol. (Tr. 96) \n \nOn May 6, 2006, Applicant consumed alcohol before becoming involved in an \naltercation with FS. The police arrested him and charged him with domestic assault \n(third degree). (SOR \u00b6 1.m; GE 5 at 4, 12-13; GE 6 at 3; HE 4) He pleaded guilty to \ncriminal attempt (third degree) because he wanted to protect FS\u2019s military career. (GE 5 \nat 8) He thought her command would take adverse action against her for her \n\u201crevengeful behavior against me\u201d if she abandoned her allegation of assault (GE 5 at 8). \nHe was sentenced to six months of probation and ordered to attend AA meetings once \na week for six months. (GE 5 at 10; GE 5 at 7) The court ordered him to abstain from \nalcohol consumption and to pay court costs, fees, and fines. (GE 5 at 6-10) On March \n14, 2007, he completed all requirements ordered by the court. (GE 4 at 8; GE 5 at 10) \nOn March 21, 2007, the probation office released him from probation. (GE 5 at 9) He \nstopped consuming alcohol from May 2006 until August 2008. (Tr. 96) \n \nIn March 2009, Applicant felt stress because of problems he had with FS. (Tr. \n103) He consumed about ten drinks of alcohol, and then drove a vehicle. (Tr. 83) The \npolice arrested Applicant for DUI.5 (Tr. 83) His blood alcohol content (BAC) was a little \nabove .15. (Tr. 93) In July 2009, he pleaded guilty to DUI, and the court ordered him to \nattend ten AA meetings. (Tr. 84-85) He promised himself that he would not consume \nalcohol again. (Tr. 114) The court also ordered nine months of probation and \nsuspended his driver\u2019s license for 90 days. (Tr. 84-86) The court ordered him not to \ndrink alcohol while he was on probation, and he complied with this requirement. (Tr. 86-\n87) He passed eight urinalysis tests, which checked for alcohol consumption. (Tr. 87) \nHe did not report the March 2009 DUI to his security officer. (Tr. 86) \n \nApplicant said, \u201cI occasionally only drink to excess,\u201d and he denied that he was \nan alcoholic because he did not have physical cravings for alcohol. (Tr. 88, 112) He was \nnot physically dependent on alcohol. (Tr. 112-113) When he went to AA meetings, he \ndid not acknowledge that he is an alcoholic. (Tr. 89) Applicant\u2019s most recent attendance \nat an AA meeting was four months ago. (Tr. 81, 87) He consumed alcohol about once a \n \n5Applicant objected to having to disclose the March 2009 DUI because it was not part of the \ndiscovery materials provided to him. (Tr. 82-83) I overruled his objection; however, I held the record open \nafter his hearing to allow him to obtain and present additional mitigating information relating to his DUI \nand 2009 alcohol-related counseling. (Tr. 81) The SOR was not amended, and the March 2009 DUI will \nnot be used to establish a disqualifying condition. (Tr. 82-83) It is relevant to the whole-person concept. \nSee n. 7, infra.  \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nweek, and his alcohol consumption is on the weekends. (Tr. 98) Two weeks before his \nhearing, he drank five drinks containing alcohol. (Tr. 78)  \n \nAfter his March 2009 DUI, a medical professional (MP) evaluated his alcohol \nconsumption during his 14 weeks of counseling or treatment. (Tr. 89, 104-105) \nHowever, MP did not provide a copy of the evaluation to Applicant. (Tr. 89, 117-118) \nApplicant did not believe MP\u2019s evaluation concluded he was alcohol dependent, and he \ndid not believe he was alcohol dependent. (Tr. 90, 97, 104) MP\u2019s evaluation did say that \nApplicant had a \u201ccompulsion to drink too much on occasion.\u201d (Tr. 105) MP told Applicant \nthat Applicant did not really need the alcohol-awareness course or alcohol counseling. \n(Tr. 105) However MP did not have access to Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related \nincidents, and Applicant did not advise MP that there was a previous diagnosis of \nalcohol dependence. (Tr. 90)     \n \nApplicant continues to consume alcohol notwithstanding his 2004 diagnosis of \n\u201cAlcohol Dependence.\u201d (Tr. 78, 113-114; SOR \u00b6 1.n; HE 4) Applicant preferred to be a \nsocial drinker and to drink alcohol responsibly. (Tr. 115) He was not convinced that \nabstaining from alcohol completely was a \u201chealthy\u201d situation for him. (Tr. 115) Typically, \nApplicant drinks alcohol to excess when there is stress in his life. (Tr. 104) He did not \ndisclose information about the SOR allegations to his employer because he was \nashamed of his alcohol-related history. (Tr. 109)   \n \nW\u2019s statement  \n \nW has known Applicant and FS since June 25, 2004. (Tr. 25-26) She is a \nperiohygenist. (Tr. 42) FS has periodically called the police and made false allegations \nagainst Applicant as a method of dominating and controlling him. (Tr. 29-41) In May \n2006, FS, after consuming some alcohol, started an argument with Applicant. (Tr. 28) \nFS pushed Applicant, and he pushed her back. (Tr. 28) FS called the police, and the \npolice arrested Applicant. (Tr. 29) Applicant decided to plead guilty because he wanted \nto protect FS from getting into trouble about making false statements to the police. (Tr. \n30) \n \nIn August 2008, FS committed an unprovoked assault upon Applicant and W. (Tr. \n32, 36) W\u2019s back and neck were damaged when FS grabbed W by the hair and pulled \nher head back and forth. (Tr. 36) W was further injured when FS jumped on top of W, \ncausing W to fall to the ground and resulting is a severe cut to W\u2019s back. (Tr. 36) W was \ntaken by ambulance to a hospital. (Tr. 37) The county district attorney\u2019s office provided \ndocumentation permitting Applicant and W to register as victims. (Tr. 33-34) On \nNovember 19, 2008, W asked the district attorney to dismiss the charges against FS in \norder \u201cto cover up what [FS] did.\u201d (Tr. 34-35, 41) W and Applicant wanted the charges \nagainst FS to be dismissed because Applicant\u2019s two children needed their mother\u2019s \nsupport. (Tr. 44) FS received diversion or probation for a year. (Tr. 45) Problems \nbetween FS and W have continued with FS and W obtaining restraining orders and the \npolice questioning W. For example in April 2009, FS called the police and alleged W \nhad kidnapped her daughter, when W was actually babysitting for FS\u2019s daughter. (Tr. \n46)  \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nOn March 2, 2010, FS was present and prepared to make a statement on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf at his hearing. (Tr. 53, 55) However, FS and Applicant have a new \ndispute. (Tr. 53) FS and FS\u2019s new boyfriend wanted to take Applicant\u2019s children to a \ndifferent state; however, Applicant opposed the move. (Tr. 53) On June 3, 2010, FS was \nnot present at his hearing.    \n        \nW stated that from June 25, 2004, to May 2006, Applicant drank a couple of \ndrinks on an infrequent basis. (Tr. 37) He stopped drinking alcohol from May to August \n2008. (Tr. 38) W lives with Applicant. (Tr. 39) W observed Applicant drinking alcohol a \ncouple of weeks ago. (Tr. 47-48) W encouraged Applicant to go out and have a couple \nbeers with his friends. (Tr. 116) W consumed alcohol with Applicant and did not see a \nproblem with Applicant\u2019s continued alcohol consumption. (Tr. 48) He drinks about four \ndrinks containing alcohol, and her limit in an evening is three to four beers. (Tr. 49-50)    \n \nCharacter evidence \n \nA coworker, who has had a security clearance for 27 years, has worked with \nApplicant for six years. (Tr. 55, 60) He has never noticed an odor of alcohol on \nApplicant\u2019s person, or any other alcohol-related problems. (Tr. 56, 62) He has never \nobserved Applicant consuming alcohol. (Tr. 60-61) He was not aware of the allegations \nin the SOR or whether Applicant attended any AA meetings. (Tr. 60-61, 64) He did not \nknow of any incidents involving Applicant\u2019s compromise of classified documents or \nnational security. (Tr. 57) Applicant is a good worker with an excellent reputation as a \nworker and employee. (Tr. 57, 68) He supports reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. (Tr. 55-64) If Applicant loses his clearance, he will lose his job, and \nApplicant\u2019s children will lose their medical and dental benefits. (Tr. 64)    \n  \nApplicant\u2019s program manager (PM) has worked with Applicant since 2004. (AE A) \nPM has \u201cnever encountered a situation to question [Applicant\u2019s] integrity or \nprofessionalism,\u201d and he strives to fulfill his duties. (AE A) Applicant\u2019s work performance \nis exceptional, and he recommends reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s security clearance. (AE \nA) PM was not aware of Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 107-109) \n \nApplicant\u2019s operations manager (OM) describes Applicant\u2019s technical knowledge \nas outstanding. (AE B) Disapproval of Applicant\u2019s security clearance will \u201cresult in \ndegraded overall service to the customer.\u201d (AE B) OM is not aware of the alcohol-\nrelated allegations in the SOR. (Tr. 108-109) \n   \nApplicant contended that he should retain his security clearance because he \nwanted to continue to contribute to the national defense. (Tr. 106) He loves his country \nand wishes to continue to support the United States. (Tr. 107) \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, nothing in this \ndecision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in \npart, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication that Applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n   \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline G (alcohol consumption) with respect to the allegations set \nforth in the SOR. \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 22 provides:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(e) to 22(g) do not apply. A licensed clinical social worker did not \ndiagnose Applicant as alcohol dependent. The scope and quality of the \u201calcohol \nrehabilitation program\u201d was unclear. Applicant has not failed to comply with a court \norder not to consume alcohol. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) to 22(d) apply. In April 2003 Applicant had a DUI, while he was on \nstandby status. In November 2003, he disclosed that he had engaged in binge alcohol \ndrinking on about twelve occasions in the previous year. In February 2004, he was \ndrunk and disorderly and involved in an altercation with the Air Force special police. In \nApril 2004, he was found passed out from excessive alcohol consumption. In February \n2004, a psychologist diagnosed him with \u201cAlcohol Dependence\u201d and listed four \nestablished criteria for alcohol dependence: \u201cincreased tolerance;\u201d \u201cusing more than \nintended;\u201d \u201csocial/occupational impairment;\u201d and \u201ccontinued use despite persistent or \nrecurrent .  .  . psychological (e.g. depression/anxiety) consequences.\u201d6 In October \n2003, and May 2006, after consuming alcohol, he engaged in physical altercations with \nFS. Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of binge alcohol consumption and multiple alcohol-\nrelated incidents since 2003 establish these four disqualifying conditions.      \n \n \n6The well-respected psychiatric reference, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, \nFourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). Washington, DC, American Psychiatric Association, 2000, \nhas defined \u201calcohol dependence\u201d to be a psychiatric condition that meets the following diagnostic \ncriteria:  \n  \nA maladaptive pattern of alcohol use, leading to clinically significant impairment or \ndistress, as manifested by three (or more) of the following, occurring at any time in the \nsame 12-month period:  \n \n(1) Tolerance, as defined by either of the following: (a) a need for markedly increased \namounts of the alcohol to achieve intoxication or desired effect; or (b) markedly \ndiminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the alcohol.  \n \n(2) Withdrawal, as manifested by either of the following: (a) the characteristic withdrawal \nsyndrome from the alcohol; or (b) the same (or a closely related) alcohol is taken to \nrelieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms.  \n \n(3) The alcohol is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was \nintended.  \n \n(4) There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control alcohol use.  \n \n(5) A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the alcohol (e.g., visiting \nmultiple doctors or driving long distances), use the alcohol, or recover from its effects.  \n \n(6) Important social, occupational, or recreational activities are given up or reduced \nbecause of alcohol use.  \n \n(7) The alcohol use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent \nphysical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by \nthe alcohol (e.g., continued drinking despite recognition that an ulcer was made worse by \nalcohol consumption). \n \nAvailable at http://www.rma.gov.au/SOP/08/017.pdf. \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the Government has met its initial burden \nconcerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Four Alcohol \nConsumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g are mitigated. The alcohol evaluation Applicant \nreceived in March 2002 was favorable and not a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or \ndependence. The allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e all directly relate to his April \n2003 DUI. The three allegations are merged in the allegation into SOR \u00b6 1.c. SOR \u00b6 1.g \ndoes not constitute disqualifying conduct because he ended his alcohol-related \ncounseling when he was discharged from the Air Force. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant began consuming alcohol \nat age 16. After his first DUI in April 2003, he told his command in his response to his \nletter of reprimand that he had stopped his alcohol consumption and such an incident \nwould not recur. Applicant was involved in additional alcohol-related incidents and his \ncommand reduced him from E-5 to E-2. He was discharged from the Air Force after \nnine years of service. Although he was able to stop consuming alcohol for substantial \nperiods of time, he subsequently resumed his alcohol consumption. From April 2003 to \nMay 2006, he had four established alcohol-related incidents. He attended alcohol \nawareness classes, received alcohol counseling, and attended weekly AA meetings for \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nsix months in 2004 and for ten weeks, ending four months before his hearing. However, \nhe is not currently attending AA meetings or receiving any other ongoing alcohol-related \ncounseling or treatment. He does not fully acknowledge his alcohol-consumption \nproblems. He denies he is an alcoholic and believes he can consume alcohol \nresponsibly despite strong evidence of a compulsion to continue drinking alcohol and \nthe 2004 diagnosis of alcohol dependence. He has not received a positive prognosis \nfrom a medical professional. He has not made satisfactory progress in his alcohol \nrehabilitation program. He consumed alcohol as recently as two weeks before his \nhearing. In sum, the possibility of relapse continues to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Alcohol consumption concerns are not \nfully mitigated for the reasons stated under this guideline and in the whole-person \nconcept, infra. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nAlthough there is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance, \nthe mitigation evidence is insufficient to resolve security concerns at this time. Applicant \nhad a very stressful relationship with FS, and he used alcohol to relieve stress. He \nattended some alcohol-awareness classes, and he received some alcohol-related \ncounseling. He attended six months of weekly AA meetings in 2004 and ten weeks of \nAA meetings up to four months before his hearing. He is not on probation and his \ndriver\u2019s license is not suspended. He contributes to his company and the Department of \nDefense. There is no evidence of any disciplinary problems unrelated to his off-duty \nalcohol-consumption at his current employment. There is no evidence of any drug \nabuse, financial problems, disloyalty, or intentional violations of national security. His \ncharacter and good work performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and \nmitigation. His supervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nretain his employment after his security clearance was called into question. He provided \nwritten supportive statements from his project manager and operations manager as well \nas one coworker who made a statement at his hearing. He is an exemplary worker and \nemployee. Applicant knows the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption, and \nhe has made some efforts in the past to abstain from alcohol consumption. More \nrecently, he has attempted to drink alcohol responsibly.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial at \nthis time. Applicant has had a problem with alcohol use beginning when he was 16 \nyears old. He has consumed alcohol at times to excess, with some periods of \nabstinence, for about 17 years. In April 2003, more than three hours after he stopped \ndrinking alcohol, Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .223 after the vehicle he was \ndriving struck a parked tractor trailer. In February 2004 and April 2004, he was involved \nin alcohol-related incidents involving the police. In February 2004, an Air Force \npsychologist diagnosed him with being alcohol dependent, and he was discharged from \nthe Air Force in April 2004 after nine years of service. In May 2006, he was involved in \nan alcohol-related altercation with FS that resulted in his conviction for criminal attempt. \nIn March 2009, Applicant had his second DUI. His March 2009 DUI is considered for the \nlimited issue of whether he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation under the whole-\nperson concept.7 Even if there were no DUI in 2009, I would not support reinstatement \nof his security clearance. His medical treatment notes, admissions, and discharge \nsummaries describe his history of alcohol consumption and establishment of his alcohol \ndependency.8 I am not convinced he fully recognizes the importance of overcoming his \nalcohol problems and establishing a significant pattern of abstinence.9 \n \n7In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)).  \n \n8See Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4) and commentary explaining why statements made to \nobtain medical treatment are deemed reliable. \n \n9For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cthat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show \nmany different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse or alcohol dependence that full mitigation of security concerns is not \npossible unless there was a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol \nconsumption.10 Applicant continues to consume alcohol. His limited rehabilitative efforts \nand lack of fundamental changes in behavior are important manifestations that increase \nsecurity concerns. The likelihood of recurrence of alcohol consumption is still sufficiently \nprobable to require more time with continued abstinence. Lingering doubts remain \nconcerning his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Abstinence from \nalcohol consumption for a significant period of time is needed to provide sufficient \nassurance that he will not return to alcohol consumption. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 12968, the Directive, the Regulation, the AGs, and other \ncited references to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. For \nthe reasons stated, Applicant has not mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case, \nand he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d to 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h to 1.n: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

In 2004, he enrolled in an outpatient substance abuse program that he\nsuccessfully completed. Recently, he suffered another injury that required treatment\nwith prescription painkillers. According to the prescribing physician, he used them\nresponsibly, without relapse. Applicant has mitigated the Guideline H security concern.\nOn December 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nSeptember 24, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR on January 29, 2009, admitting all of the\nallegations, and requested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on June 11, 2009.\nOn June 23, 2009, a notice of hearing was issued scheduling the case for July 16,\n2009. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. I received five government exhibits\nand four Applicant exhibits. At the close of the hearing, I left the record open at\nApplicant\u2019s request to allow him to submit an additional exhibit. Within the time allotted,\nhe submitted another exhibit that I incorporated into the record as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.\nThe transcript was received on July 23, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 34-year-old married man with four children ranging in age from\nthree to nine. He is a licensed electrician (Tr. 20). As part of his licensing requirements,\nhe completed a four-year apprenticeship at a technical education center (Tr. 20).\nSince April 2007, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as a facilities\nestimator (Tr. 20). His duties include helping his client, a government agency, estimate\nthe projected cost of various projects to enhance its contract bid preparation efforts (Tr.\n21). According to Applicant\u2019s project manager, he displays \u201cthe highest levels of\ncompetency, integrity, and professional acumen\u201d (Exhibit B).\nOver the years, Applicant has suffered from recurrent bouts of depression,\nanxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from sexual abuse he suffered as\na child (Exhibit 2 at 7). He has been receiving treatment and undergoing counseling\nintermittently for these problems since 2001 (Id.).\nIn August 2003, Applicant suffered a serious back injury which required\nemergency room treatment (Tr. 23; Exhibit 2 at 3). The emergency room physician\nprescribed a pain-relieving medication and a muscle relaxant (Exhibit 2 at 3). A few\ndays later, Applicant was evaluated by his treating physician who continued this course\nof treatment.\nAt or about the time Applicant hurt his back, he experienced a recurrence of the\npsychological symptoms relating to his childhood sexual abuse (Exhibit 2 at 5). Because\nthe pain relievers gave him a euphoric feeling, he began using them to mask his\nfeelings of depression and anxiety (Id. at 2). Consequently, he became drug-dependent,\nincreased the dosage without his physician\u2019s knowledge, used the painkillers after his\nback problem resolved, and feigned various physical injuries so that his physician would\nprescribe more painkillers (Tr. 25, Exhibit 2 at 3).\nApplicant\u2019s prescription painkiller abuse continued from August 2003 to\nSeptember 2004 (Answer). Applicant\u2019s wife grew suspicious after she discovered\nApplicant was using painkillers that her physician had prescribed her after a surgery (Tr.\n25). She then confronted Applicant. In response, he contacted his employee assistance\nprogram and was referred to a 20-day outpatient treatment program (Id. at 4). Applicant\nalso informed his treating physician of his problem (Tr. 33).\n\n3\nWhile enrolled in the treatment program, Applicant was diagnosed with opioid\naddiction and chronic pain syndrome (Answer; Tr. 27). He received group counseling\nfour days per week, for three hours per session ( Exhibit 2 at 4). He also attended\nweekly Narcotics Anonymous meetings (Id.). Applicant successfully completed the\nprogram in November 2004 (Id. at 7).\nAfter Applicant\u2019s discharge, his treating physician prescribed him a medication to\ncounter \u201copioid withdrawal/cravings symptoms\u201d (Exhibit D - Social Worker\u2019s Evaluation).\nApplicant also underwent counseling with a social worker to address his depression\n(Id.). The social worker was aware of the relationship of Applicant\u2019s depression to the\nissue of his painkiller abuse (Id.). Currently, Applicant\u2019s symptoms of depression are\n\u201cmuch more muted, if not resolved\u201d (Exhibit D).\nApplicant used marijuana twice in 2006 (Tr. 27). Before then, he had not used it\nsince high school (Tr. 43). Both episodes occurred at his home when out-of-town friends\nwere visiting (Tr. 28). Applicant disclosed the marijuana use to his therapist (Tr. 56). He\nhas not used any marijuana since 2006 and he no longer associates with friends who\nuse marijuana (Tr. 53). \nIn July 2008, Applicant underwent surgery for a dislocated shoulder (Tr. 38). His\ntreating physician again prescribed prescription painkillers as part of the healing process\n(Exhibit A - Physician\u2019s Statement). According to his physician, he was \u201cvery compliant,\nand even pro-active, in effective and prompt tapering of his opioid analgesics\u201d (Id.).\nApplicant discontinued the use of the prescription painkillers in approximately February\n2009 consistent with the pain management program his physician developed (Tr. 40).\nApplicant\u2019s physician is \u201cconfident in [Applicant\u2019s] ability to properly utilize opioid\nmedicine without abuse or misuse\u201d (Exhibit A).\nApplicant no longer attends support group meetings as much as he did earlier\n(Tr. 35). He remains in contact with friends who he met while in treatment, and they\n\u201chelp each other through support\u201d (Id.). On July 17, 2009, Applicant executed a signed,\nstatement of intent not to abuse drugs in the future (Exhibit E).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\n\n4\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nUnder this guideline, \u201cuse of an illegal drug or a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations\u201d (AG \u00b6 24). Applicant\u2019s prescription drug\nabuse led to a diagnosis of opioid addiction. Approximately two years later, he used\nmarijuana on two occasions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d and 25(d), \u201cdiagnosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist)\nof drug abuse or drug dependence,\u201d apply.\nApplicant did not begin using prescription painkillers for recreational purposes.\nInstead, a physician prescribed them after he injured his back. At or about the same\ntime, he experienced a recurrence of psychological symptoms related to childhood\nsexual abuse, which he discovered he could alleviate by using the prescription\npainkillers in a manner that his physician did not prescribe. With his wife\u2019s help, he\nacknowledged his addiction and enrolled in a drug treatment program that he\nsuccessfully completed. His physician provided a favorable prognosis, and his social\nworker, who counseled him with issues involving the childhood trauma, stated that the\npsychological symptoms that provoked the prescription painkiller abuse are under\ncontrol. Most importantly, Applicant recently suffered another injury that required\ntreatment with prescription painkillers, and used them responsibly, without relapse.\nI was concerned with Applicant\u2019s decision to smoke marijuana after receiving\ntreatment for prescription painkiller abuse. His use of marijuana, however, was limited to\ntwo occasions approximately three years ago. He no longer associates with his friends\nwho used the marijuana with him, and he provided a signed statement of intent not to\nabuse any drugs in the future. Approximately two years after Applicant\u2019s marijuana use,\nhe experienced another medical problem that required treatment with, among other\n\nAG \u00b6 25(b)(2) is not relevant.\n1\n5\nthings, prescription painkillers. Applicant used them, as prescribed, without a recurrence\nof abuse.\nI conclude the following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 25(b) - a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\nsuch as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are used;1\n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for and violation.\nAG \u00b6 25(c) - abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged\nillness during which these drugs were prescribed, and the abuse has since\nended.\nAG \u00b6 25(d) - satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment\nprogram, including but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare\nrequirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified medical professional.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s prescription drug addiction developed when he discovered that the\nmedication also masked the feelings of recurrent depression and anxiety he periodically\nexperienced related to childhood sexual abuse. He successfully completed therapy for\nthe prescription drug abuse through outpatient drug treatment and successfully\naddressed the psychological symptoms through counseling. His last use of marijuana\n\n6\noccurred five months before he began his current job. The negative security inference\ngenerated by his two-time marijuana use is outweighed by the time that has elapsed\nsince the last usage, and Applicant\u2019s responsible use of painkillers that a physician\nprescribed approximately two years after the last episode of marijuana use. Upon\nevaluating this case in the context of the whole person concept, I conclude Applicant\nhas mitigated the drug involvement security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact2 In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the 13 debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.g, 1.i to 1.k, 1.m, and 1.r to 1.u, totaling $14,670 (Item 2). He denied the remainder of the delinquent debts (Item 2). He admitted the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a, and denied the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.b (Item 2). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 In 1990, he graduated from high school. From March 2000 to February 2004 and from March 2004 to November 2006, he worked for defense contractors in the area of information technology. He was unemployed from December 2006 to September 2007. In October 2007, he began working for a defense contractor in the area of information technology. In 1994, he married his spouse. His twin daughters were born in 2001, and his stepson was born in 1993. He has never served in the U.S. military. Applicant did not disclose any unpaid judgments, unpaid liens, garnishments, illegal drug use, or alcohol-related offenses on his March 28, 2008, security clearance application. He disclosed an arrest for theft in November 2007, and a delinquent student loan for $2,500 that was incurred in approximately July 2004.

The two criminal offenses are mitigated. He failed \nto make sufficient effort to resolve his delinquent debts. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 28, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Item 4). \nOn June 9, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued an SOR \nto Applicant, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nWithin Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended and modified; and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005.  \n \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines F (financial considerations) \nand J (criminal conduct) (Item 1). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make \nJanuary 14, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthe preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked (Item 1). \n \nOn July 8, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated September 16, 2009, was provided \nto him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not provide a response to the \nFORM. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2010. \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the 13 debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to \n1.g, 1.i to 1.k, 1.m, and 1.r to 1.u, totaling $14,670 (Item 2). He denied the remainder of \nthe delinquent debts (Item 2). He admitted the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.a, and \ndenied the criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 2.b (Item 2). His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor.3 In 1990, he \ngraduated from high school. From March 2000 to February 2004 and from March 2004 \nto November 2006, he worked for defense contractors in the area of information \ntechnology. He was unemployed from December 2006 to September 2007. In October \n2007, he began working for a defense contractor in the area of information technology. \nIn 1994, he married his spouse. His twin daughters were born in 2001, and his stepson \nwas born in 1993. He has never served in the U.S. military.  \n \nApplicant did not disclose any unpaid judgments, unpaid liens, garnishments, \nillegal drug use, or alcohol-related offenses on his March 28, 2008, security clearance \napplication. He disclosed an arrest for theft in November 2007, and a delinquent student \nloan for $2,500 that was incurred in approximately July 2004.    \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR listed 21 delinquent debts totaling $19,859 as follows: \u00b6 1.a \n(store debt\u2014$76); \u00b6 1.b (store debt\u2014$84); \u00b6 1.c (collection account\u2014$529); \u00b6 1.d \n \n1The DOHA transmittal letter is dated September 18, 2009; and Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated \nOctober 14, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to \nsubmit information. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n  \n3Unless stated otherwise, the facts in this paragraph and the next paragraph are from Applicant\u2019s \nMarch 28, 2008, security clearance application (Item 4). \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \n(collection account\u2014$268); \u00b6 1.e (collection account\u2014$152); \u00b6 1.f (medical debt\u2014$51); \n\u00b6 1.g (collection account\u2014$196); \u00b6 1.h (medical debt\u2014$20); \u00b6 1.i (collection account\u2014\n$218); \u00b6 1.j (bank account\u2014$569); \u00b6 1.k (collection account\u2014$2,348); \u00b6 1.l (collection \naccount\u2014$616); \u00b6 1.m (collection account\u2014$8,513); \u00b6 1.n (medical debt\u2014$2,956); \u00b6 \n1.o (collection account\u2014$1,135); \u00b6 1.p (collection account\u2014$218); \u00b6 1.q (collection \naccount\u2014$84); \u00b6 1.r (collection account\u2014$200); \u00b6 1.s (collection account\u2014$1,156); \u00b6 \n1.t (collection account\u2014$120); and \u00b6 1.u (collection account\u2014$350) (Item 1). SOR \u00b6 1.v \nalso alleges Applicant was arrested in about November 2006 and charged with uttering \nworthless checks (Item 1).  \n \nApplicant said he opened three student loans in the 2002 to 2003 timeframe.4 \nThe accounts became delinquent in 2003 for about six months. He continued making \npayments until 2007, when his student loan account again became delinquent because \nof his unemployment. He paid off the $4,900 balance in April 2008 using an income tax \nrefund. He was employed from October 2007 to the present (Item 4). By January 2009, \nhe said he had paid off about $1,000 in non-student loan debts (Item 5). In January \n2009, he said he believed he could pay off all of his debts in the next 24 months (Item \n5).  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($76) and 1.j ($569)\u2014UNRESOLVED. DOHA did not ask Applicant \nto address these two debts in their interrogatories (Item 5). In his SOR response, he \nadmitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j and denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Item 4). He did not \nprovide proof of any payments or other resolution of either of these two debts.  The debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.j is established as a delinquent debt, and the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is not \nestablished. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($84)\u2014UNRESOLVED. On January 8, 2009, Applicant admitted this \ndebt resulted from a check Applicant\u2019s father wrote to him as payee (Item 5). He did not \nindicate he paid for the bad check, and he denied the debt in his SOR response (Item \n4). There is insufficient evidence to establish Applicant\u2019s responsibility for this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($529), 1.g ($196), 1.i ($218), 1.p ($218), and 1.q ($84)\u2014\nUNRESOLVED. These five debts are owed to the same creditor. On January 8, 2009, \nApplicant said he had not paid anything on these \u201cfour\u201d accounts because he could not \nafford to make payments (Item 5). In his SOR response he admitted the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.g, and 1.i, and denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p and 1.q (Item 4). He did not \nprovide any evidence of attempts to resolve these debts. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \n($529), 1.g ($196), 1.i ($218), and 1.q ($84) are established as Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.p ($218) duplicates the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. \n \n4Applicant\u2019s Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview on May 22, 2008 (Item 6) is the \nsource for the information in this section, unless stated otherwise. However, his March 28, 2008, security \nclearance application is inconsistent with his OPM interview. His security clearance application indicated \nhe incurred a $2,500 student loan in approximately July 2004 (Item 4). According to his security clearance \napplication, this was his only delinquent debt meeting the report requirements of being 180-days \ndelinquent in the last seven years, or 90-days currently delinquent (Item 4). The SOR did not allege that \nApplicant falsified his security clearance application, and I apply no adverse inference against Applicant \nbecause of omissions on his security clearance application.  \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($268), 1.e ($152), 1.f ($51), 1.h ($20), 1.l ($616/$708), and 1.n \n($2,956)\u2014UNRESOLVED. On January 8, 2009, Applicant said he did not remember \nthese accounts, and requested a credit report to validate them (Item 5). In his SOR \nresponse he admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f; and he denied the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.l and 1.n (Item 4). He did not provide any evidence of attempts to \ndispute, pay, or otherwise resolve these debts. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f \nare established as Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.l and 1.n \nare not established as Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($2,348)\u2014UNRESOLVED. On January 8, 2009, Applicant said he \nhad paid $50 a month for the last year, and the current balance was $1,950 (Item 5). He \nadmitted the debt in his SOR response (Item 4). However, he did not provide \ndocumentary proof of any payments made in the last two years, such as an account \nstatement from the creditor or his bank account statements. There is insufficient \nevidence of an established payment plan because of the absence of such readily \navailable supporting documentation.    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($8,513)\u2014UNRESOLVED. On January 8, 2009, Applicant said this \ndebt resulted from a repossessed vehicle, and the current balance was $7,151 (Item 5). \nHe admitted the debt in his SOR response (Item 4). He did not provide proof of any \npayments made in the last two years, such as an account statement from the creditor or \nhis bank account statements. However, he did list $100 monthly payments to his \ncreditor on his personal financial statement (PFS) (Item 5). There is insufficient \nevidence of an established payment plan because of the absence of such readily \navailable supporting documentation.    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.o ($1,135)\u2014UNRESOLVED. On January 8, 2009, Applicant said this \ndebt resulted from his father\u2019s checking account (Item 5). His father died and Applicant \nwas listed as the payee on the account (Item 5). He said he disputed the debt with the \ncredit reporting company (Item 5). He denied the debt in his SOR response (Item 4). He \ndid not provide proof of any payments made, or documents showing the dispute.5  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r ($200), 1.s ($1,156), 1.t ($120), and 1.u ($350)\u2014UNRESOLVED. \nThese four debts are owed to the same creditor. On January 8, 2009, Applicant said he \nhad not paid anything on these four accounts because he could not afford to make \npayments (Item 5). In his SOR response he admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r to 1.u. \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r to 1.u are established as Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. He did \nnot provide any evidence of attempts to resolve these debts.   \n \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s net monthly pay is about $2,658 (Item 5). His monthly \nexpenses are about $1,500. His PFS indicates the following monthly payments: $600 \n(mortgage), $200 (vehicle loan), and $100 (SOR \u00b6 1.m), leaving about $258 a month to \naddress his other debts (Item 5). (Applicant told the OPM investigator on May 28, 2008, \n \n5 Presumably, Applicant inherited the account from his father, and the account was overdrawn. \nThere is insufficient evidence of record to establish his responsibility for this debt. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthat he was making $200 a month payments on the SOR \u00b6 1.m account, which had a \nbalance of about $4,500). Applicant did not provide any documents showing his \ncommunications with his SOR creditors concerning his efforts to pay, establish payment \nplans, or otherwise resolve his delinquent SOR debts.6    \n \nCriminal Conduct7 \n \nApplicant admitted he was charged with theft of a motor vehicle in November \n2006 (SOR \u00b6 2.a; Item 1; Item 5, Item 6). Applicant left his used vehicle at a car \ndealership and took the dealership vehicle to his residence. The dealership called the \npolice. The next day, the police arrested Applicant at his home, and Applicant was held \nin jail for five days pending payment of his bond. The prosecutor agreed to defer \nadjudication for one year, and after the year elapsed, the charge was dismissed.   \n \nApplicant told an OPM investigator he was charged in 1999 or 2000 with writing a \nworthless check (SOR \u00b6 2.b). He received a fine of about $150. He denied to the OPM \ninvestigator and in his SOR response that he had an arrest for writing worthless checks \nin November 2006. An FBI records check indicated he was charged in November 2006 \nwith writing worthless checks; however, the FBI record does not include a disposition for \neither of the criminal offenses (Item 10). The FBI record includes the caveat that \ndeciding officials \u201cshould not deny the license or employment based on the information \nin the record until the applicant has been afforded a reasonable time to correct or \ncomplete the information  .  .  .  .\u201d (Item 10).  Additionally, the FBI record form warns \nabout relying on an arrest report, when there is no conviction (Item 10).    \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \n \n6The FORM at pages 5-6 provides additional notice to Applicant of the importance of \ndocumentation showing Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent SOR debts.  \n \n7Applicant\u2019s OPM interview on May 22, 2008 (Item 6) is the source for the information in this \nsection, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

At that point, the burden shifts to applicant to establish \neither that [he or] she is not responsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010) (internal citation omitted). \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in his credit reports, his OPM \ninterview, his response to DOHA interrogatories, and his SOR response. His debts, \nincluding several student loans, have been delinquent for a substantial period of time. In \nApplicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted the 13 debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c to 1.g, 1.i to \n1.k, 1.m, and 1.r to 1.u, totaling $14,670. In his response to interrogatories, he admitted \nresponsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($218) and 1.p ($218). I conclude these two \ndebts are  duplications of each other. \n \nAlthough Applicant said he made $50 monthly payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.k, and his PFS indicates he planned to or did make $100 monthly payments on the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, he did not provide any supporting documentary evidence of such \npayments, such as an account statement from the creditor or his bank account \nstatements. There is insufficient evidence of an established payment plan because of \nthe absence of such readily available supporting documentation. Even after he was \nadvised of the necessity of corroborating documentation in the FORM, he did not \nprovide documents showing payments to either of these creditors. \n       \nApplicant did not provide any evidence of resolution on the other 11 SOR debts. \nThe government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions.   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of any mitigating conditions \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. His delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal \nBoard\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) \n(citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant does not receive \ncredit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because he did not establish that his financial problems \n\u201coccurred under such circumstances that [they are] unlikely to recur.\u201d There is some \nresidual doubt about whether Applicant is fully committed to resolving his delinquent \nSOR debts and is making adequate steps to do so.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. Applicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by \nunemployment from December 2006 to September 2007. However, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence to establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to his unresolved SOR debts. On May 22, 2008, Applicant told an OPM \ninvestigator that he used his tax refund to pay off his student loan debt of about $4,900. \nIn January 2009, he responded to DOHA interrogatories and explained he had paid his \nstudent loans and $1,000 in debt, and predicted that he would pay off the remainder of \nhis delinquent debt in 24 months. According to his PFS, he had sufficient financial \nresources to make $100 monthly payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, with a remainder \nof $258 per month. He had sufficient financial resources to begin a payment plan to \naddress some of his smaller debts and loans, and chose not to do so.8  \n \n8\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Although Applicant did not receive financial \ncounseling, he probably has otherwise learned about financial issues. He generated a \nbudget as part of his PFS. Applicant cannot receive full credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) \nbecause he has not paid, started payment plans, disputed, or otherwise resolved at \nleast 11 of his SOR debts. There are some initial, positive \u201cindications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control.\u201d He has admitted his responsibility for 13 SOR \ndebts. Although he may have payment plans on two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.m), he did \nnot provide documentation showing any payments to these two creditors. He promised \nto eventually resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He also established some mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 20(d) because he showed some good faith9 in the resolution of his SOR \ndebts by admitting responsibility for 13 of his SOR debts, payment of his delinquent \nstudent loans in early 2008, and promising to resolve his delinquent SOR debts.  \n \nIn January 2009, Applicant questioned his responsibility for multiple SOR debts, \nand said he would contact credit reporting companies for verification. In his SOR \nresponse, he admitted responsibility for 13 of his delinquent SOR debts, and denied \nresponsibility for eight SOR debts. In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he admitted \nresponsibility for one more SOR debt. I conclude the seven SOR debts he consistently \ndenied are not sufficiently established as his responsibility, and find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d in \nthe Formal Findings on page 13, infra.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts \nsooner to resolve his delinquent SOR debts. He said he has payment plans on the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.m; however, there is insufficient supporting documentation to \ncredit him with mitigating these two substantial debts. In his SOR response, he \ncontested his responsibility for eight debts. In his DOHA interrogatories, he admitted \nmore debts than he did in his SOR response. Two debts apparently duplicate each \nother (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($200) and 1.p ($200)). He has had steady employment since \nOctober 2007, and he has not shown significant progress on his SOR debts since his \nMay 22, 2008, OPM interview. His steps since May 22, 2008, are simply inadequate to \nfully mitigate financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nwhether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the trustworthiness concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable \nconditions;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program; and \n \n(f) conviction in a Federal or State court, including a court-martial of a \ncrime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term exceeding one year and \nincarcerated as a result of that sentence for not less than a year.  \n \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(c) apply. There is substantial evidence of one felony-level \noffense. Applicant was charged with theft of a motor vehicle in November 2006 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). There is also substantial evidence of one misdemeanor-level offense. In 1999 or \n2000, he was charged with writing a worthless check (SOR \u00b6 2.b).10 The theft of the \nmotor vehicle offense was dismissed. He was convicted of the worthless check offense \nand fined about $150. He denied the felony-level offense.    \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could potentially mitigate trustworthiness \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n10He denied to the OPM investigator and in his SOR response that he had an arrest for writing \nworthless checks in November 2006. \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) applies to the worthless check offense in 1999 or 2000. It occurred \napproximately nine years ago. AG \u00b6 32(c) applies to the vehicle theft. He took a \ndealership vehicle home with him overnight, and left his vehicle behind. Taking the \nvehicle home without being absolutely sure he had permission showed poor judgment; \nhowever, the charge was dismissed about a year after he was arrested. Applicant's last \noffense resulting in a conviction occurred in 1999 or 2000. It was a misdemeanor. He \ndemonstrated his intent not to commit future crimes as encompassed in these two \nmitigating conditions. He has worked with information technology and has a good \nemployment record. He accepted responsibility and admitted his culpability. He has \nshown sufficient mitigation to mitigate criminal conduct concerns.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n  \nAlthough the rationale for reinstating Applicant\u2019s clearance is insufficient to \nsupport a security clearance at this time, there are several factors tending to support \napproval of his clearance. Applicant is 37 years old, and he is sufficiently mature to \nunderstand and abide with his security responsibilities. He deserves substantial credit \nfor volunteering to support the Department of Defense as an employee of a defense \ncontractor. There is no evidence that he has ever violated security rules. There is every \nindication that he is loyal to the United States, the Department of Defense, and his \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nemployer. There is no evidence that he abuses alcohol or uses illegal drugs. He has \nnever been fired from a job or left employment under adverse circumstances. His \nunemployment from December 2006 to September 2007 contributed to his financial \nwoes. Although he did not provide any proof from creditors or his own account \nstatements, I accept his statement that in 2008, he paid his delinquent student loan of \nabout $4,900 and about $1000 towards some other debts. These factors show some \nresponsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. \n \nThe whole person factors against reinstatement of Applicant\u2019s clearance are \nmore substantial at this time. Failure to pay or resolve his just debts is not prudent or \nresponsible. Applicant has a history of financial problems. He began to have financial \ndifficulties several years ago during a period of unemployment. On May 22, 2008, in his \nOPM interview, in January 2009, in his response to DOHA interrogatories, and in July \n2009, in his SOR response, he discussed his SOR debts. He had ample notice of his \ndelinquent SOR debts, and sufficient opportunity to contact his creditors. He did not \nmake sufficient progress in the resolution of his SOR debts. He did not pay, start \npayments, dispute, or otherwise resolve 13 SOR debts. His PFS shows a monthly \npayment of $100 towards the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m, and he said in his DOHA \ninterrogatories that he was making $50 monthly payments towards the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.k. I do not accept his statements about making or intending to make payments on the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.m as sufficient to show he has an established payment plan \non these two debts. In January 2009, he said he had sufficient income to pay all of his \nSOR debts in 24 months; however, he did not provide documentary evidence of any \npayments after January 2009 on any of his SOR debts.   \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant made insufficient progress to resolve his delinquent SOR \ndebts, even though he had steady employment since October 2007 and ample \nopportunity to contact his SOR creditors and provide documentation. He was on clear \nnotice from his receipt of DOHA interrogatories, and even more so after he received the \nSOR, that he needed to show substantial progress in the resolution of his delinquent \nSOR debts; however, he did not provide documentation showing his efforts to \naccomplish this security responsibility.    \n   \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated \nthe criminal conduct concerns; however, he has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. I take this position based on the law, as set forth in \nDepartment of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the \nwhole person factors and supporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors \nunder the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the \nGuidelines. Applicant has failed to mitigate or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i to 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n and 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant (duplicates 1.i) \nSubparagraphs 1.q to 1.u: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \n FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a federal contractor. An \u201cintegration technician,\u201d he refurbishes shelters used by the U.S. armed forces during deployment. This is his first application for a security clearance. Applicant has a history of cocaine abuse. He began using cocaine in about 2001 and continued until January 2008. His drug problem came to the attention of authorities when prenatal testing showed cocaine use by Applicant\u2019s wife and when both wife and child tested positive for cocaine after delivery. A subsequent child also tested positive for cocaine. Applicant and his wife lost custody of their children, regaining it only after having complied with court orders, including a requirement for drug abuse treatment. Applicant began outpatient treatment in December 2007. He tested positive for cocaine use three times in December and three times in January 2008.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nFulton S. Hamilton, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On September 17, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On June 14, 2010, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Michael H. Leonard denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\n1The Judge made favorable findings for all of the Guideline G allegations.  Accordingly, they are not at issue\nin this appeal.  \n2Decision at 4.  See Government Exhibit (GE) 1, SCA, at 24: \u201cIn January 2008, I admitted myself into, and\nsuccessfully graduated from, a resident rehabilitation program at [facility] to help me understand how to maintain a\nhealthy lifestyle.  I was not taking when I entered and had been clean for about 3 months.\u201d  The SCA required Applicant\nto provide the dates upon which he began and ended his drug use.  Applicant responded, \u201c04/2002 (estimated) to\n06/2007.\u201d \n3\u201cHis failure to give full, frank, and candid answers about his cocaine use and his lack of credibility in his\nhearing testimony undermine his evidence of reform and rehabilitation.  It does so because honesty and willingness to\nself-report are key factors or considerations in this regard.  An individual, like Applicant, who is dishonest with himself\nor others about the full extent of his drug abuse is not a rehabilitation success.  Given these circumstances, a longer\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due process\nand whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.1  Consistent with the following discussion, we affirm the decision of the Judge.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is an employee of a\nfederal contractor.  An \u201cintegration technician,\u201d he refurbishes shelters used by the U.S. armed\nforces during deployment.  This is his first application for a security clearance.\nApplicant has a history of cocaine abuse.  He began using cocaine in about 2001 and\ncontinued until January 2008.  His drug problem came to the attention of authorities when prenatal\ntesting showed cocaine use by Applicant\u2019s wife and when both wife and child tested positive for\ncocaine after delivery.  A subsequent child also tested positive for cocaine.  Applicant and his wife\nlost custody of their children, regaining it only after having complied with court orders, including\na requirement for drug abuse treatment.  \nApplicant began outpatient treatment in December 2007.  He tested positive for cocaine use\nthree times in December and three times in January 2008.  By mid-January Applicant acknowledged\nthat he was using cocaine every day and that he required inpatient care.  Accordingly, he entered an\ninpatient program on January 28, 2008, and completed it on February 25, 2008.  He continued with\nhis outpatient care as well, completing that in May 2008.  \nIn completing his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant stated that, during the\nprevious seven years, he had used cocaine fifty times.  He also stated on the SCA that, at the time\nhe began inpatient treatment, he had not used cocaine for three months.2  \nThe Judge found that Applicant had deliberately minimized both the duration and frequency\nof his cocaine use.  He also found that Applicant\u2019s efforts to reconcile his SCA answers with other\nevidence in the record were not credible.  \nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge noted Applicant\u2019s progress in renouncing\nhis drug habit and remaining drug free.  However, the Judge also concluded that Applicant\u2019s\ninconsistent statements about his drug use, and the perceived insufficiency of his explanations for\nthe inconsistencies, impaired his efforts to demonstrate rehabilitation.3  Therefore, the Judge\n\nperiod of abstinence from cocaine use is prudent and sensible before a safe predictive judgment can be made about\nApplicant\u2019s suitability or fitness to hold a security clearance.\u201d  Decision at 8.  \n4\u201cClient came in today to discuss his failure to process his relapses.  Client would deny use and was discharged\nas a result.  Client came in and admitted to everyday use . . . Client said he needs inpatient very bad and will do anything\nto get into inpatient as soon as possible.\u201d  This document, along with other evidence in the record, supports the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that, on his SCA, Applicant understated the number of times he had used cocaine.  \nconcluded that Applicant had not succeeded in mitigating the security concerns arising from his drug\nabuse.\nApplicant contends that the Judge\u2019s use of his SCA answers and his testimony deprive him\nof due process.  In essence, Applicant argues that the Judge denied him a clearance because of\nsecurity concerns arising from his false or misleading statements without having amended the SOR,\nin accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.  He contends that he was denied a meaningful opportunity\nto counter this evidence.  In any event, Applicant contends that the record evidence does not support\na conclusion that Applicant\u2019s false statements render him unfit for a clearance.\nWe find no reason to believe Applicant was denied due process.  The inconsistent statements\nabout which Department Counsel cross-examined Applicant were contained in Government exhibits\nprovided to Applicant prior to the hearing.  As previously noted, Applicant advised in his SCA that\nhe had used cocaine fifty times and that he had ended this use in June 2007.  On the other hand, GE\n3 at 5, a record of Applicant\u2019s outpatient treatment, reflects that Applicant was engaging in daily\ncocaine use into mid-January 2008.4  Therefore, the record evidence supplied to Applicant prior to\nthe hearing placed him on notice, first, of the existence of a six to seven-month variance among his\nstatements as to the extent of his use of cocaine and, second, of evidence suggesting that he had used\ncocaine more frequently than he had claimed in the SCA.  It was reasonably foreseeable that these\nstatements would be discussed at the hearing.  Admittedly, the cross examination questions were at\ntimes confusing.  However, the record viewed as a whole provides no basis to disturb the Judge\u2019s\nconclusion that Applicant\u2019s answers diminished his credibility and undercut his evidence in\nmitigation.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1 (\u201c[T]he Appeal Board shall give deference to the credibility\ndeterminations of the Administrative Judge.\u201d)\nFurthermore, we find no error with the manner in which the Judge treated evidence of\nApplicant\u2019s misleading statements.  Even without amending an SOR, a Judge may nevertheless\nconsider unalleged conduct for certain limited purposes.  These include assessing an applicant\u2019s\ncredibility, evaluating his evidence in mitigation, and considering the extent to which an applicant\nhas demonstrated rehabilitation.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).\nThe record reflects that the Judge examined Applicant\u2019s statements in the proper context.  See, e.g.,\nNote 3.  Contrary to Applicant\u2019s assertions, the Judge did not deny him a clearance because of\nsecurity concerns not alleged in the SOR.  Rather, he considered the totality of the evidence,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s prior statements and hearing testimony, in making a reasonable determination\nthat Applicant had failed to meet his burden of persuasion under the standard set forth in Department\nof the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be\ngranted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d)\n\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the Judge examined the relevant data and\narticulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the\nfacts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Hamilton, Esq.   \n                     \n           \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. The record evidence\nshows Applicant has a history of drug abuse (cocaine) from about 2001 through about\nJanuary 2008. He then completed outpatient and inpatient treatment where he received\na primary diagnosis of cocaine dependence and a secondary diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence, although it appears alcohol was never a serious problem for Applicant. He\nhas abstained from cocaine since approximately February 2008, obtained full-time\nemployment, and has a support system in place. He did not give full, frank, and candid\nanswers to questions about his cocaine use in May 2008, when he completed a security\nclearance application. Likewise, his hearing testimony made in an effort to justify his\nanswers was not credible. His lack of credibility undermines his evidence of reform and\nrehabilitation. Accordingly, as explained in further detail below, this case is decided\nagainst Applicant.\nJune 14, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (AG), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case.  The AG\nwere published in the Federal Register and codified in 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154, Appendix H (2006). The AG replace\nthe guidelines in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.   \n Exhibit G.  \n2\n Exhibit E. \n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on September 17,\n1\n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guidelines\nknown as Guideline H for drug involvement and Guideline G for alcohol consumption.\nThe SOR also recommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge to\ndecide whether to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me November 17, 2009. The hearing took place February 2,\n2010. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received February 12, 2010. \nThe record was kept open until February 17, 2010, to allow Applicant to submit\nadditional documentary evidence. He did so in a timely manner, and the petition and\nseries of court orders are admitted without objections.   \n2\nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He married in 2007,\nand he and his spouse have two children, a son born in 2006 and a daughter born in\n2007. He has been employed as an integration technician since May 2008. His job\ninvolves refurbishing shelters used by our Armed Forces when they are deployed. He\nreceived a \u201cmeets expectations\u201d performance review for his initial annual performance\nreview.  Before this job, Applicant was self-employed during 1996 to 2008, when he\n3\nowned and operated a tree trimming business. He is seeking to obtain a security\nclearance for the first time.  \n\n Exhibits 1\u20134. \n4\n Exhibit G. \n5\n Exhibit G. \n6\n Exhibit A. \n7\n Exhibit 3. \n8\n Exhibit 3 at 5. \n9\n Exhibit 4. \n10\n Exhibit 3. \n11\n3\nApplicant has a history of drug abuse (cocaine) from about 2001 through about\nJanuary 2008.  His drug abuse came to the attention of local authorities after the birth of\n4\nhis son in December 2006, when drug testing indicated prenatal cocaine use by the\nmother, and both the child and mother tested positive for cocaine at the child\u2019s birth.5\nTheir daughter was born in December 2007 with the same problem. As a result,\nApplicant and his wife lost legal custody of both children. They regained legal custody in\nOctober 2008, after going through a phased or transition process determined by the\njuvenile court in a series of court orders. \nTo cite one example, in its December 2007 order,  the court stated that Applicant\n6\nand his spouse tested positive for cocaine and both acknowledged recent use of\ncocaine. The court found Applicant in contempt of court for using cocaine. Also, the\ncourt ordered Applicant (and his wife) to enroll in and begin participation in a drug-\ntreatment program. That was not the only instance of Applicant testing positive. He\ntested positive for cocaine in January 2007, twice in November 2007, three times in\nDecember 2007, and three times in January 2008.  \n7\nApplicant began the court-ordered drug-treatment program as an outpatient in\nearly December 2007.  By mid-January 2008, Applicant admitted he was not processing\n8\nhis relapses, he acknowledged everyday use of cocaine, and he expressed a strong\ndesire for inpatient treatment.  \n9\nApplicant began an inpatient program for the treatment of chemical dependency\non January 28, 2008, which he completed on February 25, 2008.  After completing the\n10\nprogram, he returned to the outpatient program the same evening. He then attended\nsessions on a regular basis, and he completed the outpatient program in early May\n2008,  approximately when he began his current employment. \n11\n\n Exhibit A. \n12\n Exhibit B. \n13\n Exhibit 1. \n14\n Exhibit 1 at 24 of 27. \n15\n Although these matters were not alleged in the SOR, I considered them for the limited purpose of assessing\n16\nApplicant\u2019s credibility and for assessing his evidence of reform and rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (describing five examples when it is proper to consider conduct not\nalleged in an SOR) (citations omitted). \n Tr. 101\u2013111. \n17\n Tr. 56\u201357. \n18\n Tr. 37, 40. \n19\n4\nIt was during February 2008 that he began testing negative for cocaine, and he\nthereafter tested negative until testing ended in September 2008.  In addition, he tested\n12\nnegative during pre-employment drug testing in April 2008.  \n13\nAt the end of May 2008, Applicant completed a security clearance application for\nhis employment.  In response to Question 24a, which asked about illegal drug use in\n14\nthe last seven years, Applicant answered in the affirmative by indicating he had used\ncocaine about 50 times during the period April 2002 (estimated) to June 2007. He also\nexplained that in January 2008 he had admitted himself to the inpatient rehabilitation\nprogram, and he stated that \u201cI was not taking when I entered and had been clean for\nabout 3 months.\u201d   \n15\nApplicant deliberately understated both the duration and frequency of his cocaine\nuse on his security clearance application.  In addition, his efforts in his hearing\n16\ntestimony to reconcile his answers on his security clearance application with the\nevidence of his drug use were not credible.  His testimony, that he provided an\n17\nestimate for both the duration and frequency of his cocaine use, was not persuasive or\ncredible. I make these findings in light of (1) the December 2007 contempt finding due\nto Applicant\u2019s testing positive for cocaine, and (2) that Applicant tested positive for\ncocaine multiple times in November 2007, December 2007, and January 2008. These\ncircumstances took place several months before Applicant completed the security\nclearance application, in which he stated a June 2007 end date for his cocaine use.\nApplicant\u2019s substance abuse counselor, father, and brother all testified on\nApplicant\u2019s behalf. Their testimony was credible and worthy of belief. \nThe substance abuse counselor considers Applicant a success story due to his\nattitude in addressing his drug abuse.  In the counselor\u2019s opinion, Applicant turned\n18\naround completely and has an excellent prognosis.  To that end, Applicant submitted a\n19\n\n Exhibit F. \n20\n Tr. 35, 53\u201354. \n21\n Tr. 60. \n22\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n23\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n24\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n25\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n26\n5\nstatement of intent agreeing to remain drug-free and agreeing to automatic revocation\nof a security clearance if he violated his pledge to remain drug-free.  Of note, the\n20\ncounselor viewed the drug abuse as the major issue for Applicant, as alcohol was not a\nmajor concern.  \n21\nBoth the father and brother have observed the turnaround made by Applicant,\nwith one describing the changes as like \u201cnight and day.\u201d  Both gentlemen, who have\n22\nregular contact with Applicant and are wholly supportive of Applicant and his wife, have\nseen no indications or signs that Applicant has relapsed since completing the inpatient\nprogram in early 2008. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. The only purpose of a clearance decision is to decide\nif an applicant is suitable for access to classified information. Moreover, the Department\nof Defense takes the handling and safeguarding of classified information seriously\nbecause it affects our national security, the lives of our servicemembers, and our\noperations abroad. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n23\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n24\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n25\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n26\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n27\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n28\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n29\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n30\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n31\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n32\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n33\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22, and 23 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n34\n6\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The Government has the burden of presenting\n27\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n28\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n29\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n30\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.31\nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of\nfact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.32\nThe Adjudicative Guidelines set forth the relevant standards to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions for each guideline. In addition, each clearance decision must be a\ncommonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant and material\ninformation, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-person\nconcept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the Government. The Government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n33\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nThe allegations under Guideline G  for alcohol consumption are addressed\n34\nsummarily. Although the SOR alleges security concerns due to Applicant\u2019s past use of\ncocaine and alcohol, the evidence established that the overriding problem or issue for\nApplicant was his cocaine use. He did receive a secondary diagnosis of alcohol\ndependence, and the evidence shows he has abstained from alcohol since at least\nFebruary 2008, a period of two years when the record closed. Applicant has mitigated\n\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 24, 25, and 26 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating conditions). \n35\n AG \u00b6 24. \n36\n AG \u00b6 25(a). \n37\n AG \u00b6 25(b). \n38\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(d) and 25(e).\n39\n AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b) and 26(d). \n40\n7\nthe security concerns under Guideline G through a combination of inpatient and\noutpatient treatment, family involvement, and a good employment record. Accordingly,\nGuideline G is decided for Applicant.\nThe gravamen of the SOR is the allegations under Guideline H  for drug\n35\ninvolvement. Under the guideline, the overall security concern is that:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.36\nThe guideline contains a number of conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. Several apply in this case as follows: (1) Applicant\u2019s use of\ncocaine, which constitutes drug abuse, for a multiple-year period ending in about\nJanuary 2008;  (2) Applicant tested positive multiple times for illegal drug use;  and (3)\n37\n38\nApplicant received a diagnosis or evaluation or both of cocaine dependence.  Of note,\n39\nApplicant tested positive for cocaine while under the supervision of a juvenile court\nhandling the custody case, and he was found in contempt of court for doing so. Taken\ntogether, these circumstances raise serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s fitness or\nsuitability for access to classified information.\nThe guideline contains a number of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. Applicant receives credit in mitigation based on (1) his demonstrated intent\nnot to abuse drugs in the future, and (2) his successful completion of the inpatient and\noutpatient programs in 2008.  To his credit, and his family\u2019s credit for their sustained\n40\nsupport and involvement, Applicant has abstained from cocaine use since\napproximately February 2008. After completing the inpatient and outpatient programs,\nApplicant found gainful employment, which appears to be his first full-time job in many\nyears. He and his wife were successful in persuading the juvenile court to return\ncustody of their children to them, and he appears to be actively engaged with both his\njob and his family. \nAt this point, the signs or indicators are positive, but for one notable exception\u2014\nApplicant\u2019s deliberate understatement of both the duration and frequency of his cocaine\n\n AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n41\n8\nuse on his security clearance application as well as his hearing testimony in which he\nattempted to justify or rationalize his answers. His failure to give full, frank, and candid\nanswers about his cocaine use and his lack of credibility in his hearing testimony\nundermine his evidence of reform and rehabilitation. It does so because honesty and\nwillingness to self-report are key factors or considerations in this regard. An individual,\nlike Applicant, who is dishonest with himself or others about the full extent of his drug\nabuse is not a rehabilitation success. Given these circumstances, a longer period of\nabstinence from cocaine use is prudent and sensible before a safe predictive judgment\ncan be made about Applicant\u2019s suitability or fitness to hold a security clearance.\nAccordingly, Guideline H is decided against Applicant.   \nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history of\ncocaine use justify current doubts about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\nFollowing Egan and the clearly-consistent standard, these doubts are resolved in favor\nof protecting national security. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to\nthe whole-person concept  and Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. Nevertheless, Applicant\n41\ndid not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.\nThis case is decided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 2.a\u20132.c:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.        \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 18, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).

Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 41 years old and works\nfor a defense contractor.  He previously worked for another defense contractor from 2003 to 2007.\nHe is married with four children.\nApplicant began consuming alcohol at about age 15.  By the time he was in his thirties,\nApplicant consumed alcohol at home every night.  For a period of about 10 years, Applicant\nconsumed one to two pints of vodka daily.\nFrom November 2007 through June 2008 Applicant received poor job performance\nevaluations.  Part of this period occurred while Applicant was drinking daily, although, at the\nhearing, Applicant stated that his alcohol use had not affected his job performance.  \nWhen drinking, Applicant experienced \u201canger issues.\u201d  Decision at 3.  He would be verbally\nabusive and aggressive to members of his family.  In February 2008, several members of his family\nmet with Applicant, expressed their concerns to him about his drinking, and advised that they had\nreserved a place for him at a treatment center.  Applicant entered the center, although the admission\nnotes state that he \u201chad significant anger, did not seem motivated or willing to be there, and stated\nthat he \u2018would seek treatment for thirty days and not extend his treatment.\u2019\u201d Id.  A physician at the\ntreatment center diagnosed Applicant as alcohol dependent. \nApplicant expressed a desire to transition out of the facility \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d  Id. at 4.\nAn official at the treatment center recommended that he attend an intensive outpatient appointment,\nattend daily Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings, continue individual therapy, and attend marital\ncounseling.  He canceled the appointment for the outpatient treatment.  He attends AA meetings\napproximately once a month.  He has abstained from alcohol since February 2008.  A\npsychotherapist interviewed Applicant and concluded that his alcohol dependence is in remission.\nApplicant talked with the psychotherapist for \u201ca couple of hours.\u201d  Id. at 5.  She did not conduct tests\nor review his medical records. \n Applicant contends that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions is erroneous.  He\navers that the Judge should have favorably applied three mitigating conditions: ACMC 23(a),  (b),\n2\n3\n\n\u201c[T]he individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with\n4\nany required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program[.]\u201d\nSee Government Exhibit (GE) 4, Medical Records, at 80: \u201cClient does not seem too motivated or willing to\n5\nbe here.\u201d\nThe Judge\u2019s findings include a  reference to the Subject Personal Interview conducted as part of Applicant\u2019s\n6\nsecurity clearance investigation.  Included in GE 2, Response to Interrogatories, the interview summary attributes to\nApplicant certain comments that suggest ambivalence toward his problem.  \u201cThe reason for consuming alcohol was to\nrelax. [Applicant] did not feel that his drinking was out of control but his wife did.  Drinking alcohol did not have any\neffect on [Applicant\u2019s] behavior.  Drinking alcohol did not cause any problems or contribute to any problems . . .\n[Applicant] has always been responsible with his consumption of alcohol. [Applicant] stopped drinking for his family.\u201d\n \nand (d).   He also contends that a proper whole-person analysis further supports a favorable decision\n4\nin his case.  Applicant\u2019s discussion of these issues focuses in large measure upon record evidence\nthat he had completed an alcohol treatment program, that he has been abstinent since entering the\nprogram, and the diagnosis of alcohol dependence in remission from the psychotherapist.  Applicant\ndoes not challenge the Judge\u2019s findings per se, but he does challenge the Judge\u2019s weighing of the\nevidence.\nIn the Analysis portion of the decision, the Judge discussed evidence favorable to Applicant,\nsuch as that cited above.  However, she also noted record evidence that cuts the other way.  For\nexample, she stated Applicant\u2019s medical records \u201cshow that he sometimes appeared angry and\nunwilling to be at the treatment center.\u201d   Id. at 7.  She also referred to evidence that (1) Applicant\n5\nwanted to leave the center as soon as possible, despite his counselor\u2019s recommendation that he\nremain and (2) Applicant did not fully comply with all of the after care recommendations, such as\ndaily participation in AA.  She concluded that, in light of the many years during which Applicant\ndrank \u201cto his own and his family\u2019s detriment\u201d (Id. at 10), his 18 months of sobriety were not\nsufficient to demonstrate that he had truly gained control of his problem.   She also explained that\n6\nshe accorded the psychotherapist\u2019s diagnosis of remission less weight due to the limited time the\ntherapist spent talking with Applicant and the absence of tests or records review.  \nAlthough Applicant has presented a plausible favorable interpretation of the record evidence,\nthat is not enough to demonstrate that the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to\nlaw.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  In order to prevail, an\napplicant must demonstrate that he has mitigated the security concerns alleged in the SOR under the\nstandard set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), which requires that\n\u201ca clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national\nsecurity.\u2019\u201d This standard is in accord with the national security interests which it is designed to\nguard.  After considering the decision, the record, and the briefs of the parties , the Board concludes\nthat Judge has drawn a rational connection between the record and her ultimate decision.  This\nconnection is not undermined by the evidence which Applicant discusses in his appeal.      \n\nIn support of his appeal, Applicant discusses other Hearing Office cases which he contends\ngranted clearances under facts similar to his own.  The Board gives due consideration to this\nargument.  However, each case \u201cmust be decided upon its own merits.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3.  Hearing\nOffice decisions are binding neither on other Hearing Office Judges nor on the Board.  See ISCR\nCase No. 06-24121 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2008).  In light of the discussion above, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision is sustainable.  \u201cThe Board need not\nagree with a Judge\u2019s decision in order to find it sustainable.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 06-23881 at 2 (App.\nBd.

After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were \nunable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn March 18, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nthat specified the basis for its decision: security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of the \nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 Applicant signed his notarized Answer to the \nSOR on April 13, 2009, in which he admitted to allegation 1.c. and denied the remaining \ntwo allegations under Guideline G. He also denied allegation 2.a. under Guideline E. \nApplicant requested a decision before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on May 12, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on May 15, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 5, 2009 and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on July 7, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits, Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were admitted. Applicant testified and presented the \ntestimony of two witnesses. Applicant exhibits (AE) A through N, were admitted. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on July 16, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are admitted as fact. After a \nthorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, and the record \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 41 years old, received a bachelor\u2019s degree in computer information \nscience in 1990. He has been married for 16 years and has four children, who are 4, 10, \n11, and 14 years of age. Applicant worked as an associate for a defense contractor from \n2003 to 2007. He received good performance evaluations at this company in 2004, with \nsomewhat less satisfactory performance by 2006. He received several performance \nawards between 2003 and 2005. Subsequently, he worked as a systems engineer at \nanother company from April 2007 to August 2008. He then accepted employment at his \ncurrent company. During his initial interview, he informed the facility security officer \n(FSO) of his current company about his alcohol-related history (GE 1; AE D, K, L, M, N; \nTr.59). \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \nApplicant started consuming alcohol at about 15 years old, in approximately 1982, \nand was first intoxicated at the age of 15. He drank socially during the early years of his \nmarriage. However, by his thirties, he was drinking at home every night. His use then \nincreased substantially in his late thirties. According to his alcohol treatment records, \nwhen he began treatment, he had been drinking approximately one to two pints of vodka \ndaily, and this had been his pattern for approximately ten years. He drank throughout the \nday on weekends. His longest period of abstinence was a week or two (GE 3; GE 4 at \np.51; Tr. 32-33, 72-73). \n \nDuring the period November 2007 through June 2008, Applicant received poor \nwork performance evaluations. He did not turn in timely status updates. The fact that he \nworked off-site adversely affected his performance, so he was required to work at the \noffice site. He arrived late and left early, instead of working a full day. He was specifically \nwarned that he was required to work 8:00 am to 5:00 pm and to charge only the hours \nthat he worked. He was given 30 days to improve his performance. Part of this period of \npoor performance occurred while Applicant was drinking daily, and before he attended \ntreatment. When asked at the hearing to describe his occupational problems, which were \nnoted in his alcohol treatment record, he said he did not know what they were. When \nasked if his alcohol use had affected his job performance, he said that it had not (GE 4, \n5; Tr. 54, 75-77). \n \nApplicant testified that when he was drinking he became withdrawn and had \n\u201canger issues.\u201d His wife reported to his treatment counselor that Applicant was \naggressive and verbally abusive when drinking, and would become angry and yell at the \nchildren. At the hearing, she testified that as a result of this behavior, the children \nbecame cautious around him. Several members of Applicant\u2019s family, including his wife \nand children, arranged an intervention in February 2008. They met with Applicant, \nexpressed their concerns, and described the negative effect his alcohol use was having \non the family. His wife had reserved a place for him at a treatment center in another \nstate. Applicant agreed to go, although the admission notes in his treatment record \ncomment that Applicant had significant anger, did not seem motivated or willing to be \nthere, and stated that he \u201cwould seek treatment for thirty days and not extend his \ntreatment.\u201d During his interview with the investigator, he said that he \u201cagreed to go for \npeace of mind for his family\u201d and that he \u201cstopped drinking for his family.\u201d He participated \nin a 30-day inpatient program from February to March 2008. He met with a counselor \nindividually \u201ca couple of times\u201d but was involved primarily in group sessions (GE 2, 3; GE \n4 at pp. 60, 72; AE A; Tr. 45-46, 68-71, 73-75, 80). \n \nApplicant was diagnosed by a physician at the treatment center with alcohol \ndependence. He testified that his counselor explained the meaning of alcohol \ndependence to him. The counselor\u2019s Clinical Impression Report stated that Applicant \nwas prone to relapse and \u201chas been dinking [sic] in spite of negative consequences.\u201d It \nmentioned twice that he \u201cis in need of structured environment.\u201d ((GE 4, pp. 12, 46; Tr. \n78-79). \n3\n \n\n \nThe treatment notes of February 29, 2008, stated that Applicant wanted to \ncomplete his assignments so he could \u201ctransition out of treatment as soon as possible.\u201d \n(GE 4, p. 68). On March 14, 2008, the therapy notes indicate that the clinician,  \n \ninformed [Applicant's wife] of the current concerns regarding her husband\u2019s \ndecision to return home; client\u2019s wife stated she misses  her  husband  and  \nwants him home; this writer facilitated family contact which emphasized the \nimportance  of  client  following  all  discharge  aftercare recommendations.  \nClient will be supplied with an after care plan (GE 4, pp. 63-64). \n \nThe clinician recommended that Applicant attend intensive outpatient appointment, \nobtain an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sponsor, attend daily AA meetings, complete the \n12-step program, continue individual therapy, and attend marriage counseling. The notes \nof March 21, 2008, show that the treatment center set up an appointment for Applicant at \nan intensive outpatient mental health center in his local area. (GE 4 at p. 60). Applicant \ncancelled the appointment for intensive outpatient treatment: \n \nI did not go to that.  I returned to my life and I felt good, that I didn't need it, the \nadditional cost.  I feel confident that I have a good control over where I was.  I \nhave broken the cycle of alcohol.\u201d (GE 4, at p. 81). \n \n \nApplicant admits that he is a recovering alcoholic. He has a support system to \nhelp him maintain sobriety including his wife, his church, and others he can call. After \ncompleting the inpatient treatment, Applicant attended AA meetings two to three times \nper week. He testified that currently, \u201cI don't attend AA as often as I should. I would say \nprobably once a month at least.\u201d (Answer to SOR; Tr. 61, 80-81).  \n \nAfter completing alcohol rehabilitation in March 2008, Applicant met with an \nauthorized investigator for the Department of Defense for a security clearance interview \non July 9, 2008. The interview is reported in a document that Applicant received from \nDOHA. He was asked to review the report, verify its accuracy, and correct \ndiscrepancies, if any. Applicant submitted a signed and notarized statement indicating \nthat the report accurately reflected his interview (GE 2). \n \n \nDuring the interview, Applicant told the investigator that before treatment he drank \napproximately one pint of vodka daily, that he drank at home when he was alone, and \nthat he became intoxicated daily. He stated that he did not think his drinking was out of \ncontrol at that time, but his wife did. In addition, he told the investigator that his alcohol \nuse did not cause any problems, or contribute to any problems. He also stated that it did \nnot have any effect on his behavior. He testified, \u201cWell, at the time, that's how I felt.  \n\u2026So when they asked me when you were drinking did you have a problem, of course, I \ndid not have.  When I was drinking, everything was good. In hindsight, yes, I can agree \nwith that, that I did have a problem.\u201d He also told the interviewer that he had used \nalcohol responsibly because he used it at home, in a controlled setting, and it was a \n\u201cresponsible way of drinking.\u201d Finally, when asked about alcohol diagnoses, Applicant \n4\n \n\n \ntold the investigator that he \u201chas not ever been diagnosed with an alcohol abuse problem \nor dependency.\u201d He explained at the hearing that he thought the agent was asking if he \nhad ever been diagnosed as alcohol dependent before the alcohol treatment they had \njust been discussing. When he received the report of the interview, he still thought the \ndiscussion was about whether or not he had been diagnosed with alcohol dependence \nbefore the intervention (GE 2; Tr. 62-65, 77-78). \n \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a psychotherapist in his local area in June 2009 for \n\u201csubstance abuse evaluation in connection with his upcoming security clearance \nhearing.\u201d The psychotherapist found that Applicant has been abstinent since February \n18, 2008, responded positively to inpatient treatment, and attends AA regularly. She \ndetermined that Applicant's \u201csobriety is stable and his alcohol dependence is in \nremission.\u201d Applicant testified that he talked with the psychotherapist for \u201ca couple of \nhours\u201d and that she did not conduct tests or review his medical records (AE B, C; Tr. 81-\n82). \n \nSeveral of Applicant's family members submitted letters attesting to Applicant's \ntrustworthiness and sense of responsibility, and noted his dedication to his country both \nin the military and as an employee of a defense contractor. Applicant's current FSO, who \nhas known him for nine months, opined that Applicant has \u201cone of the highest levels of \nhonesty and integrity that I have witnessed in my 35 years of military and security \ntraining.\u201d A friend, who holds a security clearance, submitted a letter attesting to \nApplicant's sobriety for 16 months and his ability to overcome his alcohol issues (AE D \nthrough I).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nthe cited guidelines.   \n \n \nA security clearance decision resolves only the questions of whether it is clearly \n5\n                                                 \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n \n\n \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of producing \nadmissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a \nsecurity clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to \nthe applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one \nhas a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5  \n \n \nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite \njudgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as \nhis or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels \nresolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of \nthe government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern about alcohol consumption is that \u201cexcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to \ncontrol impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d (AG \u00b6 21). \n \nAG \u00b6 22 includes the following relevant disqualifying conditions: \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an \nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or \nalcohol dependence; \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol to the point of intoxication daily, starting in his late \nthirties. The dates when his work performance suffered occurred, at least in part, during \nthe time period when he was drinking significant amounts of alcohol every night. His \nalcohol use also caused him to be verbally abusive to his wife and children. His \nbehavior led his family to perform an intervention to encourage him to obtain treatment. \n6\n                                                 \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n\n \nApplicant completed 30 days of inpatient treatment, where he was diagnosed with \nalcohol dependence by a physician. These facts support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(c) and \n22(d). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following relevant factors that can mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations, such as participation in meetings of Alcoholics \nAnonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program. \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related behavior was frequent: he used alcohol for many \nyears, and increased his use in his late thirties to the point that he became intoxicated \ndaily between approximately 2006 and 2008. A significant amount of time has not \npassed since ending this behavior, as he has been abstinent since February 2008, only \n18 months. Although his abstinence reflects well on his current good judgment, his use \nof alcohol was both frequent and recent. Only partial mitigation applies under AG \u00b6 \n23(a). \n \nApplicant acknowledges that he is a recovering alcoholic. He completed a 30-day \nalcohol treatment program in March 2008, where he was diagnosed as alcohol-\ndependent. As of the date of the hearing, he had not had alcohol for approximately 18 \nmonths and he plans not to use alcohol in the future. All of these facts weigh in \nApplicant's favor. However, several facts raise questions as to Applicant's real \nunderstanding and acceptance of the fact that he has a serious problem with alcohol. \nThe treatment notes show that he sometimes appeared angry and unwilling to be at the \ntreatment center, that he wanted to get the treatment done as fast as possible, and was \nunwilling to remain more than 30 days. Despite the counselor\u2019s opinion that he was not \nready to leave treatment, Applicant did not remain at the center. The counselor \n7\n \n\n \ntherefore recommended that Applicant continue with intensive outpatient treatment near \nhis home, and even set up an appointment so that Applicant could do so. However, \nApplicant cancelled the appointment because he did not feel that he needed it. \nMoreover, he told the investigator at his security interview that he attended the program \n\u201cfor his family.\u201d Applicant\u2019s conduct indicates that he although he acquiesced to his \nfamily\u2019s intervention, he did not fully acknowledge or accept the nature of his condition. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) provides only limited mitigation. \n \nAs to AG \u00b6 23(d), Applicant receives some mitigation for attending an alcohol \ntreatment program, participating in AA frequently when he returned from the program, \nand abstaining from alcohol for the past 18 months. However, although Applicant \ncompleted the program, it is questionable whether he completed it successfully, given \nthat he failed to follow his counselor\u2019s recommendation to either remain in the program \nor continued the treatment at another facility. Moreover, he is not following his aftercare \nplan as he is not participating in AA as frequently as recommended. Finally, although he \nwas evaluated by a qualified medical professional as being in remission, the evaluation \nprovides no favorable prognosis for the future, as AG \u00b6 23(d) requires. In addition, the \nevaluation is accorded less weight because it is based on a one-time meeting with a \ntherapist who did not review Applicant's medical records, and arrived at her opinion \nsolely based on self-reporting by Applicant. Taking all the facts and circumstances \ntogether, the limited mitigation available is insufficient to overcome the disqualifying \nconditions. I find against Applicant on Guideline G. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure \nto cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe Guideline E allegations implicate the following disqualifying conditions under \nAG \u00b6 16: \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security \nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government \nrepresentative; \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified information that he provided to an \ninvestigator during his security interview of July 9, 2008, which implicates AG \u00b6 16(b). \n8\n \n\n \nApplicant signed a statement that the report of the interview accurately reflected the \nstatements he made. He was permitted to correct any information that he thought \ninaccurate, but made no corrections. When Applicant met with the security investigator, \nhe was honest about his alcohol use, frequency, intoxication, and his own and his wife\u2019s \nfeelings about it, and that his family intervened, and he was treated for 30 days on an \ninpatient basis. However, he stated that he had never been diagnosed with alcohol \ndependency, despite the fact that he received that diagnosis approximately four months \nearlier. He was aware of the diagnosis, because he testified that the counsellor \nexplained the meaning of the term \u201calcohol dependence\u201d as it applied to Applicant.  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant credibly testified that, when the investigator asked him if \nhe had been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, he thought she was asking if he had ever \nhad such a diagnosis in the past, before the treatment they had been discussing. If he \nhad been trying to conceal his diagnosis, it is unlikely he would have openly admitted all \nthe details he had provided to the investigator about his extensive history of drinking \nalcohol, his increased use to the point of daily intoxication, his family\u2019s intervention and \nhis 30 days of alcohol treatment. Moreover, when Applicant was asked in a simple \nstatement, in SOR allegation 1.c., whether he was diagnosed as alcohol-dependent, he \nadmitted it. I find that Applicant did not deliberately conceal information about his \ndiagnosis during the interview, but simply misunderstood the question that he was \nasked. As no deliberate falsification occurred, mitigation is not required. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \n9\n \n\n \n \n10\n \nApplicant is 41 years old, and has been consuming alcohol since he was a \nteenager. It became a problem when Applicant was in his late thirties. He was becoming \nintoxicated daily by drinking one to two pints of vodka each day. He was verbally \nabusive to his wife and children when intoxicated, and his work suffered. At his family\u2019s \nbehest, Applicant attended a 30-day alcohol treatment program. Although he \nparticipated, his counselors noted his desire to leave as soon as possible. He \ncompleted the 30 days but, according to the treatment notes, he needed to continue \ntreatment. He cancelled the appointment for the intensive outpatient treatment, which \nhad been set up by the treatment center\u2019s counselor. His attendance at AA has \ndecreased from several times per week to approximately once per month, and he \nadmits that he does not attend as often as he should. Commendably, Applicant has \nabstained for the past 18 months. However, this length of time must be compared to the \nyears he spent using alcohol to his own and his family\u2019s detriment. When taken \ntogether, Applicant's decreased attendance at AA, his lack of follow-through on his \ncounselor\u2019s recommendation for further treatment, and his relatively short period of \nabstinence raise doubts about his acceptance and understanding of his condition.  \n \n \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the \nalcohol consumption guideline. Overall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts \nraised about Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. - 1.c. \n \n \nAgainst Applicant   \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nFOR Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all of the 28 allegations in response to the SOR. Her admissions are included in my findings of fact. Applicant is 36 years old, and has been a claims associate for a defense contractor for about two years. She married in 1999. She is still legally married, but separated from her husband in 2003. She lives with another person and shares living expenses. She has no children. Her monthly income is approximately $1,259. Her monthly expenses are approximately $900, leaving her approximately $300 in monthly disposable income. She is able to meet her current expenses and make small payments on past due debts (Tr. 78-80, 86; Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated August 16, 2007). Applicant has been an excellent worker for her employer. Her average ratings are in the \"sometimes exceeds expectation\" category (App. Ex. A, Letter, dated October 12, 2009). She has also completed a number of training courses provided by her employer (App. Ex. F, Certificates, various dates). She has been commended for outstanding service on a number of occasions (App. Ex. G, Award certificates, various dates).

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: David Lamar Boulware, II, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, THOMAS M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Public Trust Position (SF 85P), on \nAugust 16, 2007, as part of her employment with a defense contractor. On July 27, \n2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F. The action was taken under Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation \n5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, as amended (Regulation); \nand the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued \nafter September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on August 3, \n2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response received at \nDOHA on August 25, 2009. She admitted the 28 allegations under Guideline F. She \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on September 21, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on September \n25, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 8, 2009, for a hearing on \nOctober 20, 2009. Applicant received the Notice of Hearing on October 12, 2009. I \n1 \n \nJanuary 26, 2010\n\n2 \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered seven exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant submitted ten exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through J, \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant called one witness and testified on her \nown behalf. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on November 3, 2009. \nBased on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received the Notice of Hearing on October 12, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.8). Applicant \ndiscussed with Department Counsel the hearing date of October 20, 2009, prior to the \nNotice of Hearing being mailed so actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to \nthe hearing. However, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only eight days prior to \nthe hearing. At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 5-6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted all of the 28 allegations in \nresponse to the SOR. Her admissions are included in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 36 years old, and has been a claims associate for a defense \ncontractor for about two years. She married in 1999. She is still legally married, but \nseparated from her husband in 2003. She lives with another person and shares living \nexpenses. She has no children. Her monthly income is approximately $1,259. Her \nmonthly expenses are approximately $900, leaving her approximately $300 in monthly \ndisposable income. She is able to meet her current expenses and make small payments \non past due debts (Tr. 78-80, 86; Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, \ndated August 16, 2007). \n \n \nApplicant has been an excellent worker for her employer. Her average ratings \nare in the \"sometimes exceeds expectation\" category (App. Ex. A, Letter, dated October \n12, 2009). She has also completed a number of training courses provided by her \nemployer (App. Ex. F, Certificates, various dates). She has been commended for \noutstanding service on a number of occasions (App. Ex. G, Award certificates, various \ndates).  \n \n \nFriends and former employers attest to her reputation for reliability and \ntrustworthiness. A friend noted that she has known Applicant for over 20 years and \nconsiders her trustworthy, reliable, and dependable. (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated October \n20, 2009). Her former employer noted that Applicant was a valued and trusted \nemployee who was promoted to assistant manager at one of his stores. Applicant \nmanaged the employees schedules, inventory, receipt of merchandise, store opening \nand closing, money, and bank deposits. There was never an issue concerning her \nreliability and trustworthiness (App. Ex. C, Letter, dated October 19, 2009). A fellow \n\n3 \n \nworker at her present job stated that she has known Applicant for two years and \nconsiders her a reliable and dependable worker who is an asset for the employer (App. \nEx. D, Letter, dated October 19, 2009). Applicant's pastor testified that he has known \nher for about two years. He believes she is absolutely trustworthy, and was put into a \ndifficult circumstance by her husband. She struggled and is struggling to pay her bills \n(Tr. 89-91), \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated June 17, 2009; Gov. Ex. 5, dated April 14, \n2009; Gov. Ex. 6, dated October 2, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 7, dated September 12, 2007) \nlisted 28 delinquent debts totaling approximately $49,113 owed by Applicant. The debts \ninclude 23 collection accounts, two judgments, and three charged-off accounts. The \ndelinquent debts consist of medical debts in collection for $31 (SOR 1.a), $54 (SOR \n1.b), $168 (SOR 1.c), $50 (SOR 1.d), $74 (SOR 1.e), $676 (SOR 1.f), and $108 (SOR \n1.g). There are two judgments for medical accounts for $748 (SOR 1.h), and $908 \n(SOR 1.i). There are delinquent debts in collection on credit cards or to department \nstores for $823 (SOR 1.j), $3,703 (SOR 1.k), $910 (SOR 1.l), $7,130 (SOR 1.m), $2,232 \n(SOR 1.n), $1,448 (SOR 1.o), $4,494 (SOR 1.p), $445 (SOR 1.r), $4,836 (SOR 1.t), \n$887 (SOR 1.u), $3,338 (SOR 1.w), $2,691 (SOR 1.x), $861 (SOR 1.y), $401 (SOR \n1.z), $7,902 (SOR 1.aa), and $106 (SOR 1.bb). There are three charged-off accounts to \na mail-order account for $45 (SOR 1.q), to a bank for $825 (SOR 1.s), and to a \ndepartment store for $764 (SOR 1.v). \n \n \nApplicant was current paying her debts until her husband started using drugs and \nalcohol in 2003. He stole Applicant's property and spent their funds to meet his \naddiction for drugs and alcohol. He stopped working because of his drug and alcohol \nabuse. Applicant also lost her job in March 2003 when the business where she worked \nclosed. Applicant finally left her husband in April 2003. She found new employment in \nMay 2003 at a store where she became a trusted employee. She was hired at another \nstore where she was again became a trusted employee. She moved up and was an \nassistant manager for over four years. She was at this position until starting work for her \npresent employer. By that time she left her husband, her finances had deteriorated, and \nshe was unable to pay her delinquent debts. She was using credit cards and loans to \nmeet her living expenses for food, clothes, and other items. She lacked funds to pay for \nher divorce and she was unable to start the divorce process until March 2008 (Tr. 28-\n32).   \n \n \nApplicant's personal information on her e-QIP was compromised when the e-QIP \nwas lost in transmission to the investigative agency. Applicant could not easily access \nher credit information, and could not get information through the internet. The credit \ninformation had to be verified, sent by mail, and was delayed. This process hindered her \nability to manage her delinquent debt payments (Tr. 36-38; App. Ex. E, OPM Letter, \ndated July 9, 2008).  \n \n \nThe delinquent debts from SOR 1.a through SOR 1.g are for medical debts in \ncollection. Applicant had medical problems starting with an operation in 2002 and \nincurred medical expenses. She is unsure of the origin of these debts and does not \nknow the original or follow-on creditors. She paid some medical expenses but is unsure \n\n4 \n \nif the payments relate to any of the medical debts listed in the SOR. She has not \ncontacted any creditors or made any payments on the debts (Tr. 48-52). She knows the \nmedical judgments at SOR 1.h and 1.i are from the local hospital. She contacted the \nhospital at the time the judgments were entered against her in 2003. She was unable to \npay the debts. She has not contacted the hospital since then and has not paid the debts \n(Tr. 53-54). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.j through 1.bb are to various creditors or \ncollection agencies for debts on credit card, for department stores, and for loans. \nApplicant acknowledges that she owes all of these debts. She has not been in contact \nwith most of these creditors and has not made payments on most of the debts. She \ndoes not have a plan to pay the debts. She made some payments on some medical and \nother debts, but is unable to connect the payments to any specific debt except for some \npayments made on the debt at SOR 1.y (Tr. 54-72; App. Ex. I, Checks, Various dates; \nApp. Ex. J Receipt, dated July 22, 2009).   \n \n \nIn her answer to interrogatories in December 2008, Applicant indicated she was \nin contact with a credit counseling service to create a debt management plan. She \nreceived a reply from them which provided her a long process for managing her \ndelinquent debts. She was still trying to gather her credit information for the credit \ncounseling agency, but is hindered because her personal information was \ncompromised. She states she is doing what she can to pay her debts. Her plan is to pay \nher debts as best she can while still paying her current debts, such as utilities and rent. \nShe says she is \"doing the best she can.\" She does not have a written budget, but \nknows financially what she can and cannot do. (Tr. 34-38, 74-75 App. Ex. H, Letter, \ndated April 8, 2009). \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all \navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \n\"assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d Trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA \nby the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management (See, The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004). Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded \nthe right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable \naccess determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust or a sensitive position, \nthe administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision (AG \u00b6 2(c)). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to protect sensitive \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt-free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, as established by credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a security concern raising Financial \n\n6 \n \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant has 28 delinquent debts consisting of medical bills, credit cards, telephone \nservice debts, and loans that have been delinquent for some time, indicating a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, as well as an inability or unwillingness to satisfy her \ndebts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions do not apply. The debts became \ndelinquent as early as 2003, are still unpaid, and are thus current debt. Applicant has \nnot paid in full any of the debts. Her ability to pay her debts on her present income is \nminimal. While she is current with her present bills, the likelihood of continued financial \nproblems are great. Applicant incurred the debts when her husband started using drugs \nand alcohol in 2003. She has made only minimal payments or inquiries concerning the \ndebts since then. Many of the debts are for small amounts and could be resolved with \nsmall payments. She has been gainfully employed since 2003 so she could have made \nsome payments on some debts. While her husband's drug and alcohol abuse led to her \nfinancial problems and were largely beyond her control, she has not inquired about the \ndebts or made payments, so she has not acted responsibly. When the debts mounted, \nshe basically ignored them and thus did not act responsibly. There is a strong indication \nher financial problems are likely to recur because she has only minimal funds to meet \nher present financial obligations and pay her past-due debts. The debts cast doubt on \nher reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI have considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). This mitigating condition partially applies. Applicant \nreceived financial counseling starting in December 2008, but she has not been active in \nworking with the credit counselor to help resolve her debt issues.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments. An applicant \nis not required to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed. The entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and her actions can reasonably be considered in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \n\n7 \n \ndetermination. All that is required is that an applicant demonstrates that she has \nestablished a plan to resolve her financial problems and has taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has not paid and is not making payments on her past due financial \nobligations. She has not even contacted most of the creditors to verify her debts. She \nhas made some payments on debts, which are minimal and without a plan. Applicant's \nlack of action to pay her debts is significant and credible information to show that she \nhas not acted reasonably under the circumstances. Applicant has not acted responsibly \ntowards her debts and finances under the circumstances. Applicant has not presented \nsufficient information to mitigate security concerns for financial considerations because \nshe did not establish that the reasons for her debts were beyond her control and that \nshe took reasonable and responsible efforts to manage her finances. Her finances \nindicate a public trust concern.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant is a good \nemployee and is well regarded by her employer. Her co-workers, supervisor, friends, \nand pastor believe she is a reliable and trustworthy person. I considered that Applicant's \nhusband's drug abuse was a major cause of her financial problems \n \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of paying her delinquent \ndebts, since she has not made payments on them. Applicant paid two debts but was \nunable to specifically determine which debt was paid, nor did she provide \ndocumentation to verify payment to a specific debt except for a payment made on the \ndebt at SOR 1.y. She has not acted reasonably and responsibly towards her finances \nwhich indicates she may not act reasonably and responsibly to protect sensitive \n\n8 \n \ninformation. In the future, if Applicant is able to establish a meaningful track record of \ndebt payment and reduction, she should be afforded the opportunity to establish \neligibility for a position of public trust. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from her financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.bb:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.  Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted three and denied 38 of the forty- one allegations in response to the SOR. She admitted more of the debts at the hearing but disputed the amount of the debts. Applicant is 39 years old, and has been a claims associate, trainer or provider relations representative for a defense contractor for over 17 years. She married in 1997, but has been divorced since March 2008. She has three children, two still at home. She also received her bachelor's degree in 2008. She has been cleared for access to sensitive information in the past. Her monthly income is approximately $2,785. Her monthly expenses were $2,785. In October 2009, she paid off her automobile loan which provided her with $239.89 in disposable income which she will allocate to debt payments (Tr. 21-25, 77-87, Gov.

On June 3, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, \nas amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR \non June 15, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing in an undated response received at \nDOHA on July 27, 2009. She admitted three and denied 38 allegations under Guideline \nF. She requested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on August 25, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 4, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 8, 2009, for a hearing \non October 21, 2009. Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on October 20, 2009. I \n1 \n \nJanuary 15, 2010\n\n2 \n \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered six exhibits, marked \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6, which were received without objection. \nApplicant submitted nine exhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through I, \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant called one witness, and testified on her \nown behalf. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional documents. \nApplicant timely submitted six additional documents marked and received as App Ex J \nthrough O. Department Counsel had no objection to admission of the additional \nApplicant exhibits (Gov. Ex. 6, E-Mail, dated December 3, 2009). DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on November 5, 2009. Based on a review of the case file, \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to sensitive information is \ndenied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on October 20, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed \nwith Department Counsel the hearing date of October 21, 2009, prior to the Notice of \nHearing being mailed so actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing. \nHowever, Applicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only one day prior to the hearing. \nAt the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 5-7). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact. Applicant admitted three and denied 38 of the forty-\none allegations in response to the SOR. She admitted more of the debts at the hearing \nbut disputed the amount of the debts.  \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, and has been a claims associate, trainer or provider \nrelations representative for a defense contractor for over 17 years. She married in 1997, \nbut has been divorced since March 2008. She has three children, two still at home. She \nalso received her bachelor's degree in 2008. She has been cleared for access to \nsensitive information in the past. Her monthly income is approximately $2,785. Her \nmonthly expenses were $2,785. In October 2009, she paid off her automobile loan \nwhich provided her with $239.89 in disposable income which she will allocate to debt \npayments (Tr. 21-25, 77-87, Gov. Ex. 1, Questionnaire for Public Trust Position, dated \nJune 4, 2007; App. Ex. D, Resume, undated; App. Ex. I, Leave and Earnings statement, \ndated July 17, 2009; App. Ex. N, Cash flow summary, undated).  \n \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 4, dated July 4, 2007; Gov. Ex. 5, dated September 8, \n2008; and Gov. Ex. 6, Credit report, dated March 3, 2009) listed 40 delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $29,931 for Applicant. The debts include 37 collection accounts, \nconsisting of 24 medical accounts, two apartment rental accounts, two utility accounts, \none department store account, three delinquent credit card accounts, one furniture store \naccount, four telephone accounts; one automobile repossession debt, a past due \nstudent loan, and an account charged off as a bad debt. There is also an allegation for \nuttering a worthless check (SOR 1.oo). \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant's husband was a drug abuser. Applicant's finances deteriorated \nbecause she provided him with funds with the intent to save the marriage. She started \nhaving financial problems in 2006, and she is still dealing with the financial fallout. In \naddition, her oldest daughter has mental health medical issues resulting in medical \ndebts (Tr. 22-23; 77-87).  \n \n \nDuring her marriage and after her divorce, Applicant did not have the funds to \nmake payments on her debts. When she received bills, she ignored them because they \ndid not look right or she did not understand them. She realized the extent of her \nfinancial problems when she received the SOR in June 2009. She retrieved her credit \nreports and learned of the extent of her indebtedness. She also discovered that she did \nnot have any information on many of her debts. She consulted a financial counselor \nwho started assisting her with her financial issues by providing her a means to verify her \ndebts. She counseled her to pay her car loan to free funds for further debt reduction. \nApplicant's plan is to pay her smallest debt first before moving to resolve her bigger \ndebts. She is scheduled to continue financial counseling (Tr. 23-24 66-67, 87-88; App. \nEx. A, Letter, dated October 20, 2009; App. Ex. E, Course sign-up, dated October 20, \n2009; App. Ex. J, Letter, dated November 2, 2009). Applicant provided a summary of \nsome of her actions to contact creditors and resolve her debts (App. Ex. K, Credit \nmanagement ledger, dated November 5, 2009). \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged most of the debts, but disputes the amount owed on a \nmajority of the debts. She wrote to some of the medical creditors, and sent similar \ndispute letters to the three credit reporting agencies (Tr. 49-50; App. Ex. C, Letter, dated \nJuly 20, 2009, App. Ex F, G, and H, Letters, dated June 15, 2009). She received a reply \nfrom two of the credit reporting agencies and some of the debts have been deleted from \nher credit reports. No reasons for the deletions were provided by the credit reporting \nagencies (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated August 19, 2009; App. Ex. O, Letter dated \nSeptember 1, 2009). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.a for $1,576 is for past due rent for an apartment \nApplicant vacated before the lease terms expired. The company charged her for two \nmonths rent after she vacated the apartment. Applicant did not dispute the debt but \ndisputed the amount. She claims she had an agreement with the property manager that \nshe owed only one month rent of $775 plus a $200 damage fee for a total of $975. The \ndispute has not been resolved and Applicant has not paid any of the delinquent debt \n(Tr. 32-39). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts for $261 (SOR 1.b), $282 (SOR 1.c), $198 (SOR 1.d), $66 \nSOR 1.f), $113 (SOR 1.i), $806 (SOR 1.j), $307 (SOR 1.k), $308 (SOR 1.l), $1,579 \n(SOR 1.m), $97 (SOR 1.n), $277 (SOR 1.o), $945 (SOR 1.p), $166 (SOR 1.q), $88 \n(SOR 1.r), $43 (SOR 1.w), $5,454 (SOR 1.z), $1,577 (SOR 1.aa), $1,163 (SOR 1.bb), \n$813 (SOR 1.dd), $316 (SOR 1.gg), $265 (SOR 1.hh), $100 (SOR 1.jj), $99 (SOR 1.kk), \n$91 (SOR 1.ll),and $75 (SOR 1.mm) are medical debts from co-payments or other \ncharges for either Applicant or her daughter. Applicant had primary care health \ninsurance coverage so she did not understand the medical charges. She thinks her out-\nof-pocket charges should be minimal (Tr. 44-45). She requested validation of the debts \n\n4 \n \nfrom some of the medical debt collection agencies (Tr. 49-50). App. Ex. F, G, and H, \nLetters, dated June 15, 2009). She received one response with an account of the \ncharges, noting that she had 14 accounts with a balance of $2,782, and offering a \npayment plan of $50 per month (App. Ex. L, Letter, dated October 29, 2009). She has \nnot taken any action on this settlement offer. She also requested validation of the \nmedical debts from the credit reporting agencies (App. Ex. C, Letter, dated July 20, \n2009). She received a response from one of the credit reporting agencies. Some of the \nmedical debts were verified and others were deleted from her credit report. Applicant \nwas unable to match the deleted accounts with any SOR allegations. Applicant has not \nmade payments on any of the medical debts still outstanding (Tr. 50-56; App. Ex. B, \nLetter, dated August 19, 2009). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.e is for the rent on an apartment from which \nApplicant was evicted. She disputed the amount of the debt but not the debt itself. One \nof the credit reporting agencies deleted the debt from her report without providing any \nreason for the deletion (Tr. 42-44, App. Ex. C, Letter dated July 20, 2009; App. Ex. B, \nCredit reporting agency letter, dated August 19, 2009). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt alleged at SOR 1.g is for a utility debt of $237 Applicant \nincurred at one of her apartments. Applicant does not dispute the debt itself but does \ndispute the amount of the debt. She does not believe the debt should be for more than \n$200. She requested that the amount be verified but she has not received a response. \nShe has not made payments on this debt and has no plan as to how she will pay the \ndebt (Tr. 46-49). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.h for $525, SOR 1.t for $234, SOR 1.cc for \n$1,003, SOR 1.ee for $738, and SOR 1.ii for $234 are to various telephone providers for \ncell phone bills. The debts at SOR 1.t, 1.ee and 1.ii appear to be the same debt. The \ncreditor has closed this account based on Applicant's dispute (App. Ex. M, Letter, dated \nAugust 29, 2009). Applicant does not dispute the remaining telephone service debts but \ndisputes the amount of each of the debts. She requested verification of the debt but has \nnot received a reply. She has not made any payments on the debts (Tr. 50-51, 58-62). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.s for $348 is to a department store. The delinquent \ndebt at SOR 1.v is for a charged off amount of $445 on a credit card. The delinquent \ndebt at SOR 1.x for $903 is for a credit card Applicant used to rent cars after her car \nwas repossessed. Applicant does not dispute these debts but disputes the amount \nowed on each of the debts. She asked for verification of the debts but has not received \na reply. She has not made any payments on the debts. In addition, Applicant will not \nmake any payments on the debt at SOR 1.x until she pays off other smaller debts. The \ndelinquent debt at SOR 1.ff for $369 is for furniture. Applicant believes she paid the debt \nin full but does not have a receipt. She requested verification of the debt but has not \nreceived a reply (TR. 59-50, 64-67). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.u is for a past due amount of $890 on Applicant's \nstudent loans. The student loans are now in deferment and there is no past due amount \nowed on the loans (Tr. 63-64).  \n\n5 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.y for $158 is for a utility bill. The debt was paid \nwhen incurred and is not a delinquent debt (Tr. 66, See. Response to SOR). \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.nn for $5,601 is the remainder debt owed on car \nrepossession. Applicant contacted the creditor but they would not settle the debt. The \ncreditor requests a lump sum payment. Applicant is unable to make such a payment. \nApplicant has not made any arrangements to pay this debt (Tr. 67-68). \n \n \nApplicant was charged twice with issuing a fraudulent check. One was to a \ngrocery store, and the other to a department store. Applicant redeemed both checks by \npaying cash immediately after being notified by the stores that the checks had not \ncleared the bank. The grocery store dropped the charge. The department store \ncontinued to pursue the charge even after redemption of the check. This charge led to \nthe financial concern for fraudulent check listed at SOR 1.oo (Tr. 24-25, 89-91) \n   \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all \navailable information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \n\"assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d Trustworthiness adjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA \nby the Defense Security Service and Office of Personnel Management (See, The \nDeputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and Security) Memorandum, \ndated November 19, 2004. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded \nthe right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable \naccess determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust or a sensitive position, \nthe administrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. The entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision (AG \u00b6 2(c)). \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \n\n6 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThere is a public trust concern for a failure or inability to live within one=s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations indicating poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligation to \nprotect sensitive information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life. \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a public trust position. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, as established by credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony, are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \nApplicant has approximately forty delinquent debts consisting of medical bills, credit \ncards, utility and telephone service, and a car repossession that have been delinquent \nfor some time indicating a history of not meeting financial obligations, as well as an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy her debts. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \n\n7 \n \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions do not apply. The debts became \ndelinquent as early as 2001, are still unpaid, and are thus current debt. Applicant \nincurred the debts because she did not properly manage her finances and provided her \ndrug abusing husband with funds rather than pay her bills. She ignored the medical \ndebts for herself and her daughter. While there is sufficient information to show that \nApplicant's husband was a drain on Applicant's finances because of his drug use, \nApplicant has not established that this condition was beyond her control. She admits \nthat it was a mistake to provide him funds in hopes of salvaging their marriage. \nApplicant made a choice, and the circumstances were not out of her control. Her \nhusband's drug use was beyond her control but her decision to provide him with the \nfamily funds, slipping them further into debt, was within her control. When the debts \nmounted, she basically ignored them and thus did not act responsibly. There is a strong \nindication her financial problems are likely to recur because she has only minimal funds \nto meet her present financial obligations and pay past-due debts. The debts cast doubt \non her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  \n \n \nI have considered FC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control). This mitigating condition partially applies. Applicant \nreceived financial counseling starting in July 2009 after she received the SOR. She has \ncontinued to attend financial counseling. However, her financial problems are not under \ncontrol. \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments. An applicant \nis not required to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed. The entirety of \nan applicant\u2019s financial situation and her actions can reasonably be considered in \nevaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of her outstanding \nindebtedness is credible and realistic. Available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a \ndetermination. A reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the \npayment of such debts one at a time. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that she has established a plan to resolve her financial problems and has \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has not paid and is not making payments on her past due financial \nobligations. She contacted creditors to verify her debts. Creditors have verified some of \nthe debts, but Applicant has not yet entered payment plans or made any payments. She \nis still waiting for additional verification. She acknowledges most of the debts only \ndisputing the amount. She knows she owes creditors some amount of money. Knowing \n\n8 \n \nthat she owes creditors has not prompted her to seek or agree to payment plans with \nthe creditors. Applicant's lack of action paying her debts is significant and credible \ninformation to show that she has not acted reasonably under the circumstances.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve he issue). This mitigating condition does not apply. Applicant does not \ndispute she owes the debts. She does dispute the amount owed for the majority of the \ndelinquent debts. The difference in the amounts, however, is not sufficiently significant \nto affect resolving the issues. \n \nApplicant has not acted responsibly towards her debts and finances under the \ncircumstances. Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations because she did not establish that the reasons for \nher debts were beyond her control and that she took reasonable and responsible efforts \nto manage her finances. Her finances indicate a public trust concern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered her husband's drug \nabuse was one of the causes of Applicant's financial problems. I also considered that \nher daughter's medical issues were the basis for some of the medical debts. I \nconsidered that she has not paid her debts, but may now be in a position to start to \nmake payments on some of her past obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has not established a meaningful track record of paying her delinquent \ndebts. She has not made payments on her delinquent debts. She disputes the amount \n\n9 \n \nof the debts but not the debts themselves. She only recently has funds available to \nmake debt payments. At this time, she has not had the opportunity to establish a \nmeaningful track record of debt payments. She has not established that she acted \nreasonably and responsibly towards her finances which indicates she may not act \nreasonably and responsibly to protect sensitive information. In the future, if Applicant is \nable to establish such a meaningful track record of debt payment and reduction, she \nshould be afforded the opportunity to establish eligibility for a position of public trust. \nThe management of her finances indicates she may not be concerned and responsible \nwhen protecting sensitive information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness \nconcerns arising from her financial situation.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f - 1.s \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.u:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.v:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.w  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.x:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.y:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.z - 1.dd  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ee:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ff - 1.hh:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.ii:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.jj - 1.nn:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.oo:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

This claim is not viable. Applicant also argues that the evidence in mitigation mandates a favorable case outcome under both Guidelines F and E. Applicant has not established error. The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq. and Stephanie Mendez, Esq.\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 27, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On October 29, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mary E. Henry denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (1) whether the Judge considered all the\nrecord evidence; and (2) whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nFor the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s unfavorable decision. \nThe Judge found that Applicant has experienced financial difficulties since 2003.  He has\naccumulated significant delinquent debt which he has not paid.  His financial problems appear to be\nworsening, despite the fact that he has returned to work after being laid off for a year.  Applicant\ndoes not have a track record of debt repayment.  Applicant knew about his financial problems when\nhe completed his security clearance application, but was not forthright in his answers.  The Judge\nconcluded that neither Applicant\u2019s financial problems nor his lack of candor were mitigated.\nAfter the hearing, the Judge left the record open to allow Applicant to submit additional\ndocumentary evidence.  Applicant subsequently made a large submission containing 16 documents.\nApplicant argues that the Judge did not consider this evidence when deciding the case.  Applicant\nhas failed to establish that the Judge erred. \nApplicant cites various matters in the record that he asserts provide mitigation of the\ngovernment\u2019s concerns, and claims that the Judge could not have reached the conclusions she did\ngiven the state of the evidence contained in the post-hearing submission.  There is a rebuttable\npresumption that a Judge has considered the entirety of the record evidence unless he or she indicates\notherwise.  That presumption is not overcome here.  A review of the post-hearing submission and\nthe Judge\u2019s decision reveals that (a) the Judge specifically references substantive matters contained\nin documents included in the post-hearing submission; and (b) the Judge\u2019s findings of fact contain\nfootnoted references to specific portions of the record, a number of which are accurately identified\nas documents in the post-hearing submission.  In addition to his contentions regarding the Judge\u2019s\nfailure to consider his post-hearing submission,  Applicant also argues more broadly that the Judge\ndid not consider favorable evidence submitted by Applicant prior to his post-hearing submission\u2013\nessentially all the mitigating evidence submitted by Applicant in the case.  This claim is not viable.\n \nApplicant also argues that the evidence in mitigation mandates a favorable case outcome\nunder both Guidelines F and E.  Applicant has not established error.  The presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at\n2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or\nan ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the\n\n3\nJudge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct and considered the possible application of relevant\nconditions and factors.  She discussed the applicability of Guideline F Mitigating Conditions and\ncogently explained why there was insufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s security\nconcerns, stressing the facts that Applicant\u2019s debts are of a longstanding nature and he has yet to take\nmeaningful steps to address them.  The Judge also discussed why the Guideline E mitigating\nconditions could not be applied in Applicant\u2019s favor to overcome the concerns raised by his lack of\ntruthfulness in completing his security clearance application.  \nThe Board does not review a case de novo.  The favorable evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No. 06-11172 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 4, 2007).  After reviewing the record, the Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nher decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d Motor\nVehicle Mfrs.

In 1987, he started a new ministry in a low income area of a local community.\nHe aspired to help young people finish high school, go to college and better themselves.\nAt this same time and in this community, he established a church under the auspices of\na church headquartered out of state. He initially worked as a volunteer pastor. He\nreceived financial compensation for his duties as a minister in this church from 1993 to\n2002. The local church owned property, which is for sale.5\nWhile working in the community, Applicant became aware of other needs of the\nyouth in his community, including child care for young working parents. He set up a non-\nprofit corporation and became its president.  He received no income from this\n6\nbusiness.  The business developed funding problems. Over the years, Applicant used\n7\nhis personal funds to pay some of the business expenses. In 1999, this business\nnotified the state that it was inactive and the documents of record do not show the\nbusiness notified the state that it was active at a later date. In 2002, an attorney\nprepared papers for a business reorganization plan under Chapter 11 of the United\nStates Bankruptcy Code. The record evidence does not reflect whether these papers\nwere filed with the court. By 2004, this business closed its doors. The business filed\nfederal and state tax returns as a corporation with Applicant\u2019s name listed as the\ncontact. The business filed a tax return for the year 2004. Applicant stated that the\nproceeds from the sale of the church property will go to his non-profit business.8\nIn 2006, Applicant began a new ministry. He works part-time as a volunteer\npastor in this church. He does not receive a salary.9\nApplicant\u2019s wife operates a beauty shop business. At times, he has provided her\nwith money to operate her business.  \n10\nApplicant\u2019s financial troubles began sometime prior to 2003. He could not make\nhis mortgage payments and in 2003, his mortgage lender started foreclosure\nproceedings on his property. His wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on June 24,\n2003.  On November 8, 2005, the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss his\n11\nwife\u2019s case for \u201cmaterial default\u201d (not defined).

They used the proceeds from their refinanced mortgage to pay\nbills as listed in the settlement documents and late fee charges to their mortgagor.\nApplicant obtained new employment in July 2007.13\nSince refinancing his house, Applicant made three mortgage payments. His\nmortgage lender notified him that it intended to start foreclosure proceedings and did so\nin June 2009. Applicant contacted legal counsel in March 2009 about the foreclosure\nand his mortgage. He did not provide information which indicated he retained counsel.\nHis wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on July 9, 2009, which stopped the foreclosure\nproceedings.14\nAfter reviewing the credit reports dated September 3, 1999; March 13, 2008;\nOctober 1, 2008;  March 4, 2009; June 15, 2009; and the SOR, I have compiled a list of\nthe total debts owed, excluding any duplicate entries.

At\nthe hearing, he provided a list of debts he believed this service would help resolve,\nwhich did not include the five debts on which he made a $25 payment. After the\nhearing, Applicant provided a document from a different debt counseling service. This\ndocument listed fewer debts to be repaid. Applicant did not provide any proof that he\nmade the first payment of $217 due on August 1, 2009.  \n19\nWith the assistance of a third financial counseling service, Applicant and his wife\ndeveloped a budget. His budget indicated that household monthly income totaled\n$5,604 and household monthly expenses totaled $5,228 plus variable monthly\nexpenses of $198, leaving a monthly surplus of $178. Applicant\u2019s repayment plan cost\nis not included in his monthly expenses. Likewise, the $1,495 house payment is lower\nthan the payments listed in his mortgage loan refinance papers. Applicant and his wife\nreceived a federal income tax refund of $7,324.00 in April 2009. The Internal Revenue\nService applied the refund to an existing tax debt for the year 2001.20\nApplicant challenged the action filed against him by the judgment creditor in SOR\nallegation \u00b6 1.p. He appeared in court to argue his case and appealed the judgment\nentered against him. The court appeal record indicated that the sheriff served Applicant\nwith a copy of the appeal papers on March 10, 2008. On February 6, 2009, the court\nentered a Default Judgment against Applicant and sent a notice of the judgment by\nregular mail to Applicant.  \n21\nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance application on March 7, 2008,\nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to the following questions:\nSection 27: Your Financial Record\nc.\nIn the last 7 years, have you had a lien placed against your\nproperty for failing to pay taxes or other debts?\nd.\nIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you\nthat have not been paid?\n\nTr. 54, 80-82, 85-87.\n22\nId. 83-84.\n23\nId. 54, 68-69.\n24\n7\nApplicant does not owe any state taxes on his personal income and filed his state\ntaxes as required. Because the tax lien related to his non-profit business, not his\npersonal taxes, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 27c. He explained that the lien was filed\nfor withholding taxes due to the state for salaries paid to employees of his non-profit\nbusiness. Several years ago he verbally disputed this lien with the state. He did not list\nthe judgment entered him against because he believed that he did not receive notice of\nthe judgment until after he completed his security clearance application. The court\ndocket sheet indicated that the notice of entry of judgment was mailed to Applicant on\nFebruary 6, 2009. He did not recall receiving notice of the judgment and does not know\nwhen he appeared in court for the case, leading to his judgment.22\nApplicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to the following questions when he completed his\nsecurity, but did not list all his delinquent debts:\nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies\na.\nIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent\non any debt(s)?\nb.\nAre you currently over 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\nApplicant did not have a credit report at the time he completed his security\nclearance application and did not know what debts were over 180 days past due. He\ninitially indicated that does not know why he said \u201cno\u201d about his debts 90 days past due,\nbut on cross-examination, stated that he did not have his credit report.23\nFinally, Section 11, Your Employment Activities, requests Applicant to list all his\nemployment, including full-time and part-time employment and other paid employment.\nWhen he answered this question, Applicant listed his full-time jobs for the last seven\nyears, but he did not list his part-time employment as a minister. He started his ministry\nand pastoral work as a volunteer, then received a salary from 1993 until at least 2002.\nAfter 2002, his salary declined and he eventually declined to accept a salary from his\nchurch members. He occasionally received a stipend from his church members.  \n24\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n8\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nan applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\n9\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has a long history of financial problems. He accumulated\nsignificant delinquent debt, which he has not paid. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose sometime ago and continue to the present. Thus, this potentially\nmitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant lost his job in\n2006 and remained unemployed for over one year. During his unemployment, he and\nhis wife refinanced their home, indicating sufficient income to receive loan approval.\nApplicant has not provided any information which shows that he acted reasonably\ntowards his other debts when he was unemployed. This mitigating condition does not\napply in this case. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant contacted a debt counseling service\none week before the hearing. Since the hearing, he contacted two other debt counseling\nservices. Through one service, he developed a repayment plan for five debts on which\nhe had not made any previous payments. He did not provide evidence that he paid the\nfirst payment. Given his long history of unpaid debt, there is a serious concern that he\nwill not comply with his repayment plan. In addition, the budget he developed indicated\nthat he lacks sufficient funds each month to make his agreed upon payments. Applicant\nhas not provided sufficient evidence to show that he has mitigated the government\u2019s\nsecurity concerns even with his financial counseling.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant made\n\n10\nfive one-time $25 payments on five small debts. These payments are insufficient to\nestablish a good-faith effort to resolve either these debts or his other significant debts.\nThe remaining balance on these debts and many other debts are unpaid. I conclude\nthat this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue\u201d may apply in this case to some debts. Applicant challenged the validity of the\nthree medical bills in SOR allegations 1.d, 1.h, and 1.k. As a result of his challenge, the\ncredit reporting agency deleted these debts. This mitigating condition applies to these\nthree debts and the debt listed in SOR allegation 1.l, as it is the same as the debt in\nSOR allegation 1.d. This mitigating condition does not apply to the debt in 1.s, which\nApplicant disputed at the hearing. Applicant has not filed a formal dispute with either the\ncreditor or the credit reporting agencies. \nAG \u00b6 20(f) mitigating condition, \u201cthe affluence resulted from a legal source of\nincome,\u201d is not applicable in this case.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying in this case:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor AG DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in\nhis answer must be deliberate. The government established that Applicant omitted\nmaterial facts from his e-QIP when he answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions about liens and\njudgments and when he failed to list all his debts and his employment as a minister.\nThis information is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a\nsecurity clearance and to his honesty. In his response to the SOR and at the hearing,\nApplicant denied, however, that he had an intent to hide this information from the\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n25\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\nDefault judgments are entered against parties who do not appear for court proceedings as required.\n26\n11\ngovernment. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an omission, standing alone,\ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission\noccurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\nintent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.25\nApplicant believed that he did not need to list the state tax lien because it related\nto withholding taxes from his non-profit business and not his personal income taxes. He\ndenies owing these taxes on the grounds that the taxes are owed by his now defunct\nnon-profit business. His documents show that the business was a corporation and he\nwas the contact person. Although the lien is filed against him, his understanding that the\nlien belongs to his non-profit business is reasonable and supported by the documents.\nSOR allegation 2.b is found in his favor. Regarding his failure to list the judgment, the\ncourt entered a default judgment  against Applicant in February 2009 following an\n26\nappeal. While Applicant may not have received a final determination on his appeal by\nthe time he completed his e-QIP, he knew that a judgment had been entered against\nhim at least one year earlier and that he had not paid it. His failure to list the judgment\nwas intentional. SOR allegation 2.c is found against Applicant. \nConcerning his failure to list his multiple debts, Applicant had a duty to at least\nadvise the government that he had other delinquent debts. While he answered \u201cyes\u201d to\nSection 28, questions a and b, his listing of one debt and failure to, at least, admit\ngenerally to the existence of other debts established that he attempted to minimize his\ndebt problems, an action that was intentional. SOR allegations 2.d and 2.e are found\nagainst Applicant.\nFinally, Applicant\u2019s failure to list his part-time employment is not an intentional\nact, but carelessness on his part. SOR allegation 1.a is found in favor of Applicant.\nI have reviewed the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17, and find that none apply\nin this case.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\n12\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe evidence in support of denying a security clearance to applicant under the\nwhole person concept is more substantial than the evidence in support of granting or\nreinstating his security clearance. Applicant has held a security clearance without any\nviolations for many years. In reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially\ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, supra, in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s desire and efforts to provide\nguidance and support to young people through his church is commendable and\nlaudable. Unfortunately, he received little financial support from outside sources to\nachieve his goal. He used his personal income to support his church to his financial\ndetriment. \nApplicant has a long history of financial difficulties, which appear to be\nworsening. He was unemployed from his full-time job for one year, but has been\nworking for more than two years. His financial problems continued to deteriorate after\nhe returned to work. He contacted a financial counselor one week before the hearing.\nAfter the hearing, he developed a payment plan for five debts with another financial\ncounselor, but has not yet made a  payment under this plan. He does not have a track\nrecord for debt payment. His new budget does not provide money to repay his old\ndebts. His financial issues are significant and not being resolved. Applicant knew about\nhis financial problems when he completed his security clearance application, but was\nnot forthright in his answers.  He failed to be honest about his debts when completing\nhis security clearance application, conduct which raises concerns about his\ntrustworthiness and judgment.\n\n13\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his finances and personal\nconduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n14\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Janovsky, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was indicted for Indecency - Fondling of a neighbor child and pled\nguilty to Injury to a Child - Bodily Injury, both felonies. He initially denied any\nwrongdoing, but has now admitted his guilt to his Sex Offender Treatment Providers. He\nis still undergoing court-ordered therapy and will remain on supervised probation subject\nto further deferred sentencing until April 2017. Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is revoked and\ndenied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on August 14, 2006.  On\n1\nMarch 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nJ (Criminal Conduct), D (Sexual Behavior), and E (Personal Conduct).  The action was\n2\ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\nSeptember 16, 2009\n\nItem 3.\n3\nThe Government submitted 11 items in support of the SOR allegations.\n4\nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted five documents in support of her discussion and arguments.\n5\nItem 4 at 1, 5, 19; AFORM at 2.\n6\nItem 5.\n7\n2\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 27, 2009, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.3\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on May 28, 2009. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n4\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his copy of the FORM\non July 16, 2009, and returned it to DOHA. On August 14, 2009, through counsel, he\nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s File of Relevant Materials (AFORM),  which contained no\n5\nobjection to consideration of any evidence submitted by Department Counsel. On\nAugust 17, 2009, Department Counsel initialed a memorandum to indicate that he did\nnot object to the admissibility into evidence and consideration of the materials submitted\nby Applicant. I received the case assignment on August 25, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has\nworked since 1989, and held a security clearance since 1991. He is married with two\nchildren, ages 13 and 11.  In his response to the SOR, he admitted in part and denied in\n6\npart each allegation. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his response\nto interrogatories,  are incorporated in the following findings.\n7\nIn September 2005, an 11-year-old neighbor girl reported to a school counselor\nthat Applicant had touched her in a way that made her very uncomfortable. In\nsubsequent interviews with Child Protective Services and police personnel, she\ndescribed an incident several years earlier during which Applicant fondled her vaginal\narea under her clothes after he invited her and his two children to lie on his bed with\nhim, under a sheet, and watch a movie. She said that she immediately got out of the\nbed and went home, but did not tell her parents or anyone else at the time. She\nsubsequently told a couple friends, one of whom encouraged her to tell the counselor\n\nItems 6 and 7.\n8\nItem 6 at 1; Item 3 at 2; Item 8.\n9\nItem 4 at 15-17.\n10\nItem 3 at 2; Items 9, 10, 11; AFORM Documents 3 and 4.\n11\n3\nwhat had happened. She also said he fondled her on a second occasion, but her\ndescription of that event was inconsistent during different interviews.  \n8\nOn October 14, 2005, a magistrate issued an arrest warrant for Applicant on the\ncharge of Indecency with a Child-Sexual Contact. Applicant surrendered to the sheriff\u2019s\ndepartment and was released on $5,000 bond later the same day. During April 2006, a\ngrand jury indicted him on a second degree felony charge of Indecency - Fondling,\nalleging that on or about January 1, 2003, he intentionally engaged in sexual contact\nwith the girl with the intent to arouse or gratify his sexual desires.  \n9\nApplicant reported this charge in response to question 23 on his security\nclearance application which he signed and certified to be true on August 14, 2006. He\nlisted the date of the offense as \u201c10/2005 (Estimated).\u201d He further stated, \u201cPresently I\nam fighting this in court with a lawyer,\u201d and \u201cI am not guilty of this offense. I am vigorisly\n[sic] fighting this in court. If you need more information, you would have to speak with\nmy lawyer.\u201d10\nOn April 7, 2007, pursuant to a plea agreement, Applicant pled guilty to the\noffense of Injury to a Child - Bodily Injury, a third degree felony that did not require him\nto register as a sex offender. The offense date was recorded as January 1, 2003.\nImposition of the standard sentence of two to ten years in the state penitentiary was\ndeferred and suspended for a period of ten years of supervised probation. Applicant\nwas ordered to pay a fine of $1,000, court costs of $263, and $60 per month in\nprobation fees. He was ordered to have no contact with the victim, and no unsupervised\ncontact with any child under age 17, including his own children. He was further ordered\nto undergo a sex offender evaluation and any programs recommended as a result of the\nevaluation.11\nOn January 29, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the\nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He told the investigator that he pled guilty\nbecause he thought it was the right thing to do for himself and his family. He repeatedly\nstated that he had done nothing wrong, had not fondled the girl, and was falsely\naccused but settled for a plea agreement rather than risk having to go to jail and register\nas a sex offender. He said he was not subject to pressure or coercion because his\nfamily and some co-workers and friends knew about the allegations and his arrest. He\nhad not told his boss about the arrest, but had kept his company\u2019s security office\ninformed. He expressed his concern that he could lose his security clearance and his\njob as a result of being falsely accused and accepting a plea agreement. On January\n13, 2009, in response to DOHA Interrogatories, Applicant said that the investigator\n\nItem 5.\n12\nItem 3 at 1-5, 4.\n13\nAFORM Document 1.\n14\n4\nincorrectly identified the offense to which he pled guilty as a misdemeanor, when in fact\nit was a third degree felony. Subject to that change, he subscribed under oath that the\ninterview report was accurate.  \n12\nIn his April 27, 2009, response to the SOR, Applicant never directly admitted or\ndenied having committed the offenses for which he did admit that he was arrested,\ncharged, and convicted after pleading guilty. He reasserted that he pled guilty for the\nbest interest of his family, to avoid the stress and financial burden of a trial, to receive a\nfavorable sentence with no jail time, and to eliminate the risk of having to register as a\nsex offender. In his response to the Guideline E allegation, however, he said, \u201cI deny\nthat I have failed to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance\nprocess. I deny that I have failed to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d13\nRead as a whole, Applicant\u2019s SOR response never contradicts his previous denials of\nfondling or otherwise assaulting the neighbor girl, and asserts that those denials were\ntruthful.\nAs a result of his court-ordered sex offender evaluation, Applicant entered a sex\noffender treatment program with a Licensed Sex Offender Treatment Provider in June\nor July of 2007. This counselor reported that Applicant has shown progression in\ntreatment for more than 25 months. As of August 2009, his \u201ctreatment plan is more than\napproximately 2/3 completed with an ongoing good rating.\u201d The counselor further\nreported, \u201cDue to shame and guilt, [Applicant] initially denied his offense but later\nretracted this denial and has been continuously remorseful.\u201d Applicant \u201cadmitted his\ncrime and is being rehabilitated,\u201d and \u201cidentified his obsessions, cycle of abuse, and\nthinking errors that led to his misbehaviors [sic].\u201d The counselor did not identify any\ndetails of the offense or offenses which Applicant admitted to him. However, based on\nhis evaluation that Applicant \u201chas been a good family man,\u201d has held a security\nclearance \u201cfor more than 21 years,\u201d and \u201cappears to make his country, family, and his\nemployer uncompromising priorities in his life,\u201d the counselor opined that Applicant\n\u201cprojects little or no threat to the defense of the United States,\u201d and \u201cshould maintain his\nsecurity clearance at this time.\u201d  \n14\nIn September 2008, Applicant underwent an evaluation of his treatment progress\nby a different Licensed Sex Offender Treatment Provider in connection with his\nattorney\u2019s request for the court to permit him unsupervised contact with his own\nchildren. After extensive testing, contact, and evaluation, this second Provider\nconcluded that he was receiving an excellent course of treatment and recommended\nthat the court order be modified to permit unsupervised contact with his children. The\ncourt accepted this recommendation and modified the order. This Provider reviewed the\ncounselor\u2019s statements and conclusions discussed in the preceding paragraph, and\nexpressed his agreement. He offered additional observations, including:\n\nAFORM Document 2.\n15\n5\nAlthough [Applicant] demonstrated considerable self-consternation and\nshame for having committed the act and not admitting culpability to [his\ncounselor] sooner, he told me the truth regarding his act. He took full\nresponsibility for his actions and was demonstrating progress in his\nrecovery program. . . . [Applicant\u2019s] lack of boasting [about the nature of\nhis work], his genuine remorse and assumption of full responsibility for his\nactions indicate he is free of any personality disorder. This factor alone\ncontributes to his ability to work with and maintain secret information. . . .\nThe fact that [Applicant] did not immediately admit his guilt is not clinically\nsignificant. Early statements of denial are common when treating\noffenders. Apparently [counselor] understands and applied these\nprinciples; was able to achieve a breakthrough with [Applicant] when less\nskilled therapists may have given up, and [Applicant\u2019s] value as a trusted\nemployee were [sic] in turn enhanced. . . . All of the mitigating\ncircumstances of [Applicant\u2019s] initial denial and eventual full admission\nspeak well for his long-time prognosis. Now that all of the details of his\ncase are fully known, there is little likelihood he could be intimidated or\notherwise enticed to reveal national secrets. I have conducted a forensic\npractice for more than thirty-sever [sic] years and, in my opinion,\n[Applicant] is well on his way to recovery and is worthy of working within a\nplace of trust and responsibility.15\nNeither of Applicant\u2019s counselors\u2019 letters, nor anything else submitted by Applicant in\nconnection with these proceedings, identify what misconduct he now admits, or to\nwhom except these counselors he has admitted it. There is no evidence that either his\nsupervisors at work or his family members have been told of these admissions, or what\ntheir resulting level of trust in his judgment, self-control, and reliability may be. \nApplicant submitted no evidence concerning the quality of his professional\nperformance, the level of responsibility his duties entail, or his track record with respect\nto classified information and observation of security procedures. Other than the\naforementioned letters from the sex-offender counselors, he submitted no character\nreferences or other evidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or\nreliability. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person\nsince he elected to have his case decided without a hearing.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions (DCs) and mitigating conditions (MCs), which are to\nbe used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n6\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under this guideline:\nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\n\n7\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\nFor some unexplained reason, Department Counsel did not address Guideline D\nwhatsoever in the FORM. Applicant\u2019s counsel, understandably, did not mention it either\nin her response to the FORM. Since Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7 requires that Department\nCounsel provide Applicant \u201ca copy of all relevant and material information that could be\nadduced at a hearing,\u201d and 30 days in which to respond with \u201cobjections, rebuttal,\nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation, as appropriate,\u201d I have determined that this\nconstitutes a withdrawal or abandonment by the Government of the SOR \u00b6 2 allegation\nof Guideline D concerns. The actual SOR allegation does not assert any actual sexual\nbehavior on Applicant\u2019s part, as required under the wording of each AG \u00b6 13 DC, but\nmerely asserts that he was charged with a sex offense, resulting in his arrest. The\nreference to SOR \u00b6 1.a. incorporates his being charged with a sex offense, but\nconvicted of an offense that does not necessarily involve any sexual behavior. \n\n8\nEven had Guideline D concerns been properly pled and asserted by Department\nCounsel as supporting security concerns, adjudication under this guideline would have\nbeen multiplicious and redundant with analogous security concerns, DCs, and MCs\nunder Guidelines E and J below. AG \u00b6 13(b) concerns are neither alleged nor supported\nin this record. AG \u00b6 13(a)-related security concerns are comprehensively addressed\nunder Guideline J. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(c) and (d) concerns about judgment and vulnerability to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress are fully addressed under Guideline E. Potentially\napplicable MCs in AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and (c) have analogous provisions under Guidelines J\nand E, so Applicant is not harmed by adjudication under those guidelines in lieu of this\none. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(a) and (d) have no factual basis in this case. Accordingly, I conclude that\ndue process does not require reopening the record for additional evidence or argument\nconcerning Guideline D.\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying (DCs). The three Criminal Conduct DCs raised by the\nevidence are, \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d \u201c(c) allegation or\nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged,\nformally prosecuted, or convicted;\u201d and \u201c(d) the individual is currently on parole or\nprobation.\u201d\nApplicant was arrested and indicted for sexually fondling a neighbor girl who was\na friend of his children and eight to ten years old at the time. He pled guilty to a lesser\noffense of Injury to a Child - Bodily Injury. This was still a felony offense, with a standard\nsentencing range of two to ten years in prison, which is deferred while he serves ten\nyears of supervised probation. He eventually admitted his full culpability to his Sex\nOffender Treatment Program counselors, although he has not revealed those details in\nconnection with this adjudication. These facts fully support security concerns under the\nDCs set forth in AG \u00b6 31(a) (based on his felony conviction); \u00b6 31(c) (based on his guilty\nplea to a third degree felony, his child-victim\u2019s allegation of, and subsequent indictment\nand prosecution for, a second degree felony); and \u00b6 31(d) (based on his current\nsupervised probation that will continue until April 2017). \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MCs). These\nare: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n\n9\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant did not assert that the MCs set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), (b), and (c) apply\nin his case. I have independently considered the potential applicability of each of them,\nand conclude that they supply no mitigation on this record. Neither the time since\nApplicant\u2019s crime nor the circumstances surrounding it make it unlikely to recur or\nalleviate resulting concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. He was\nunder no pressure or coercion to abuse this child. He did assert on his August 2006\nsecurity clearance application and during his OPM interview (conducted in January\n2008 and verified to be true under oath in January 2009), that he was falsely accused\nand had done nothing wrong. However, these statements are uncorroborated, and are\ncontradicted by his guilty plea and conviction of a felonious touching of the child who he\nwas indicted for indecently fondling. His denials are further contradicted by his full\nadmission of his criminal conduct to his two counselors.   \nApplicant asserts that the evidence supports mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(d). After\nmore than 25 months, Applicant has only completed about 2/3 of his court-ordered sex\noffender treatment plan, however. His counselors place great significance on his\neventual acknowledgment and full disclosure of his criminal sexual conduct as\ndemonstrating his remorse and rehabilitation. However, Applicant made no showing that\nhe has acknowledged or disclosed that information to his family or professional\nassociates, and consistently evaded every opportunity to admit it in connection with the\ninvestigation and adjudication of his security clearance eligibility. Finally, his ongoing\nsupervised probation, with conditional suspension of substantial imprisonment until\n2017, weakens the probative weight of the absence of additional criminal conduct in\nestablishing rehabilitation. He paid his fines, but made no showing of restitution or other\nexpression of remorse to his victim or his family. Similarly, he provided no evidence of a\ngood employment record or constructive community involvement. The mitigation\nestablished by rehabilitation evidence to date is minimal.\n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\n\n10\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying under this guideline. Department Counsel mentioned \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16(d). The \u201cwhole-person\u201d analysis will be addressed below. The\nspecific Guideline E concerns raised by the SOR allegation include:\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group; \nand the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness issues the Appeal Board has found to\nbe inherent under AG \u00b6 15.\nApplicant\u2019s crime against a neighbor child and concealment of his true culpability\nfrom others whose knowledge of it would adversely affect his personal, professional,\nand community standing, create ongoing vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and\nduress. He physically abused a young friend of his own children. This girl was entrusted\nto his care and supervision by her parents, who were neighbors and family friends. This\nbreach of trust and confidence raises serious concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security\nconcerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n\n11\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\n \nApplicant asserted that his acknowledgment of his criminal conduct and\nparticipation in weekly counseling provide mitigation of concerns over his\ntrustworthiness, reliability, and inappropriate behavior under MC 17(d) above. He claims\nfurther mitigation under MC 17(e) based on his counseling and supervision by his\nprobation officer and sex offender treatment program, his acknowledgment of his past\noffense, and the absence of subsequent misconduct. Applicant\u2019s position has merit, in\nthat successful completion of these remedial measures will reduce the personal conduct\nsecurity concerns discussed above. The mitigating effect of his commendable progress\nto date is insufficient to completely alleviate those concerns, and he failed to\ndemonstrate full acknowledgment and disclosure of his offense to all concerned parties.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.     \n\n12\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature\nindividual who is responsible for his entirely voluntary choices and conduct that underlie\nsecurity concerns expressed in the SOR. He engaged in felonious abuse of a young\nchild who trusted him as a family friend. He was convicted of Injury to a Child - Bodily\nInjury, and is serving ten years of supervised probation that will continue until 2017. He\nhas successfully completed part of his court-ordered sex offender treatment program.\nHis motivation for the conduct was his personal gratification. He did not disclose this\nactivity to significant people in his life or on his most recent security clearance\napplication, and accordingly remains subject to duress. The record contains insufficient\nother evidence about his character or responsibility to mitigate these concerns, or\ntending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from criminal conduct and\npersonal conduct considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 2.a:\nWithdrawn\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is\nrevoked and denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\n1\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines\nMarch 30, 2010\n\n2\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nDOHA received Applicant\u2019s SOR answer on October 19, 2009. He admitted the\nsole allegation, SOR subparagraph 1.a, alleged under the Sexual Behavior guideline,\nbut denied it, as cross-alleged under the Personal Conduct guideline in Paragraph 2.\nApplicant requested a determination based on the record instead of a hearing.\nOn October 29, 2009, Department Counsel requested a hearing. On December\n7, 2009, I received the case assignment. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nDecember 16, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on January 8, 2010.\nDuring the hearing, I received four Government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony.\nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 15, 2010. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old married man with no children. He has a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in political science. For the past four years, he has worked as a consultant and\nbusiness analyst for a military health information system (Tr. 15). His tasks include,\namong other things, performing requirements analyses and evaluations supporting\nvarious health information management systems (Answer at 22). According to his\nsupervisor, he is \u201can excellent team member [who is] knowledgeable, reliable, assertive,\n[and] prepared\u201d (Answer at 10). \nOn October 20, 2004, while away on business travel, Applicant called his wife to\nask her to retrieve some information from his password-protected, home desktop\ncomputer (Government Exhibit (GE) 4 at 1). When Applicant\u2019s wife logged onto his\ncomputer, she discovered multiple pornographic images. Ten to twelve of them\ndepicted children (Id.).\nApplicant\u2019s wife contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who initiated\nan investigation the following week. On November 29, 2004, after Applicant returned\nhome, FBI agents interviewed him. He acknowledged subscribing to an online program\nthat downloaded pornographic images to his computer and using the word \u201cteen\u201d in the\nprogram\u2019s search engine (Tr. 24). He initially told the agent that the word \u201cteen\u201d when\nused in the search engine was \u201csupposed to mean older than majority teen\u201d (Tr. 24). He\nthen told the agent he would view the child pornographic images then delete them (Tr.\n28). Eventually, he admitted that he was interested in child pornography (Tr. 30).\nApplicant stated that his interest was mainly of girls between the ages of 15 and\n17 (Tr. 17). When Department Counsel, during cross-examination, asked him if he told\nthe FBI agent that he was interested in prepubescent girls because of its taboo nature,\nApplicant responded, \u201cI think I was more interested in the taboo nature than I was the\nnature\u201d (Tr. 31).\n\n3\nAfter interviewing Applicant, the FBI confiscated his desktop computer (GE 3 at\n7). The investigation concluded in the spring of 2005 (Id. at 8). Applicant was not\nsubject to criminal prosecution. \nApplicant coached girls\u2019 gymnastics for approximately ten years in the 1990s (Tr.\n32). The girls ranged in age from 8 to 18 (GE 4 at 8).\nThe revelation of Applicant\u2019s interest in child pornography nearly destroyed his\nmarriage (Answer at 3). Over the years, he has gradually repaired his marital\nrelationship (Id.). No one other than his wife knows about this conduct (Tr. 32). \nApplicant has not viewed any child pornography since 2004. Applicant has no\nintention of viewing any child pornography in the future. He continues to look at adult\npornography occasionally (Tr. 34).\nApplicant never received psychological counseling (Tr. 33). He spoke with some\npsychologists, but \u201c[n]one of them would take [him] because [h]e was on the road all the\ntime and couldn\u2019t find the schedule with them\u201d (Tr. 33). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability to have access to sensitive information,\nthe administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior\nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or duress can raise\n\n4\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation\u201d (AG \u00b6 12). Applicant\u2019s storage of child pornography on his personal\ncomputer for his sexual gratification triggers the application of AG \u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual\nbehavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted,\u201d and\nAG \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress.\u201d\nThe following mitigating conditions as listed in AG \u00b6 14 are potentially applicable:\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress.\nApplicant has neither downloaded nor viewed any child pornography in more\nthan five years. However, I remain troubled that he never received psychological\ncounseling to address his desire to view child pornography. Without a psychologist\u2019s\nevaluation, his reassurances that the problem will not recur are insufficient to trigger the\napplication of any of the mitigating conditions. \nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability [and] trustworthiness . . .\u201d (AG \u00b6 15). No one else other\nthan Applicant\u2019s wife is aware of his conduct. If known, such behavior could adversely\naffect his professional or community standing. AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to\nexploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as . . . engaging in activities which, if known,\nmay affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing . . .\u201d applies.\nApplicant has not mitigated this Personal Conduct concern for the same reasons\nhe did not mitigate the Sexual Behavior concern.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or eligibility to work in a sensitive position\nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n\n5\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility to work in a\nsensitive position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.\nApplicant deserves credit for his exceptional work performance. He has repaired\nthe relationship with his wife that had been damaged by the revelation of his interest in\nchild pornography, and has not viewed such material in more than five years. These\npositive factors are outweighed by his failure to attend counseling, his piecemeal\ndisclosure to the FBI regarding his child pornography possession, and his effort at the\nhearing to retreat from an earlier statement that he was attracted to prepubescent girls\nbecause of its taboo nature. Under these circumstances, Applicant is an unacceptable\ncandidate for occupying a sensitive position.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n6\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for occupying a\nsensitive position. Eligibility is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On June 8, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 16, 2009 and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge through Counsel. I received the case assignment\non September 18, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 1, 2009, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on October 28, 2009. The government offered\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 12, which were admitted into the record without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf and presented the testimony of his wife. He\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n2\nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A-F, without objection. I held the record open until November 6,\n2009 for Applicant to submit additional character references. He submitted the\nreferences in a timely manner. The documents were marked as AE G, and submitted\ninto the record without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nNovember 5, 2009. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.j,\nand 1.l with explanations. He admitted the other factual allegations in the SOR. He also\nprovided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security\nclearance. \nApplicant is 46 years old. He is married with two adult children. Applicant served\nin the U.S. Air Force from 1981 until 2001, when he retired. He has been employed in\nhis current job since November 2001 (GE 1). Applicant has held a security clearance\nsince 1998. \nApplicant first consumed alcohol at the age of 16. He drank beer with his friends\nduring the summer. His mother abused alcohol during his childhood years. She married\nafter his father died and Applicant was sent to live with his grandparents for a few years.\nWhen Applicant returned to live with his mother, she had remarried again. There was\nphysical and verbal abuse in the home. Applicant assumed responsibility for his family\u2019s\nfinances at the age of 14. He often had to locate her or her husband at a bar and bring\nthem home. He left home to join the military when he was 17 years old.\nApplicant\u2019s drinking habits, while he was in the military from 1981 until 2001,\ninvolved drinking at parties on weekends. He also explained that the military culture\npromoted social drinking with buddies on the weekends. He attended \u201changar parties\u201d\nevery Friday evening which involved heavy drinking (Tr. 63).\nIn 1984, Applicant had an automobile accident while he was driving a rental car.\nHe flipped his car and then decided to walk to a bar and have a mixed drink while\nwaiting for the police to arrive (Tr. 86). He was referred by his command to a social\naction program but the command noted that there was insufficient evidence of problem\ndrinking (GE 8). Applicant recalled that the program was a short seminar on the effects\nof alcohol. \nIn 1990, Applicant was at work and his supervisor suspected alcohol on his\nbreath (GE 10). Applicant had been drinking the night before, but he denied that he had\nconsumed alcohol while at work (Tr. 93). He volunteered to take a blood alcohol test at\nthe time. Applicant is adamant that he never drank at work nor did alcohol ever interfere\nwith his work. He explained that any documentation that he may have had concerning\nthis event which occurred 20 years ago is no longer available, He does remember that\nhe attended an alcohol education program (Tr. 89).\n\n3\nApplicant retired from the military in 2001. He had a difficult transition to civilian\nlife. He explained that he drank frequently and to the point of intoxication. He was under\nstress due to work issues and problems with his two daughters who did not need him as\nmuch as when they were younger (Tr. 95).\nOn June 9, 2002, Applicant attended a bachelor party. He consumed tequila,\nrum, whiskey, and beer over the course of a few hours. While driving home, Applicant\nstruck the rear of an automobile (GE 6). In 2002, Applicant was charged with careless\ndriving, driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), and driving while ability impaired.\nHe was found guilty of Count 1 and the sentence was deferred. He pleaded guilty to\nCount 3 and was sentenced to 24 months of unsupervised probation (GE 6). He was\nordered to attend alcohol education and therapy. Count 2 was dismissed. \nIn 2003, Applicant received court-ordered outpatient treatment for alcohol abuse\nin connection with his conviction for driving while impaired. He describes it as more an\nawareness training or education rather than treatment. He  attended 30 class hours and\nsome Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. He completed all the conditions of his\nprobation (GE 2). \nOn September 8, 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with a DUI and DUI\nPer Se. He pleaded guilty to Count 1 and was sentenced to 18 months probation to\ninclude alcohol therapy. Count 2 was dismissed. Applicant went to a bar and consumed\nthree beers and three alcoholic beverages. He had something to eat and then chose to\ndrive home. He was stopped by the police and admitted to drinking that evening.\nApplicant explained that he was under great stress at the time due to family problems.\nHis one daughter had been in an automobile accident and his other daughter was in an\nabusive marriage (GE 3).\nAs a result of the 2006 DUI, Applicant completed 86 hours of therapy and 96\nhours of community service. He attended AA meetings, and he completed a level II\nalcohol education program. Applicant was ordered to refrain from drinking alcohol for\none year. He was on unsupervised probation until June 2008 (GE 7).\nIn March 2007, Applicant admitted himself into an inpatient treatment program.\nHe wanted to quit drinking. He notified his employer, took time off from work and\ncompleted the program on April 16, 2008. He paid for this program on his own. He\nunderwent a medical evaluation, received counseling, and education treatment. He\navailed himself of a support group and continued his sobriety. Applicant\u2019s diagnosis was\nalcohol dependence (GE 4). He did not drink after that time. Applicant acknowledged\nthat he attended a dinner in 2008 and accidentally picked up someone\u2019s glass. He\nbelieved it was water but when he tasted it, he knew it was wine. He reported that he\nhas not drunk to the point of intoxication since 2007 (Tr. 68).\nApplicant drank a beer before going to an AA meeting in June 2008 (Tr. 43). He\ntold his wife about the incident. He also knew that it would be detected at the meeting.\nHe realized that this was self-destructive behavior (Tr. 70). After that, he decided to use\n\n4\nAntabuse (Tr. 70). Applicant uses Anatabuse whenever he feels stressed. This deters\nhim from drinking alcohol because he gets violently ill if he consumes alcohol while on\nthe medication. He recounted an incident in 2007, when he was on the medication and\nhad a reaction from a sip of beer. Applicant does not frequent bars. He does not keep\nany alcohol in his home.\nApplicant received a favorable prognosis in January 2009 from his counselor who\nis certified as an alcohol abuse counselor. Applicant attends AA several times a week.\nHe is monitored on Antabuse. He has shown great improvement. He has followed his\ncounselor\u2019s recommendations for recovery (GE 2). He has attended family counseling.\nHe looks to his family for support and also the AA members. He is actively working the\nsteps of recovery in AA. He also sought help from the Employee Assistance Program\n(EAP) at work. He told his supervisor at work about his alcohol problem. Applicant has\nearned a one-year coin from AA for his abstinence (AE C).\nApplicant has used an Ignition Interlock Program for a year and a half - since the\nlast DUI (AE A). He wants to keep it in the car indefinitely. The court-ordered period\nexpires in August 2010 (Tr. 73).\nApplicant attends college classes in computer security (AE F). He hopes to\nobtain a degree so that he can improve his skills. He spends time with his family. He\ntalks to his wife about problems instead of isolating himself and drinking (Tr. 65).      \nApplicant is a system administrator for a contractor. He is a trusted, reliable\nprofessional. He adapts to situations and has an excellent working relationship with\ncustomers and colleagues. He is honest and hard working. Applicant is remorseful\nabout his personal issues with alcohol. He is committed to his treatment and has\nadvised his employer about his situation (AE G).  \nApplicant submitted six character references, including two from his daughters.\nHe is described by colleagues as a quality producer. His work ethic is exceptional and\nhe is meticulous in his work. \nApplicant is recommended and considered a valuable asset to the organization.\nHe is efficient, competent and his communication skills are excellent. He is dedicated to\nhis family. In social situations, he has not consumed alcohol.   \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n5\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying, \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent,\u201d and \u201c(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of\nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d\nApplicant has two alcohol-related driving incidents (2002 and 2006).  He admitted\ndriving with impaired judgment due to the alcohol he consumed, and he admitted that\nhe consumed alcohol, at times to excess and to the point of intoxication for many years\nuntil 2007.  Thus, AG \u00b6 22 (a) and (c) apply.\nIn June 2007, Applicant was diagnosed with chronic alcohol dependence by a\nlicensed clinical social worker during the court program. Thus, AG \u00b6 22(e), \u201cevaluation\nof alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW)\nwho is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d applies.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and,\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant has two alcohol-related driving incidents. Since 2006, he has not had\nany other alcohol-related driving incidents. Applicant attended alcohol classes after his\n2002 and 2006 incident. He underwent inpatient treatment in 2007. He has not drunk to\n\n7\nthe point of intoxication since 2007. He has abstained from drinking since drinking one\nbeer in June 2008. He has abstained from drinking and driving for almost three years.\nHe has received counseling and treatment in a court program after the incident in 2006.\nApplicant has acknowledged that he abused alcohol in the past but now he is committed\nto a different life style. Applicant attends AA of his own accord. Applicant maintains that\nhe will not drink in the future. He has received a favorable prognosis from an LCSW. He\ncontinues to receive family counseling whenever necessary. He is monitored on\nAntabuse. He intends to use the ignition interlock system in his car after the court-\nordered time expires in 2010. He attended the EAP program and advised his supervisor\nof his alcohol problem. I considered his promise not to consume alcohol to be candid,\nsincere, and credible. Future alcohol consumption is unlikely to occur. He has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol consumption\nconcerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), (b), and (d).\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative Judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served in the Air Force\nfrom 1981 until his retirement in 2001. Applicant held a secret clearance for many years.\nHe has no incidents or issues with protecting classified information. Applicant has\nexcellent references from his employer. He has been convicted of two alcohol-related\ndriving offenses. Since his most recent offense in 2006, he completed a court-ordered\ntreatment program and stopped his alcohol consumption. He is monitored by Antabuse\nand has an ignition interlock system in his car. He was diagnosed recently by a licensed\nsocial worker with alcohol dependence. He has been abstinent since having one beer in\n2008. He has a good prognosis. He involved himself in AA and uses it for support.\nApplicant has had no other legal problems during his life. He availed himself of the EAP\n\n8\nprogram at work. He has attended family counseling. He has changed his lifestyle and\ninteracts with his wife and daughters in a healthy manner.   \n.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility, judgment, and suitability for a security clearance. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from alcohol\nconsumption. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-l:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Although he admitted the police cited him for assault upon a female, he did not specifically admit that he assaulted a female (Item 4). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 23 years old and has been employed by a government contractor since May 2007 as an intern between college sessions (Item 5).3 From 2001 to 2004, Applicant attended high school. From 2004 to 2007, he attended college. He is not married and does not have any children. Although drug involvement was not cited as a security concern in the SOR, his SF-86 indicates he used marijuana six times during his first year of college. Alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e) Applicant consumed alcohol, occasionally to excess from about 2002, when he was 16 years old, to November 2008.4 During high school, he drank alcohol about once a month and consumed about five beers (Item 6).

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nFrom 2005 to 2008, Applicant was involved in four alcohol-related incidents. He \nfailed to comply with two court orders. He continues to consume alcohol. Applicant \nfailed to mitigate security concerns arising from alcohol consumption and personal \nconduct. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn July 23, 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) for National Security Positions or security clearance \napplication (SF-86) (Item 5). On March 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated \nby the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nAugust 28, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n009. \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges security concerns under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) \nand E (Personal Conduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether Applicant\u2019s \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 21, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 4). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated May 27, 2009, was provided to him, \nand he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.1 Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM. The \ncase was assigned to me on August 7, 2\n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with some \nexplanations and limitations (Item 4). Although he admitted the police cited him for \nassault upon a female, he did not specifically admit that he assaulted a female (Item 4). \nHis admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 23 years old and has been employed by a government contractor \nsince May 2007 as an intern between college sessions (Item 5).3 From 2001 to 2004, \nApplicant attended high school. From 2004 to 2007, he attended college. He is not \nmarried and does not have any children. Although drug involvement was not cited as a \nsecurity concern in the SOR, his SF-86 indicates he used marijuana six times during his \nfirst year of college. \n \nAlcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.e)  \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol, occasionally to excess from about 2002, when he \nwas 16 years old, to November 2008.4 During high school, he drank alcohol about once \na month and consumed about five beers (Item 6). In college he drank about two days \nper week, and he drank about seven beers or two or three mixed drinks (Item 6).   \n \n \n1The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter is dated May 28, 2009; \nand Applicant\u2019s receipt is dated June 2, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had \n30 days after his receipt to submit information. \n \n2Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s SF-86 (Item 5) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n4 This paragraph addresses the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Items 1, 4). SOR \u00b6 1.a generally \ndescribes unremarkable alcohol consumption over a lengthy period without specifically raising any \nalcohol-related disqualifying conditions. Therefore, I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d on page 13, infra. \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nIn April 2005, the police cited Applicant, who was 18 years old, for drinking \nalcohol in public and open container containing alcohol.5 He had consumed two beers \n(Item 6). The court sentenced him to pretrial diversion, 32 hours of community service, a \n$200 fine and ordered him to attend a six-hour alcohol awareness class (Item 6). He \nwas a minor at the time of the citation (Item 5).  \n \nIn November 2007, two months after he completed his SF-86, the police arrested \nApplicant.6 He was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) and \nspeeding. He admitted that prior to his DUI arrest he consumed eight beers and one \nmixed drink (Item 6). He was driving 35 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone (Item \n6). His blood alcohol content was .179 on the first test and .205 on the second (Items 6, \n8). Applicant pleaded no contest to DUI, and the speeding charge was dismissed (Item \n6). The court found him guilty of DUI. The court sentenced him to probation for nine \nmonths (to January 8, 2009), loss of driver\u2019s license for 60 days, a $400 fine, and \nordered him to attend three courses (defensive driving, alcohol awareness, and victim\u2019s \npanel) (Items 6, 8). He had to pay court costs ($44), lab costs ($100), administrative \nfees ($30), probation fees ($225), and drug testing fees ($45) (Item 8). When the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM) investigator interviewed him in June 2008, he had not \ncompleted any of the courses because he moved to a different city in the same state \nwhere he had the DUIs (Item 6). In September 2008, he completed the MADD Victim \nImpact Panel (Item 7). On October 18, 2008, he completed an eight-hour alcohol \neducation course (Item 7). In December 2008, he completed the eight-hour Attitudinal \nDynamic Driving Course (Item 7). \n \nAfter November 2007, he reduced his alcohol use because he wanted to stay out \nof trouble and wanted to obtain a security clearance (Item 6). He reduced his alcohol \nconsumption to about one or two beers about three times per week (Item 6). He does \nnot currently drink alcohol to intoxication (Item 6).    \n \nIn March 2008, the police noticed Applicant was standing outside a bar holding a \ncontainer containing alcohol.7 This conduct violates the law. The police warned \nApplicant about his conduct; however, he was not arrested or charged. Applicant said \nhe was not aware that his conduct violated the law.8 \n  \nIn March 2008, the police arrested Applicant for assaulting a female, who was in \nhis home.9 He had consumed alcohol before the arrest. He explained that he asked a \n \n \n5 This paragraph addresses the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Items 1, 4).  \n  \n6 This paragraph addresses the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.c (Items 1, 4).  \n  \n7 This paragraph addresses the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.d (Items 1, 4).  \n  \n8 I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d on page 13, infra, because Applicant was not aware his conduct was an \noffense. Moreover, the police failure to arrest him is a good indicator of his lack of criminal responsibility.    \n \n9 This paragraph addresses the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e (Items 1, 4).   \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nguest to leave his house, and then pulled her sleeve to get her to the door (Item 7). He \nsaid the officer \u201cagreed this was not a legitimate incident\u201d (Item 7). The police generated \na report, which contained the victim\u2019s description of Applicant\u2019s conduct. She described \nhim as being intoxicated and physically and verbally aggressive towards her (Item 7).  \nThe file does not contain any information contradicting Applicant\u2019s statement that there \nwas no judicial disposition of this allegation.  \n \nPersonal conduct \n \nIn May 2005, the court ordered Applicant to complete community service as part \nof his sentence for drinking alcohol in public and possession of an open container of \nalcohol.10 He failed to complete his court ordered community service as of November \n20, 2008.  \n \nIn April 2008, the court ordered Applicant to \u201cabstain from the possession of and \nuse of alcoholic beverages\u201d for the next six months as part of his sentence for DUI (Item \n8).11 He was aware of this condition of his probation in April 2008 (Items 4, 7). \nNevertheless, he continued to consume alcohol, asserting he did not consume alcohol \nin the county where the order not to consume alcohol was issued (Item 7).   \n \nApplicant has never completed the community service requirement ordered by \nthe court after his April 2005 alcohol-related offense (Item 4). He explained he had not \ncompleted his community service requirement because he moved to a different city in \nthe same state, and could not locate any places where he could perform his community \nservice (Item 6). He received an extension after moving, and then the office responsible \nfor ensuring he completed the community service never contacted him (Item 4). He \nassumed the community service was waived and his case was resolved (Item 4).   \n   \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \n \n10 This paragraph addresses the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.a (Items 1, 4).  \n  \n11 This paragraph addresses the allegations in SOR \u00b6 2.b (Items 1, 4).  \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guidelines G (Alcohol Consumption) and E (Personal Conduct) with \nrespect to the allegations set forth in the SOR. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment \nor the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nSeven Alcohol Consumption disqualifying conditions could raise a security or \ntrustworthiness concern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) - 22(g) \nprovide:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(b) through 22(g) do not apply. He did not consume alcohol at work or \nhave any alcohol-related incidents at work. Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption problem \nwas not diagnosed or evaluated by a qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) or by a licensed clinical social worker. Although he \nattended some alcohol awareness-type classes, he did not receive the benefits of a \nsignificant alcohol treatment program. He was not diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or as \nbeing alcohol dependent. Binge drinking is not defined and may require more significant \nalcohol consumption than Applicant\u2019s. Although Applicant failed to comply with a court \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \norder not to consume alcohol, AG \u00b6 22(g) does not apply because there was no \nallegation in the SOR under \u00b6 1 concerning violation of this court order. \n \nApplicant had four alcohol-related incidents involving police intervention or arrest. \nThe most serious incident was his DUI in November 2007. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies.  \n \n  \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has met its initial burden \nconcerning alcohol consumption security concerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant \nto establish any appropriate mitigating conditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n  \nFour Alcohol Consumption mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) - 22(d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not fully apply. Applicant had four alcohol-related incidents \ninvolving the police from April 2005 to April 2008. When he responded to DOHA \ninterrogatories on November 20, 2008, he said his most recent consumption of alcohol \nwas on November 8, 2008. He described his current alcohol consumption in his SOR \nresponse as enjoying alcohol responsibly and avoidance of legal and personal problems \nresulting from excessive alcohol consumption. His four alcohol-related incidents \ninvolving police intervention are relatively frequent and recent. Without credible \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nevidence of his current rate of alcohol consumption the likelihood of recurrence of \nalcohol-related offenses cannot be sufficiently assessed to mitigate security concerns.  \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show \nmany different permutations. The Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a \nfairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption.12  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) to 23(d) do not fully apply. Applicant did not fully acknowledge or \ncompletely describe his history of alcohol consumption. He did not provide a thorough \ndescription of his current alcohol consumption. Although he was not diagnosed as being \nalcohol dependent, being an alcoholic, or an alcohol abuser, a clearer and more \nforthright description of his past alcohol use would have helped to erase lingering \nconcerns. He may or may not be minimizing his alcohol consumption problem, refusing \nto fully acknowledge the extent of his alcohol consumption problem. Statements from \ncolleagues, friends, or family members about his alcohol consumption would be helpful. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a generally describes his history of alcohol use; however, I specifically find \nApplicant\u2019s descriptions of his history of alcohol use (Items 4, 7) to be accurate. \nApplicant has not completed an alcohol abuse treatment or counseling program. He has \nnot described attendance at any Alcoholic Anonymous meetings. His history of alcohol \nproblems and the lack of evidence of completion of rehabilitation programs exclude \nproviding full mitigating credit under AG \u00b6 23 at this time.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement about reducing his alcohol consumption after his DUI and \nhis current responsible alcohol consumption are positive developments, showing that he \nrecognizes the importance of overcoming his alcohol problems. However, after careful \nconsideration of the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol consumption,13 I conclude \nhis four alcohol-related incidents from 2005 to 2008, and the absence of detailed \ninformation about his current alcohol consumption are significant factors weighing \nagainst mitigating alcohol consumption concerns.  \n   \n \n \n \n12See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007).   \n \n13For example, in ISCR Case No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board \nreversed the administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d  In ISCR Case No. \n05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a \nclearance to an applicant (AB) where AB had several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most \nrecent DUI was in 2000, six years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his \nalcohol consumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol consumption was \nnot responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and capricious. See also ISCR Case No. \n04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving case with most recent alcohol-related incident three \nyears before hearing, and reversing administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment . . . or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes several conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case in regard to providing the SOR allegations: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe SOR alleges two personal conduct allegations. He failed to complete his \ncourt-ordered community service requirements (SOR \u00b6 2.a). He failed to comply with a \ncourt-order, which required him to abstain from alcohol consumption for six months \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b).  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(1) both apply because the record contains substantial \nevidence that Applicant engaged in actions showing questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, and unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 16(d)(3) applies because he violated court orders, which are rules. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) \napplies. His excessive alcohol consumption creates a vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress because it is an activity, which adversely affects his personal, \nprofessional, and community standing. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(b) do not apply because there are no allegations Applicant \nfalsified a security document or failed to cooperate with a security investigation. AG \u00b6 \n17(c) does not apply. His failures to comply with court orders are not minor offenses. \nHis failure to complete his community service is an ongoing rule violation. His \nconsumption of alcohol in violation of a court order occurred in 2008, which is relatively \nrecent. Because there are multiple violations, the offenses are not \u201cisolated.\u201d The \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence requires consideration of all such offenses in a non-\npiecemeal fashion. The Judge is required to evaluate the record evidence as a whole \nand reach a reasonable conclusion as to the recency of his conduct. ISCR Case No. 03-\n02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n26, 2004)). These rule violations continue to cause doubt about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.        \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d), 17(e), and 17(g) have some application, but do not apply to a \nsufficient degree to mitigate all security concerns under Guideline E. There are some \npositive signs of Applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. He admitted the four alcohol-related \nincidents. He said he was currently drinking alcohol responsibly. No allegations of \nproblems at his employment have surfaced. He received job training, attended college, \nand has a good employment record. These are important factors showing some \nrehabilitation. His security manager is well aware of his alcohol abuse problems. \nDisclosure of his alcohol abuse has reduced his vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply. He admitted his rule violations, and the rule violations \nare established.   \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with court orders shows a significant lapse \nin judgment. After he received the SOR, he should have immediately contacted the \ncourt and resolved the issue of completion of his court-ordered community service. After \nhe received the FORM, he was again informed that the failure to complete his \ncommunity service was a security concern. His failure to take timely, aggressive action \nto resolve this security concern is too recent and serious to be mitigated at this time.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nThere is some evidence supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance. Applicant \nis relatively young and immature. He knows the consequences of excessive alcohol \nconsumption. Applicant contributes to his company and the Department of Defense. \nThere is no evidence at work of any other disciplinary problems. There is no evidence of \ndisloyalty or that he would intentionally violate national security. His character and good \nwork performance show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. His \nsupervisors evidently support him or he would not have been able to retain his \nemployment after his security clearance was called into question.   \n \nThe evidence against approval of Applicant\u2019s clearance is more substantial.  \nApplicant had a problem with alcohol use beginning with his alcohol consumption as a \nminor. Although he received some alcohol awareness classes, he has not received \nalcohol counseling or treatment. He continues to consume alcohol. In 2008, the court \nordered him to abstain from alcohol consumption; however, he continued to consume \nalcohol during the six month probation period. He continues to consume alcohol, and \ndid not provide detailed information about his current alcohol consumption. In 2005, the \ncourt ordered him to perform community service. He did not perform the community \nservice. Applicant received the SOR and FORM, which informed him of the security \nconcern relating to his failure to resolve the issue of performing community service. \nApplicant did not provide proof that he either performed the community service or the \ncourt decided to waive this requirement. His actions show a lack of judgment in the \ncontext of security requirements. Such conduct raises a serious security concern, and a \nsecurity clearance is not warranted. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude he has not mitigated the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption \nand personal conduct.     \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d14 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n14See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 15, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 6, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges security \n \n1 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \nJune 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nconcerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations), and E (Personal Conduct). \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nOn February 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of \nthe file of relevant material (FORM), dated March 17, 2009, was provided to him, and he \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.2 Applicant did not submit any information within the 30-day \ntime period after receiving a copy of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on June \n18, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old Training and Doctrine Specialist, who has worked for \nhis government contractor employer since October 2004.3 He served in the U.S. Army \nas an enlisted person from November 1996 to September 2004.

The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n2 DOHA transmittal letter is dated March 19, 2009; and Applicant received the FORM on March \n31, 2009. The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he had 30 days after Applicant\u2019s receipt to \nsubmit information. \n3 All background information pertaining to the Applicant, which is limited, was derived from his \nSeptember 2006 e-QIP, unless otherwise stated. \n4 Items 5 \u2013 9. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \nthe foreclosure proceedings, but added that the case against him was resolved.5 These \ndelinquent debts were incurred in the 2004 to 2009 timeframe.  \n \nApplicant offered no documentation that any of his debts with the exception of \nthe foreclosure, discussed supra, have been paid, that he has set up payment plans, \nnor has he submitted any evidence that he contacted any creditors or sought credit \ncounseling or that his debts are or will be resolved. In his Response to SOR, he \nindicated that he was coming out of a difficult divorce in which his former wife was \n\u201cactively trying to ruin\u201d his life. He added that he was trying to resolve his debts, but has \n\u201cnot been able to collect the money necessary\u201d to complete this process.6 \n \nIn his September 2006 e-QIP, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to Sections 28(a) and \n28(b) (asking whether in the last seven years he had been 180 days delinquent on any \ndebts, and whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts, \nrespectively.) Although he admitted falsifying his e-QIP, he did not provide any \nexplanation for doing so nor did he offer any mitigating evidence. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n5 Item 4. \n \n6 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),9 the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n7 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n8 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.j.). As \nnoted supra, he indicated in his Response to SOR that the 2006 foreclosure \nproceedings initiated against him had been resolved. His admissions and evidence \nsubmitted by the Government substantiate the allegations under this concern. In the \nabsence of credible evidence, I am unable to glean any further information, favorable or \nunfavorable, with regard to identified financial concerns. \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of living, \nincrease in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be explained by \nsubject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets or \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \nreturning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling \nlosses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family \nconflict or other problems caused by gambling. \n \nOf the Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions listed supra, two are \napplicable: \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and 19(c): \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d These debts became delinquent in the 2004-2009 \ntimeframe. Furthermore, Applicant did not submit a payment plan, a budget, nor did he \nshow that he has the ability to begin making payments on any of these debts. \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nGuideline \u00b6 20(a) does not provide a temporal or specific definition of what constitutes \n\u201crecent\u201d conduct. In the absence of any evidence, Applicant has nine delinquent debts, \nwhich remain unpaid and not in a payment plan. Moreover, he has not shown sufficient \neffort and/or unusual circumstances to establish his financial problems are \u201cunlikely to \nrecur.\u201d His overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as \na whole,10 I conclude Guideline \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n10See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at \n4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis all debts are considered as a whole.   \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \nThe record disclosed sufficient information to support partial application of \nGuideline \u00b6 20(b). Applicant did go through a contentious divorce in 2006, but offered \nlittle evidence as to how his divorce caused his debts or precluded him from resolving \nhis debts. The record did not disclose any information indicating his actions were in bad \nfaith. However, Applicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of Guideline \u00b6 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebts or if he did so, failed to submit evidence documenting that he did.11  \n \nApplicant does not receive credit under Guideline \u00b6 20(c) because he did not \nreceive financial or credit counseling, and he has no payment plans with his creditors. \nThere is no record evidence of \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control.\u201d  \n \nGuideline \u00b6 20(d) does not fully apply because there is insufficient information to \nestablish that Applicant showed good faith in the resolution of his debts.12 However, he \nis able to receive partial credit for resolving the foreclosure proceedings against him \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. Guideline \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. He did not provide \n\u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue\u201d with respect to any debts, except the foreclosure. In sum, \nhe has not demonstrated sufficient effort to resolve financial concerns to merit full \napplication of any mitigating conditions under the adjudicative guidelines. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,13 I conclude none of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are fully applicable. Based on \n \n11\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n12The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \nthe available evidence, his financial problems are likely to be a concern in the future. \nMoreover, his financial problems are recent, not isolated, and ongoing. \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Guideline E (Personal Conduct),14 the government\u2019s concern is as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAs noted, Applicant provided no explanation for failing to disclose truthful responses to \nquestions 28(a), and 28(b). Considering the record as a whole, I am convinced \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose the information. Numerous factors weighed in \nmy analysis to reach that conclusion, including: Applicant=s age, his level of education, \nhis employment history, the number and value of the debts, his long term disregard of \nthe debts, and his admission. He knew the importance of accurate completion of his-\nQIP, and nevertheless failed to provide information that was material to making an \ninformed security decision.  \n \n\u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; \n \n \n14 Guideline 18. \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or other government protected information; \n \n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the workplace;  \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time \nor resources; \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group; \n \n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to \nthe employer as a condition of employment; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \nOf the Personal Conduct Disqualification Conditions listed supra, two are \napplicable \u00b6 16(a) \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire . . .\u201d, and \u00b6 16(e): \u201cpersonal conduct or \nconcealment of information about one=s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, or duress . . . .\u201d \n \n\u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n                                                          \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline E Mitigating Conditions and conclude that \nnone apply. Applicant=s falsification is recent, and his favorable information is not \nsufficient to apply any of the MCs.  \n \nFor the reasons outlined under the discussions of Guidelines F and E, I conclude \nApplicant=s \nbehavior \nshows \nquestionable \njudgment, \nlack \nof \nreliability, \nand \nuntrustworthiness.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented little or no evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. Applicant \ndid not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nIn reaching this conclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and \nthat analysis does not support a favorable decision. \n \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

Applicant answered the SOR 16 April 2009, and requested a decision without\n1\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 8 October 2009. The record in this case closed\n19 September 2009, the day Applicant\u2019s response to the government\u2019s File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) was due. Applicant provided no additional information for evaluation.\nDecember 31, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR financial allegations. He is a 43-year-old facilities\nrepresentative employed by a U.S. defense contractor since January 2003. He appears\nto have previously held a clearance in 1996, but does not appear to hold one currently.  \n \nThe SOR alleges, government exhibits substantiate, and Applicant admits 27\ndelinquent debts totaling nearly $9,000, falling delinquent since his Chapter 7\nbankruptcy discharge in May 2000. Applicant also admits being $5,800 past due on a\n$39,000 mortgage. Although not alleged in the SOR (and thus not part of my analysis\non the merits of this case), he appears to be nearly $12,000 past due on a nearly\n$155,000 mortgage.\nApplicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of over $26,000 in May\n2000. Since that new start, Applicant has acquired delinquent debt as noted above. He\nhas attempted to resolve these delinquent debts through Chapter 13 wage earner plans\nfiled in May 2002, January 2003, and February 2006. Each of these plans has\neventually been dismissed because of Applicant\u2019s failure to maintain required payments,\nalthough the plan dismissed in May 2008 appears to have disbursed some funds to\nApplicant\u2019s creditors. Applicant intends to satisfy his debts, and provided a personal\nfinancial statement in February 2009 that shows $265 monthly positive cash flow.\nHowever, Applicant is not currently making payments on any of his delinquent accounts.\nApplicant claims, without corroboration, that some of the alleged debts were\nincluded in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing and that other debts are duplicates. He\nattributes his financial problems to his wife\u2019s job loss in 2002 and medical expenses for\nhis son\u2019s surgery in 2007. However, he acknowledges that he and his wife have been\nunable to live within their means for several years.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n\u00b619 (a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;\n3\n3\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns. Applicant has an extensive history of\nfinancial difficulties, which are ongoing.  The record contains little evidence in\n3\nextenuation, mitigation, or rehabilitation. Consequently, none of the mitigating factors for\nfinancial considerations fully apply. Applicant has been unable to live within his means\nsince before 1999.  His wife\u2019s unemployment and his son\u2019s surgery may have\ncontributed to the pre-existing problems, but they cannot fully mitigate them. Further,\nthere is no evidence of a plan for repayment or the possibility of a plan for repayment.\nThe record also lacks any information upon which to base a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. I\nconclude Guideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 43-year-old man who has been married to his current wife since 2005. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 2002 (Item 5 at 13). Applicant has one child, age 17, from his prior marriage. Since 2007, Applicant has worked for a defense contractor as a material handler (Item 5 at 2). There is no record evidence of what his job duties entail. Applicant has spent the majority of his career working as a self-employed roofer (Item 5 at 3-4). In 1995, he decided to pursue a career as a minister, and he enrolled in Bible college. From 1995 to 2000, he attended school part-time.

Stevens, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nAlthough there is some evidence demonstrating that Applicant is in the process\nof rehabilitating his finances, significant questions remain, rendering the issuance of a\nsecurity clearance premature at this time. Clearance is denied.\nOn March 25, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline\nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 17, 2009, admitting all of the allegations,\nand requesting an administrative determination. On July 30, 2009, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). That day, DOHA mailed a copy of the\nSeptember 30, 2009\n\n2\nFORM to Applicant, and he received it on August 11, 2009, along with instructions to file\nany objections or supplementary information within 30 days. Applicant filed a written\nresponse on September 2, 2009, Department Counsel did not object, and the case was\nassigned to me on September 16, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old man who has been married to his current wife since\n2005. A previous marriage ended in divorce in 2002 (Item 5 at 13). Applicant has one\nchild, age 17, from his prior marriage. Since 2007, Applicant has worked for a defense\ncontractor as a material handler (Item 5 at 2). There is no record evidence of what his\njob duties entail.\nApplicant has spent the majority of his career working as a self-employed roofer\n(Item 5 at 3-4). In 1995, he decided to pursue a career as a minister, and he enrolled in\nBible college. From 1995 to 2000, he attended school part-time. By approximately 2000,\nApplicant had earned a minister\u2019s license (Item 4 at 3). Unbeknownst to Applicant, his\nwife did not support his planned career change (Item 7 at 3). In approximately 2001, she\nleft their state of residence with their child, ostensibly to vacation, and never returned\n(Id.). \nThe subsequent divorce proceedings left Applicant saddled with debt related to\nthe divorce, and debt that he and his wife had accrued jointly during their marriage.\nShortly after administrators at the Bible college learned of Applicant\u2019s divorce, they\nrevoked his minister\u2019s license (Item 4 at 3). He was then unable to earn part-time\nincome as a minister.\nBy 2003, Applicant had accrued approximately $86,000 of debt (Item 8 at 15).\nNearly 75% of the debt constituted student loans, a federal tax lien, delinquent child\nsupport, and an insurance claim from a 1999 car accident (see generally, Item 8 at 21,\n25, 46). On May 16, 2003, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection (Item 8 at\n40). The bankruptcy court discharged approximately $40,000 of debt (Item 9). This\nincluded all of the debts listed in the bankruptcy petition except the child support\ndelinquency and the delinquent student loan payments (Id.). \nAfter the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant began paying his child support and\nstudent loan payments steadily (Item 4 at 3). In 2005, Applicant remarried (Id.).\nApproximately a year later, Applicant\u2019s adult stepson, who was living in another state,\ndied. Applicant then had to pay for the transport of the stepson\u2019s remains from the state\nwhere he had been living at the time of death, to the state where he was going to be\nburied (Id.). Applicant\u2019s student loan and child support payments again lapsed (Id.).\nBy June 2008, Applicant\u2019s child support delinquency was $8,269. Since July\n2008, he has been paying approximately $300 monthly, through a wage garnishment,\ntoward its satisfaction (Item 7 at 8-12; 14-16). \n\n3\nAs of June 2008, Applicant\u2019s student loan delinquency totalled $27,821 (Item 4 at\n1). Between July and December of 2008, he made $50 monthly payments (Item 7 at 6-\n7). Applicant contends that he has continued to make monthly $50 payments, but\nprovided no supporting documentation.\nIn March 2008, Applicant opened a cell phone account (Item 10 at 5). Within the\nnext three months, the account became delinquent (Item 11 at 2). It remains\noutstanding.\nApplicant maintains a budget (Item 7 at 4). He has approximately $294 of\nmonthly, after-expense income. He has not sought the assistance of a financial\ncounselor (Item 6 at 3).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\n\n4\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a),\n\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems coincided with the separation and subsequent\ndivorce from his first wife. In 2003, he began addressing his financial delinquencies,\nobtaining a discharge of approximately $40,000 of delinquent debt through the Chapter\n7 bankruptcy process. By 2005, Applicant had remarried, and had begun stabilizing his\nfinances when his stepson died, triggering unexpected burial expenses, and causing\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems to recur. Since July 2008, Applicant has been making\nmonthly payments toward the satisfaction of the child support delinquency. I conclude\nhe has resolved the security concern relating to his outstanding child support balance.\nAlthough Applicant failed to provide comprehensive documentary evidence supporting\nhis contention that he has been making consistent student loan payments, from\nDecember 2008 to the present, he did provide receipts demonstrating six months of\nstudent loan payments between July and November of 2008. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nApplicant has never enrolled in financial counseling. Also, he has accrued an\nadditional delinquency, a cell phone bill, within the last two years. Although he deserves\ncredit for mitigating the security concern related to his outstanding child support, its\nprobative value is somewhat limited because the payments occurred through a wage\ngarnishment. Moreover, it remains unclear whether Applicant is currently making\npayments toward the satisfaction of his debt owed to the student loan creditor. AG \u00b6\n20(c), \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem, and/or there\nare clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d is\ninapplicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\n\n5\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were not caused by reckless spending. Instead,\nthey were caused by his separation and subsequent divorce from his first wife. Later,\nhis ability to make steady payments toward the satisfaction of the debts that were not\ndischarged through his 2003 bankruptcy was disrupted by the death of his stepson and\nthe attendant burial expenses. The circumstances surrounding the accrual of\nApplicant\u2019s debt weigh in his favor.\nI am not persuaded, however, that the circumstances surrounding the accrual of\nApplicant\u2019s debt outweigh the remaining concerns regarding whether Applicant has\nrehabilitated his finances. Nothing in the FORM suggests that Applicant is not credible.\nHowever, given the amount of the remaining student loan delinquency, his unsupported\ncontention that he is currently making payments is insufficient to establish financial\nrehabilitation. Further, Applicant has accrued an additional delinquency within the past\ntwo years that he has yet to satisfy. Upon considering this case in the context of the\nwhole person concept, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the financial\nconsiderations security concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Glendon, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines H (Drug \nInvolvement) and J (Criminal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on April 29, 2008. On April \n28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application, \nciting security concerns under Guidelines H and J. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \nDecember 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 5, 2009; answered it on May 27, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nJune 1, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on August 3, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on August 31, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on \nSeptember 2, 2009, scheduling the hearing for September 23, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection, and Applicant testified. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October \n1, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d \nand 2.a-2.d. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since November 2007. He has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant has a high school education. He was raised by his mother, a single \nparent, and grew up in an economically disadvantaged environment (Tr. 38-39). He is \nunmarried, but he has a 12-year-old son for whom he pays child support (Tr. 34). He \nspends considerable time with his son. In addition to having his son on weekends, he \nhelps him with homework, calls him every night, visits his school, and talks to his \nteachers (Tr. 70-71). \n \n \nIn April 1991, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine \nwith intent to distribute, a felony. He was a senior in high school at the time, and he was \nselling drugs to make money (Tr. 37). He pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years in \njail (suspended), and was placed on probation for one year. The charges were \ndismissed after he completed his probation (Tr. 39; GX 2 at 6; GX 4 at 1; GX 5 at 3). \n \n \nIn November 1996, Applicant was arrested for a hit and run in which injuries were \ninflicted, a felony. He was 24 years old at the time and did not have a driver\u2019s license. \nHe was found guilty of reckless driving, a misdemeanor, and he was fined (Tr. 40-42; \nGX 1 at 34). \n \n \nIn August 1997, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault, after he punched \nthe mother of his son in the eye during an argument (GX 5 at 3; Tr. 66). He pleaded \nguilty (Tr. 43-44). The sentence is not reflected in the record.  \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana about three times a week between January and August \n1999. In August 1999, he was charged with possession of cocaine and marijuana (GX 5 \nat 3). He was placed on probation for five years and ordered to complete a \u201cdrug court\u201d \nprogram (GX 2 at 5). He described the program as a very intense and effective drug \ntreatment program. He was required to attend frequent support group meetings, get a \njob, pay his court costs, and demonstrate personal responsibility (Tr. 47-48). He testified \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhe \u201chad a problem with marijuana\u201d but has never used cocaine (Tr. 46). He completed \nthe drug treatment program and was on probation until October 13, 2006 (GX 4 at 3-5; \nTr. 52-53). \n \n \nIn June 2001, Applicant was stopped for a traffic offense. He did not have a \ndriver\u2019s license at the time, and he was delinquent on his child support payments. He \nspent four months in a detention center and four months on a work-release program at \na diversion center (Tr. 48-50).  \n \n \nIn November 2001, Applicant was charged with being a habitual offender as a \nresult of the June 2001 traffic offenses (Tr. 50-51). He was sent to a detention center for \n90 days, of which 60 days were suspended (GX 4 at 8). \n \n \nIn June 2007, Applicant side-swiped another vehicle while merging onto a \nhighway, but he did not stop. His driver\u2019s license was suspended at the time (Tr. 56). He \nwas charged with reckless driving resulting in an accident, leaving the scene of an \naccident, and operating an uninsured vehicle (GX 2 at 4; GX 4 at 11-13). He was \nconvicted and sentenced to 30 days in jail (suspended). \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana eight to ten times between December 2006 and \nFebruary 2007 (GX 1 at 35). During this time, he was unemployed and living with his \nmother. He testified he used the marijuana to relax (Tr. 61). \n \nApplicant was interviewed by a security investigator in June 2008. The written \nsummary of his interview indicates that he purchased and smoked a marijuana cigarette \nin December 2007, and that he told the investigator that he stopped using marijuana \nafter that date (GX 2 at 5). At the hearing, he testified that he last used marijuana in \nMarch 2007, before he began his current employment. He testified that the date of his \nlast use of marijuana was incorrectly reflected in the written summary of his interview \n(Tr. 64). He no longer associates with persons involved with drugs (Tr. 70). He was \nrequired to undergo a urinalysis before he began his current job, and it was negative \n(Tr. 63).  \n \n \nAbout a week before the hearing, Applicant was involved in another car accident. \nHe rear-ended another vehicle, resulting in substantial damage to his car but none to \nthe car he hit. When this accident occurred, he had insurance and a valid driver\u2019s \nlicense (Tr. 57-59). Unlike his previous car accidents, he stopped and identified himself. \nHe testified that he acted responsibly after this accident because he had decided to \nchange his lifestyle. He denied that his responsible behavior was motivated by his \npending hearing (Tr. 68).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n\n \n4 \n \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from \nDecember 1999 to March 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); he completed a court-ordered drug \nprogram in October 2006 and used marijuana after completing this program (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b); he was arrested, charged, and convicted of possession of cocaine and marijuana \nin August 1999 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and he was arrested and charged with possession of \ncocaine with intent to distribute in April 1991 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  \n \nThe concern under this guideline is as follows: AUse of an illegal drug or misuse \nof a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it raises questions \nabout a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.@ AG \u00b6 \n24. This guideline encompasses Adrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds \nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens).\u201d AG \u00b6 \n24(a)(1).  \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: AG \u00b6 25(a) (Aany \ndrug abuse,@ defined in AG \u00b6 24(b) as \u201cthe illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in \na manner that deviates from approved medical direction\u201d); and AG \u00b6 25(c) (\u201cillegal drug \npossession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or \ndistribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia@). The evidence in this case \nestablishes these two disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated if \u201cthe behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(a). The first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. There \nare no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence \nshows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct,@ \nthen an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates \nAchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or \nrehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing, his last use of marijuana or \nany other illegal drug was in March 2007. On its face, the time period between March \n2007 and the hearing was a \u201csubstantial period of time.\u201d His last misconduct before the \nhearing was the hit-and-run incident in June 2007. On the other hand, he used \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmarijuana, sometimes frequently, from December 1999 to at least March 2007. His drug \nabuse was not the result of circumstances that make it unlikely to recur. Between April \n1991 and June 2007, he was convicted of two drug-related offenses, involved in two hit-\nand-run driving incidents, and convicted of domestic assault. He started his new job in \nNovember 2007 and applied for a clearance in April 2008, about a year after his last \nmarijuana use and ten months after his last misconduct. Since April 2008, he has lived \nunder the pressure of qualifying for a clearance. Under all these circumstances, I am \nnot satisfied that he has established a track record of drug-free and responsible \nbehavior sufficient to demonstrate reform or rehabilitation. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse \nany drugs in the future, such as: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and \ncontacts; (2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an \nappropriate period of abstinence; and (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation.\u201d AG \u00b6 26(b). The evidence establishes AG \u00b6 \n26(b)(1), but not AG \u00b6 26(b)(2), (3), or (4).  \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated by Asatisfactory completion of a \nprescribed drug treatment program, including but not limited to rehabilitation and \naftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified medical professional.@ AG \u00b6 26(d). Applicant completed an intensive drug \ntreatment program, but he has not met the two remaining prongs of this mitigating \ncondition, because he used marijuana eight to ten times between December 2006 and \nFebruary 2007, and there is no evidence of a favorable prognosis. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that in June 2007, Applicant was charged with and convicted of \nleaving the scene of an accident, reckless driving resulting in an accident, and operating \nan uninsured motor vehicle (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that in November 2001, he was charged with \nand found guilty of being a habitual offender (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that in August 1997, he was \narrested for and convicted of domestic assault (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and that in November 1996, \nhe was arrested for hit-and-run and convicted of reckless driving (SOR \u00b6 2.d). The SOR \nalso cross-alleges the drug-related offenses in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d as criminal \nconduct under this guideline (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n \nThe concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. The \nrelevant disqualifying conditions are AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple \nlesser offenses\u201d) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or \nconvicted\u201d). Applicant\u2019s multiple arrests and convictions raise both of these disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline also may be raised by \u201cviolation of \nparole or probation.\u201d AG \u00b6 31(e). Applicant\u2019s arrest in June 2001 may have been a \nviolation of the probation imposed in 1999, but the record does not reflect the terms of \nprobation, and the evidence regarding the habitual offender charge is scant. \nAccordingly, I am not satisfied that this disqualifying condition is raised by substantial \nevidence. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Security concerns \nalso may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). For the reasons set out above in my discussion of \nGuideline H, I conclude these two mitigating conditions are not established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H and J in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult. He presented himself as sincere and candid at the \nhearing. I am satisfied that he wants to put his old lifestyle behind him, but I am not \nsatisfied that he will not fall back into old behavior when he is no longer under the \npressure of qualifying for a clearance. His irresponsible behavior and drug abuse \nextended beyond his youth and into his mid-thirties. He was thirty-five years old when \nthe last hit-and-run accident occurred. He successfully completed a drug treatment \n\n \n8 \n \n \nprogram, but there is no evidence of a favorable prognosis. He behaved responsibly \nwhen he had another accident about a week before the hearing, but this situation \ndiffered from the earlier hit-and-run cases, where he fled because he did not have a \nvalid driver\u2019s license. When he had his latest accident, he had a valid driver\u2019s license \nand insurance, and he knew his hearing was imminent. He has not yet established a \ntrack record of drug-free and responsible behavior. See Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.37 through \nE3.1.41 (reconsideration authorized after one year). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nJ, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns based on drug involvement and \ncriminal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 17, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire for Sensitive Positions version of a Security Clearance Application (SF \n86).1 On February 4, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nher a set of interrogatories pertaining to her finances. She responded to the \ninterrogatories on March 23, 2009.2 On March 2, 2010, DOHA issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n \n1 Item 4 (SF 86), dated April 17, 2008. \n \n2 Item 7 (Applicant\u2019s Answers to Interrogatories, dated March 23, 2009). \nMarch 18, 2011\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive);  and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified Information (December \n29, 2005) (AG) applicable to all adjudications and other determinations made under the \nDirective, effective September 1, 2006. The SOR alleged security concerns under \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations), and detailed reasons why DOHA could not \nmake a preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 12, 2010. In a sworn \nstatement, dated April 6, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected \nto have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A complete copy of \nthe Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant on \nNovember 4, 2010, and she was afforded an opportunity, within a period of 30 days \nafter receipt of the FORM, to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant received the FORM on September 22, 2010, and \nelected not to make any additional submissions. The case was assigned to me on \nJanuary 14, 2011. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted nearly all of the factual allegations \npertaining to financial considerations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h., 1.l., and 1.n. through 1.t.) of \nthe SOR. Those admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. She denied the \nremaining allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.i. through 1.k., and 1.m.) of the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor, currently serving as \na \u201csupervisor\u201d with a nationwide communications company, and she is seeking to obtain \na security clearance.3 She has never had a security clearance.4 She has not served in \nthe U.S. military.5 Although Applicant considered herself unemployed from August 1990 \nuntil December 1999,6 in reality, she was a stay-at-home mom.7 During a portion of that \nperiod (from July 1998 until February 1999) she was employed as program aide for a \ncompany, and (from February 1999 to December 1999) she was an assistant manager \nfor the same company.8 From December 1999 until May 2001, Applicant was employed \nas a manager by another company.9 She was unemployed from May 2001 until July \n \n3 Item 7, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n4 Item 4, supra note 1, at 11. \n \n5 Id. at 9. \n \n6 Id. at 5. \n \n7 Item 6 (Personal Subject Interview, dated May 6, 2008), at 1. \n \n8 Item 4, supra note 1, at 5. \n \n9 Id. at 5. \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n2001.10 From July 2001 until September 2001 she was a nurse assistant,11 and was \nself-employed as a shop owner from September 2001 until June 2004.12 She was also \na factory worker from June 2002 until October 2002.13 Applicant was a part time \nconsultant from June 2004 until December 2005,14 and from December 2005 until \nJanuary 2007, she was a credit collections specialist.15 In January 2007 she joined \nanother company as a supervisor, and remained there until March 2008.16 It is unclear \nwhen Applicant joined her current employer as a supervisor.17  \n \nDuring the period August 2006 until at least May 2008, Applicant was enrolled in \nan online distance learning program at a technical university where she earned two \ncertificates of achievement.18 Her estimated graduation date was February 2009,19 but \nthere is no evidence that the graduation took place. \n \nApplicant has been in several marital or spouse-like relationships. She was \nmarried in April 1990 and had two sons, born in 1990 and 1994, respectively.20 She and \nher husband were divorced in September 1998.21 She maintained a spouse-like \nrelationship from May 2001 until July 2001, and again from an unspecified point in 2005 \nuntil at least April 2008, during which time she was supported by her friend and by child \nsupport from her ex-husband.22 She and her friend have one child together.23 She was \nalso in a spouse-like relationship with another friend from June 2005 to October 2005, \nduring which time her boyfriend paid the rent.24 \n \n \n \n10 Id. at 4. \n \n11 Id. \n \n12 Id. at 3. \n \n13 Id. at 4. \n \n14 Id. at 3. \n \n15 Id. \n \n16 Id. \n \n17 Item 7, supra note 2, at 1. \n \n18 Item, 4, supra note 1, at 2-3. \n \n19 Id. \n \n20 Id. at 6, 8. \n \n21 Id. at 6. \n \n22 Item 6, supra note 7, at 1. \n \n23 Item 4, supra note 1, at 8-9. \n \n24 Item 6, supra note 7, at 1. \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nFinancial Considerations \n \nIt is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial difficulties. In \nMarch 1998, she filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under the provisions of \nChapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.25 On July 7, 1998, an unspecified number of \ndebts, with unspecified balances, were discharged.26 The identity of the creditors has \nnot been revealed. Applicant contends the debts were those of her husband before their \nmarriage as well as marital debts.27 At some unspecified point after 1998, accounts \nstarted to again become delinquent, and some of the accounts were placed for \ncollection with a variety of collection agents, and some of the accounts were charged \noff. One delinquent account went to judgment. In June 2003, she filed a voluntary \npetition for bankruptcy under the provisions of Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy \nCode.28 That bankruptcy was dismissed in December 2003.29 It is unclear if Applicant \nmade any payments under the bankruptcy, and the reasons for the dismissal were not \nspecified, although Applicant believes it was because of her 1998 bankruptcy which was \nonly five years earlier.30 \n \nOn several occasions between 2001 and 2003, Applicant wrote non-sufficient \nfund (NSF) checks on a joint checking account which she maintained with her friend.31 \nShe subsequently was cited, pled guilty, and was fined for each of the NSF offenses.32 \nApplicant attributed her actions to her friend\u2019s failure to update the account records to \nreflect his automated teller machine (ATM) withdrawals, and her lack of awareness that \nshe was issuing bad checks.33 \n \nIn May 2008, while being interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM), Applicant acknowledged a number of delinquent \naccounts for medical bills which arose between 2001 and 2004, during a period when \nher business was not successful and she had no healthcare insurance.34 She also had \na long-standing delinquent utility bill which she claimed to be disputing.35 There was \n \n25 Item 9 (Internet Download \u2013 Bankruptcy Filings, dated February 22, 2010), at 1. \n \n26 Id. \n \n27 Item 6, supra note 7, at 2. \n \n28 Item 10 (Internet Download \u2013 Bankruptcy Filings, dated February 22, 2010), at 1. \n \n29 Id. \n \n30 Item 6, supra note 7, at 2. \n \n31 Id. \n \n32 Id. \n \n33 Id. \n \n34 Id. \n \n35 Id. at 2-3. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nalso a long-standing judgment since 2003.36 Applicant professed an intention to contact \nthe creditors of her delinquent medical accounts and the judgment in order to start \nmaking payments.37  \n \nOn several occasions in mid-2008, Applicant wrote credit reporting agencies and \ncollection agencies in efforts to dispute multiple reporting of the same legitimate \naccounts and seeking validation and verification of various charges.38 As a result, some \naccounts were removed from Experian and TransUnion credit reports, but they \nremained on Equifax credit reports. Applicant disputed one account (SOR \u00b6 1.a.), with \nan identified account number, because the SOR alleged the unpaid balance was $127, \nwhile one credit report indicated the balance was $120 and a credit report from the \nfollowing year said it was $127. The basis for her dispute was that she had dental \ninsurance that should have covered the charges and the dollar amount was slightly \ndifferent.39 She disputed another dental account (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) in the amount of $1,705, \nclaiming \u201cmultiple inaccuracies,\u201d but did not specify what those inaccuracies were.40 \nShe tried to settle that account but the collection agency did not reply to her dispute.41 \nApplicant also disputed a 2003 judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.l.) in the amount of $5,560, claiming \nshe should not have been liable for charges related to the early termination of a lease \nfor her business, and then added a comment that the judgment no longer appears on \none credit report.42 Applicant disputed one account (SOR \u00b6 1.n.) pertaining to a \nrepossessed automobile in the amount of $34,029, claiming the debt was too old and it \nwas not legitimate.43 She contended there was unethical conduct by the automobile \ndealer and stated that her disputes in 2008 resulted in the removal of the adverse listing \nfrom TransUnion and Experian credit reports.44 She disputed the account with Equifax \nin February 2009, and as of December 2009, the adverse entry is no longer listed by \nEquifax.45 As to the other delinquent accounts that were charged off or which were \nremoved from her credit reports because they were more than seven years old, she has \nno intention of pursuing those creditors to resolve the delinquent accounts.46 \n \n \n36 Id. at 3; Item 5 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, Equifax Credit Report, dated April 17, 2008) at 5. \n \n37 Item 6, at 3. \n \n38 Letters to credit reporting agencies and various collection agencies, various dates, attached to Item 7, \nsupra note 2. \n \n39 Dispute Download, undated, attached to Item 7. \n \n40 Dispute Download, dated March 22, 2009, attached to Item 7. \n \n41 Id. \n \n42 Dispute Download, undated, attached to Item 7. \n \n43 Dispute Download, dated February 11, 2009, attached to Item 7. \n \n44 Id. \n \n45 Item 8 (Equifax Credit Report, dated December 15, 2009).  \n  \n46 Id. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s sons attend a cost-free, private, coeducational home and \nschool for children from families of low income, limited resources, and social need.47 In \nMay 2004, she took a one-week overseas vacation to a Caribbean island which she \npaid for herself.48 \n \nThe SOR identified 18 continuing delinquencies as reflected by credit reports \nfrom 200849 and 2009,50 totaling approximately $44,710. Among the delinquencies are \naccounts pertaining to medical providers, a repossessed automobile (with a delinquent \nbalance of $34,029), utility service, and credit cards. Some accounts have been \ntransferred, reassigned, or sold to other creditors or collection agents. Other accounts \nare referenced repeatedly in the different credit reports, in many instances duplicating \nother accounts listed, either under the same creditor name or under a different creditor \nname. Some accounts are identified by complete account numbers, while others are \nidentified by partial account numbers, in some instances eliminating the last four digits, \nand in others eliminating other digits.  \n \nApplicant contends she has paid three of the accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i., 1.j., and \n1.m.) and claims \u201cthere are duplicates\u201d for the collection agency regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nHowever, she has failed to provide documentation to support her contentions or explain \nwhich of the other accounts with the one particular collection agency are duplicates. The \n2008 combined credit report clearly lists the same accounts separately by credit \nreporting agency, but Applicant has offered no evidence to support her contention that \naccounts are listed repeatedly in the SOR. To date, Applicant has produced no \nevidence to indicate that she has contacted her remaining creditors, established \nrepayment plans, or commenced making any payments. \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant ever received financial counseling covering \nsuch topics as debt consolidation, money management, repayment plans, or budgeting, \nand it is unclear if she ever received any such counseling in conjunction with her 1998 \nor 2003 bankruptcy filings.  \n \n \nOn March 17, 2009, Applicant prepared a personal financial statement,51 \nindicating a monthly net income, including child support, of $4,550.10;52 $2,545.90 in \nmonthly living expenses;53 and debt payments of $750.01;54 with a monthly net \n \n47 Id. at 1. \n \n48 Id. \n \n49 Item 5, supra note 36. \n \n50 Item 8, supra note 45.  \n \n51 Personal Financial Statement, dated March 17, 2009, attached to Item 7. \n \n52 Id.

The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his \ndesignee to grant an applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a \nfinding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d58   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view tshe guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d59 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \n \n \n55 Id. \n \n56 Id. \n \n57 Department of the Navy v.

Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro.

The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.60  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d61 \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d62 Thus, nothing \nin this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole \nor in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, \nor patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are \nreasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \n \n60 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG \u00b6 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nAs noted above, it is unclear when Applicant first started to experience financial \ndifficulties. At some unspecified point, she failed to keep up with her monthly payments, \nand accounts started to become delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection \nand some accounts were charged off. In July 1998, her debts were discharged under \nChapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Five years later, financial problems again \narose, when she failed to keep up with her monthly payments, and accounts started to \nbecome delinquent. Some accounts were placed for collection and some accounts were \ncharged off. One went to judgment. In June 2003, Applicant filed for bankruptcy under \nChapter 13, of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but that petition was dismissed in December \n2003. As to some of her delinquent accounts, especially those that were charged off or \nwhich were removed from her credit reports because they were more than seven years \nold, Applicant indicated that she has no intention of pursuing those creditors to resolve \nthe delinquent accounts. The record is silent as to why Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent \naccounts remained largely unaddressed by her after she secured gainful employment in \n2001, and she did not start paying off her delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Also, under AG \n\u00b6 20(b), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe conditions that resulted \nin the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Evidence \nthat Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are \nclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is potentially \nmitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@63 Also, AG \u00b6 20(e) may apply where \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \n \n63 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that she or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems commenced some time before 1998, and although \nresolved by a discharge of her debts under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in \nJuly 1998, they reappeared some time before 2003, and still have not been resolved. \nWhile she attributed some of her continuing financial difficulties initially to her ex-\nhusband\u2019s premarital debts as well as their marital debts, an unsuccessful business \nventure, and periods of unemployment, she never explained why she failed to resolve or \neven address nearly all of her delinquent accounts for long periods of time, especially \nafter she became gainfully employed in 2001. Considering her ability to spend money \non a Caribbean vacation in 2004, as well as her ownership of a timeshare, it appears \nthat she is unconcerned that her delinquent accounts are still unresolved. Because the \nfinancial situation is frequent and continuing in nature, and the continuing causation is \nnot adequately described, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s handling of her \nfinances, \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances, \ncasts \ndoubt \non \nher \ncurrent \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) only partially applies because of Applicant\u2019s occasional periods of \nunemployment, her divorce, and her failed business venture.  Applicant had no debts \nfollowing her 1998 bankruptcy, yet she incurred additional debt which eventually \nbecame delinquent. While she claims one lengthy period of unemployment, she was \nactually a stay-at-home mother. During other periods, she cohabited with her friends \nand they supported her. Moreover, sufficient time has passed since she generated her \nbills and obtained employment, and she still has not addressed most of her delinquent \naccounts, preferring to dispute them or simply wait for them to drop off her credit \nreports. The reasons stated do not establish she acted \u201cresponsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d  \n \nAG & 20(c) does not apply because there is no clear evidence establishing that \nApplicant actually received financial counseling.  \n \nApplicant receives very limited application of AG \u00b6 20(d) because, with few \nexceptions, she failed to address her delinquent accounts except by disputing them. \nWith a monthly net remainder of $1,254.19 available for discretionary spending, it was \npossible that Applicant could have commenced the payment of some delinquent \naccounts. Nevertheless, the vast majority of them remain unpaid or unresolved. She is, \ninstead, waiting for her debts to be removed from her credit reports as they become \nolder than seven years, and she has no intention of pursuing those creditors to resolve \nthe delinquent accounts.64 While there were some indications that she intended to \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd.

In the absence of such documentation, most of the \nevidence consists of promises to pay or unsupported contentions that some creditors \nmay have been paid. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply because while Applicant has furnished documented \nproof of her disputed accounts, the basis of her disputes (the credit reports list the same \naccounts multiple times, or she had health insurance, or she should not be responsible \nfor a broken lease, even though the matter went to judgment) do not address the \ngravamen of the disputes, to wit, the accounts were not Applicant\u2019s or she has a legal \nbasis not to pay certain accounts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Some of her \npre-1998 delinquent accounts were attributed to her ex-husband; she had an \nunsuccessful business; and she went through periods of unemployment. She also \nsuccessfully disputed some of her delinquent accounts, causing them to be removed \nfrom her credit reports.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is substantial. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies. She failed to address her current \nfinancial responsibilities, and simply emphasized her difficult marriage, unsuccessful \n \n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and \nattempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts current. \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nbusiness, and unemployment to explain her financial difficulties. As noted above, \nApplicant\u2019s stated intention was to dispute some delinquent accounts because they \nwere listed multiple times in various credit reports, and wait until other delinquent \naccounts reached the seven-year point and would automatically be removed from her \ncredit reports. Even though she has sufficient funds each month to make substantial \npayments in an effort to resolve her accounts and the judgment, she has chosen not to \ndo so. A Caribbean vacation and a timeshare are more important. Applicant\u2019s actions \nreflect traits which raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.65 Her limited good-faith efforts \nare insufficient to mitigate continuing security concerns.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn January 29, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of Applicant eligibility for a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded (undated) to the SOR, and elected to have his case decided\non the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant Material\n(FORM) on April 6, 2009, and did not supplement the record. The case was assigned to\nme on June 18, 2009.   Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings and exhibits,\neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJuly 24, 2009\n\n2\nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 13,\nbankruptcy in June 2003, which was dismissed in October 2005 and (b) accumulated 19\ndelinquent debts exceeding $24,000.00. \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nadded no explanations. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 48-year-old technical support specialist for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by\nApplicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant married in November 1984 (see item 4).  He has three children  from\nthis marriage, ages 13, 18 and 21 (item 4).  \nApplicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy relief in June 2003.  Credit reports\nreveal that his Chapter 13 petition was dismissed in October 2005.  Reasons for the\ndismissal are not reported.  \nBetween 2000 and 2008, Applicant accumulated a number of debts that are\nreported to be delinquent in his December 2008 and December 2007 credit reports (see\nitems 6 and 7).  His consumer debts exceed $24,000.00 in amount. Applicant advised in\nhis October 2008 answers to the Government\u2019s interrogatories that he is considering\npetitioning for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (see item 5). \nApplicant does not provide any documented explanations of his debt\naccumulations or why he has not pursued financial counseling and debt consolidation\nbefore considering Chapter 7 bankruptcy relief.  He does not indicate whether he has\nreceived financial counseling or considered debt consolidation.  Nor does he provide\nany explanations or evidence of corrective steps he has taken to resolve his outstanding\ndebts.  \nApplicant did not include any endorsements or performance evaluations. Both\nmight have been helpful in evaluating his overall contributions and trustworthiness.   \n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines\nrequire the judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating\n\n3\nConditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be\ngranted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these\nfactors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative\nGuidelines, judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing\nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2\nof the Directive, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommon sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the  judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\n\n4\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.  Because E.O. 10865 requires that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, \u201csecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a technical support specialist for a defense contractor who\npetitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy (dismissed) and accumulated a number of\ndelinquent debts.  These delinquent debts were accumulated between 2001 and 2008\nand have not been addressed according to Applicant\u2019s credit reports.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to address\nthese debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and DC \u00b619(c) \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nLittle is known of the circumstances that contributed to Applicant\u2019s debt\ndelinquencies and his failed Chapter 13 petition.  Without more information about the\ncircumstances surrounding his debts, his filing for Chapter 13 relief, and his past\nefforts (if any) in repaying or otherwise resolving his delinquent debts, Applicant\ncannot be credited with any notable progress to date in regaining control of his\nfinances.  Further, he provides no hard assurances of any commitment to resolve his\ndebts in the foreseeable future.  Applicant\u2019s finances still require a good deal of effort\non his part to fully stabilize them. \nConsidering his failure to furnished documented explanations of his debts, his\ndismissed  Chapter 13 petition, and his failure to provide evidence of responsive\nsteps he initiated to address his debts, Applicant may not take advantage of MC \u00b6\n20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibility.\u201d  Application of MC \u00b6 20(b) is two-\npronged in its requirements.  First, an applicant must make a documented showing\nof extenuating circumstances associated with his accumulations of delinquent debts.\nSecond, he must display responsible efforts in addressing his debts, both during and\n\n5\nafter the precipitating events have subsided.  Here, Applicant has provided no\nqualifying documentation of either MC \u00b6 20(b) requirement to warrant application of\nthis mitigating condition.  Application of any part of MC \u00b6 20(b) is unjustified.\nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant either under any of the other\nmitigating conditions based on the lack of any probative evidence of restorative steps\ntaken by him to date. Afforded an opportunity to supplement the record with\ndocumented contacts and work-out arrangements with some or all of his listed\ncreditors, Applicant declined to do so.\n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the\njudgment questions raised by his failed Chapter 13 petition and his ensuing\naccumulation of still unresolved delinquent debts.  To date, Applicant has not shown\nany tangible efforts to resolve his outstanding debts to overcome security concerns\nabout the state of his finances. \nConsidering the record as a whole, it is still too soon to make safe predictive\njudgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to resolve his old consumer debts, and restore\nhis finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security clearance.\nUnfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.t. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E 2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in\nthe context of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed\nabove, I make the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):  AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.t:\n                Against Applicant\n\n6\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance\nfor Applicant.  Clearance is denied. \n                                          \nRoger C. Wesley\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Accordingly, her request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on October 25, 2007. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nAugust 12, 2009\n\n \n \n2\n                                                \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn February 3, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG).2  In her signed and notarized Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted to all the \nallegations except those at \u00b6\u00b61.a., 1.c., 1.l. \u2013 1.n., and 1.p. She also requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 23, 2009, and the case \nwas assigned to me on March 25, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on April 2, \n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 28, 2009. During the hearing, \nthe government offered seven exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through \n7, which were admitted without objection.3 Applicant testified, and offered nine exhibits. \nApplicant did not present witnesses. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) were marked as A through \nI, and admitted without objection. I held the record open to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional documentation. Department Counsel forwarded, without objection, Applicant\u2019s \ntimely submission of six additional documents, admitted as AE J through O. DOHA \nreceived the transcript on May 7, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in her response to the SOR are admitted herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, Applicant\u2019s response to the \nSOR, and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant, 29 years old, attended university from 1998 to 2005. She completed the \nrequirements for a bachelor\u2019s degree in social science.4 She intends to pursue a \ngraduate degree, which will be funded by her employer. She is single and does not have \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as \namended. \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006. The Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supersede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the \nDirective, and they apply to all adjudications or trustworthiness determinations in which an SOR was \nissued on or after September 1, 2006. \n \n3 The Contents section of the transcript mistakenly identifies Government Exhibits 4 through 7. The \ncorrect identification can be found at Tr. 15-19.  \n \n4 Applicant's degree will be awarded officially when she pays approximately $1,000 she owes to the \nuniversity. This is a separate debt not alleged in the SOR (Tr. 30, 69-71). \n\n \n \n3\n                                                \nchildren. She has worked as an administrative assistant for a defense contractor for \napproximately one year. This is the first time she has applied for a security clearance \n(GE 1, 2; AE J; Tr. 6-7, 30-31). \n \nApplicant held primarily clerical and sales positions between 2000 and 2003. Most \nof her delinquencies started accruing in 2003. She worked during her breaks while \nattending college, and also served as a tutor with Americorps for six months in 2001. \nShe was unemployed five months in 2003 and six months in 2004. She held a position in \nthe office automation department of a defense department agency from 2004 to 2006. \nWhen she worked for temporary agencies in 2006 and 2007, one agency sometimes \nfailed to pay the employees, and sometimes wrote paychecks with insufficient funds. \nFollowing unemployment from September 2007 to March 2008, she attained her current \nposition.  \n \nApplicant's Social Security earnings statement of October 2008 shows that most \nof the years between 2000 and 2007, her annual income varied from $3,800 to $7,467. \nHer highest earning years were 2004 ($15,000); 2005 ($39,000), and 2006 ($29,900). \nHer income in 2007 declined to $3,380. Applicant occasionally provides financial \nassistance of $200 to $300 to her parents (GE 1; AE I; Tr. 33, 47, 65). \n \n \nApplicant's current annual income is $52,000. When she completed DOHA \ninterrogatories in November 2008, Applicant earned a net monthly income of $3,200.5 \nAfter expenses of $2,590 per month, and debt payments of $1,100 per month, Applicant \nhad a negative monthly remainder of $480. She testified that, as of the hearing date, her \nnet monthly remainder has increased to approximately $100. The positive remainder \nresulted from the fact that she is no longer paying the monthly amount on the debt \nalleged in 1.a., until the company provides her with the correct current balance, as she \nrequested. In addition, Applicant's parents provided her with a car, which has no \noutstanding balance. Her current car expense is now $175, rather than the $490 \nexpense listed in the personal financial statement. Applicant has $220 in her bank \naccounts. She has not participated in financial counseling. She has not opened new \ncredit card accounts in the past eight years (GE 3; AE J; Tr. 35-37, 49-52, 62-65). \n \nThe Statement of Reasons alleges 15 debts. Applicant\u2019s exhibits show the current \nstatus of the alleged debts as follows: \n \n$ \nBank credit card/judgment (allegation 1.a.): Payment Plan. Applicant \ncontends that this is a duplicate of the debt cited at 1.o. The debt is \nbeing collected through a law firm. Applicant contacted the firm in \nNovember 2008 and set up a payment plan of $200 per month. She \nprovided evidence that she paid a total of $750 in November and \n \n5 As of January 2009, she no longer has the additional $200 per month from a part-time job, which \nreduces her net monthly income to approximately $3,000. \n\n \n \n4\nDecember. Applicant testified that she paid additional amounts on this \ndebt through garnishment of approximately $1,600 to $1,700, but the \ncreditor has been unable to provide records related to the total she has \npaid through garnishment. She intends to pay the debt in full (GE 2, 5, \n7; AE G; Tr. 33-37, 39).  \n \n$ \nHospital debt (allegation 1.b.): Payment Plan. Applicant was involved \nin a car accident and was admitted to the hospital. The accident \noccurred when she was employed but did not have health insurance. \nApplicant set up a payment plan in late 2008, and pays $200 per \nmonth by automatic withdrawal from her bank account. She expects \nthe debt to be satisfied in 2010 (GE 2; AE A; Tr. 37-39).  \n \n$ \nCable company debt (allegation 1.c.): Paid. Applicant contacted the \ncable company and confirmed that she had a zero balance for her \n2007 account in another state. She obtained a printout showing her bill \nfor that residence was $368.47 and that she paid account in full by \nNovember 2007. She has an account now with the same company and \nit is current (GE 1, 2, 4; AE B; Tr. 39). \n \n$ \nStudent loans debt to federal government (allegations 1.d \u2013 1.j.): \nPayment Plan. Applicant fell behind in her student loan payments \nwhen she was unemployed and/or underemployed. In October 2008, \nshe established a payment plan of $400 per month. The balance in \nApril 2009 was $38,187, which she had reduced from the $39,914 \nowed in October 2008. AE L shows Applicant's payments, starting in \nOctober 2008, which are automatically deducted from her checking \naccount (Answer; GE 2, 4; AE C, J, L; Tr. 39-41). \n \n$ \nStudent loan owed to bank (allegation 1.k.): Payment Plan. Applicant \naccepts this debt as her own, and agrees with the balance alleged. \nShe contacted the creditor in regard to this student loan and set up a \npayment plan of $100 per month, which was verified by a coworker \nwho witnessed the arrangements (GE 2, 4; AE J, K; Tr. 41- 43, 55-56). \n \n$ \nCredit card debt (allegation 1.l.): Paid. Applicant, believing the \n$12,500 balance listed in her credit bureau report was incorrect, \nrepeatedly contacted the creditor. Ultimately, the company confirmed \nthat the correct balance was approximately $1,900. Applicant then \nobtained a settlement in the amount of $385, which she paid in May \n2009 (GE 2; AE D, J, N; Tr. 43-45). \n \n$ \nStore credit card (allegation 1.m.): Paid. On November 17, 2008, \nApplicant obtained a settlement offer for $1,137.02 on an original \n\n \n \n5\n                                                \nbalance of $2,279. She paid the debt on November 20, 2008, and \nprovided supporting documentation (GE 2, 4; AE E; Tr. 45). \n \n$ \nJewelry store debt (allegation 1.n.): Paid. Applicant paid the balance \non this debt in November 2008 and provided supporting documentation \n(GE 2; AE F, J, M; Tr. 45-46). \n \n\u2022 \nBank credit card \u2013 (allegation 1.o.) \u2013 Payment plan. See allegation 1.a, above. \n \nApplicant's college friend, who later became her co-worker, submitted a \ncharacter reference letter attesting to Applicant's academic abilities, dedication to \nperformance on her job within a federal agency, and her volunteer work with military \nmembers. Another co-worker, who is currently a research fellow and formerly an Air \nForce member of 30 years, discussed the trustworthiness Applicant displayed when \nworking with private employee information, and the integrity and honesty she \ndemonstrated when supporting defense projects (AE H). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).6 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline F (financial considerations).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of whether \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest7 for an Applicant to either receive or \ncontinue to have access to classified information. The government bears the initial \nburden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision \nto deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government \nmust be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets \nits burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s \ncase. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy \n \n6 Directive. 6.3. \n7 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n\n \n \n6\n                                                \nburden of persuasion.8 A person who has access to classified information enters into a \nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the \ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the \nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national \ninterests as her or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard \ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in \nfavor of the government.9 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes \nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known \nsources of income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds \nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. \n \nApplicant accumulated numerous debts, including one judgment and many that \nwere referred for collection, and was unable to pay them for a number of years. \nApplicant's credit bureau reports, her response to interrogatories, and her hearing \ntestimony establish that AG \u00b619a (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b619c (a history of not meeting financial obligations) apply. There is no evidence that \nher debts resulted from frivolous spending, alcoholism, gambling or deceptive \npractices.  \n \n \nThe Financial Considerations guideline also contains factors that can mitigate \nsecurity concerns. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20b, AG \u00b6 20d and \u00b6 AG 20e are \nrelevant to the facts of this case.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20b (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual \n \n8 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n9 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies. Applicant\u2019s income fluctuated \nsignificantly over the past several years. She was unemployed for several periods \nbetween 2003 and 2008. For the years 2000 to 2003, she was underemployed, earning \nbetween $2,975 and $7,500, and in 2007, her annual income was $3,380. During the \npast year, she earned a substantially larger annual income, which allowed her to \novercome the financial constraints of previous years. She acted responsibly by taking \nsteps to resolve her debts once her salary increased. Applicant paid the balances \nowed on the cable company, jewelry store, and department store accounts. She \nestablished payment plans for her bank credit card, hospital bill, and federal and \nprivate student loans. Based on these actions, I find AG \u00b6 20d (the individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 20e (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) also applies. Applicant disputed the $12,500 credit card debt alleged at \nallegation 1.l. Through her persistent efforts and contacts with the company involved, \nApplicant demonstrated that, in fact, she owed only $1,900, a small fraction of the \namount listed in her credit bureau report. Applicant provided evidence of this reduced \nbalance, which she intends to pay. Applicant also disputed the total amount she owes \non the debt alleged in allegation 1.a. She made several payments on her plan while \nawaiting validation of the current amount owed. I find for Applicant on Guideline F, \nFinancial Considerations. \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.  \n\n \n \n8\n \n \nApplicant accrued significant debt over the past six years, especially for a young \nperson. The largest single debt resulted from her efforts to complete her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, a laudable goal that she did attain. Her financial problems stemmed primarily \nfrom college expenses, combined with unemployment and underemployment. Now that \nshe has attained a steady job, at a substantially higher salary, she has taken steps to \nresolve her delinquencies: she paid several debts, and set up payment plans for the \nlarger debts. She also demonstrated persistence in working with another creditor on a \ndebt she disputed, and eliminated a $10,000 error in the balance. She eliminated a \nsignificant negative monthly remainder, and now shows a small positive cash flow at \nthe end of the month. Applicant\u2019s conduct demonstrates maturity, and her documented \nefforts show a sincere intent to meet her financial obligations. A fair and commonsense \nassessment of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance shows she has satisfied the doubts about her ability or willingness to protect \nthe government\u2019s interests. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence satisfies the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guideline. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.p.  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nRITA C. O\u2019BRIEN \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on February 17, 2009; answered it on February 23, \n2009; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the \nMay 20, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nrequest on February 24, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on March 3, \n2009, and the case was assigned to me on March 9, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on March 11, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 1, 2009. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified but presented no documents. I held the record \nopen until April 15, 2009, to enable Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He \ntimely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s email transmitting his evidence and Department Counsel\u2019s \ncomments regarding AX A through D are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 9, 2009.The record closed on April 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \nand 1.d through 1.i. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old program manager for a federal contractor. He served \non active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1982 to January 2003, retiring as a \nsergeant first class (E-7). He retired with a fifty percent service-connected disability (GX \n3 at 1). He worked for a private company from February to November 2003, and for a \nfederal contractor from November 2003 until May 2008, when he began working for his \ncurrent employer. While working full-time, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nmanagement and human resources in May 2005 and a master\u2019s degree in human \nresource development in August 2006. He received a security clearance in April 1986 \nwhile in the Army, but it was administratively terminated when he was assigned to \nrecruiting duty, which did not require a clearance. He does not currently hold a \nclearance (Tr. 11). \n \nApplicant was married in May 1981 and divorced in June 1991. He remarried in \nJanuary 1995. He has four children, ages 26, 22, 15, and 12, and a stepdaughter, age \n17. The two oldest children are attending college, and he provides financial assistance \nto one of them (Tr. 26). \n \nApplicant testified that he retired from the Army ill-prepared for the financial \ndemands of the civilian world. He found himself unable to sustain himself and his family \nin their previous lifestyle.  He began falling behind on his bills, because his income was \ninsufficient to cover his monthly expenses, which included medical expenses for \ntreatment of fused vertebrae in his neck. Although he was entitled to medical care \ncoverage, he did not realize the financial consequences of using out-of-network \nproviders. He decided to take care of essential living expenses but to let revolving credit \nfall behind. He considered but rejected the possibility of filing a bankruptcy petition. He \nkept current with creditors who were willing to negotiate, but he stopped payments to \nthose who would not negotiate (Tr. 28-29; GX 3 at 1).  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant currently lives geographically separated from his family because he \nhas children in high school, and he is incurring the additional expense of maintaining a \nsecond household (Tr. 29, 58). He lives in a one-bedroom apartment and uses public \ntransportation whenever possible to save money (Tr. 52). \n \nApplicant consulted with a debt counselor and decided he could make more \nprogress by handling his delinquent debts himself. He testified he has adopted the \n\u201cDave Ramsey\u201d method of debt resolution, under which he pays more than the \nminimum on smaller debts, pays the minimum on larger debts, and progresses to \npaying more on the larger debts as the smaller debts are paid off (Tr. 31, 41, 64). He \nconcentrates on paying off current debt before addressing delinquent debt. He uses a \nspiral notebook to track his progress (AX A; Tr. 59). \n \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant submitted a personal financial \nstatement (PFS) dated November 3, 2008. It reflected net monthly income of $8,319, \nexpenses of $5,857, debt payments of $1,489 (not including any debts alleged in the \nSOR), and a net monthly remainder of $973. He has no money in savings, about $360 \nin investments, and no emergency funds (GX 4 at 7; Tr. 63).  \n \nSince responding to DOHA interrogatories in November 2008, Applicant has paid \noff two charge accounts listed on his PFS but not alleged in the SOR (Tr. 51). The total \namount owed on these two accounts was about $984.  \n \nApplicant is currently making payments on a late-model truck for which he owes \nabout $27,816, and in which he has negative equity. His plan is to pay down the \nbalance on the truck sufficiently so that he can trade it for another vehicle with a lower \ninterest rate and lower monthly payments. He hopes to be able to trade in his truck by \nthe summer of 2010. He plans to use funds generated by lower monthly payments on \nhis truck to pay off his second vehicle, currently used by his family, on which he owes \nabout $14,367. After his truck and car payments are resolved, he intends to start paying \noff his remaining debts, including the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR (Tr. 61-63). \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nMedical \n$128 \nUnpaid \nGX 2; Tr. 35 \n1.b \nMedical \n$30 \nUnpaid \nGX 2; Tr. 36 \n1.c \nApartment damage \n$102 \nDisputed  \nAX A; AX D; Tr. 36 \n1.d \nCharge account \n$3,174 \nUnpaid \nGX 2; Tr. 39-40 \n1.e \nCredit card \n$17,640 \nUnpaid \nGX 2; Tr. 45 \n1.f \nCredit card \n$4,889 \nUnpaid \nGX 2; Tr. 45 \n1.g \nCredit card \n$11,885 \nSame as 1.e \nTr. 17; GX 2 at 3, 12 \n1.h \nCredit card \n$3, 443 \nSame as 1.f \nTr. 17; GX 2 at 4, 13 \n1.i \nMedical \n$387 \nUnpaid \nGX 2; Tr. 49-50 \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant disputed the debt for damage to an apartment, denying that he caused \nthe damage. He testified he believed the disputed debt was resolved favorably by \ntelephone in 2004 (Tr. 68-69). When he realized it was on his current credit report (AX \nB), he filed a dispute with the credit reporting agency (AX D).  \n \n \nApplicant believes the delinquent medical bills are either co-payments or items \nfor which insurance coverage was denied. He has not disputed any of these debts (Tr. \n65). Even though the amounts are relatively small, he has not paid them because it \nwould require him to deviate from the \u201cDave Ramsey\u201d method (Tr. 65-66).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s plan for resolving his debts assumes he will continue in his current \njob. If his application for a clearance is denied, his pay would be substantially reduced; \nand he probably would return to the location where his family now lives and seek new \nemployment (Tr. 66-67). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \n\n \n5 \n \n \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $41,678. Two of the debts \nappear to be duplicates, leaving seven remaining delinquent debts totaling about \n$26,350. The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history \nof not meeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent \nspending beyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, \nsignificant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e), shifting the burden to him to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nThe evidence indicates that the credit card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h \nduplicate the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. When the same conduct is alleged \ntwice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be \nresolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at \n3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This mitigating \ncondition is not established, because Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved, \nare numerous, are not the product of unusual circumstances, and cast doubt on his \ngood judgment. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. The first prong of this mitigating \ncondition is not established because Applicant\u2019s debts were normal living expenses. \nEven his medical problem was not \u201cunexpected,\u201d because it was diagnosed while he \nwas still on active duty and his medical expenses after retirement were either \ncopayments or the result of using out-of-network providers.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nreceived counseling but decided he could better handle the situation himself. This \ncondition is not established because his financial problems are not yet under control. \nApplicant has devised a plan to gain control of his finances, but it is long term and \nsubject to many contingencies. He does not expect to accomplish the first step, trading \nhis truck for another vehicle at a lower interest rate and lower monthly payments, until \nthe summer of 2010. It is contingent on his ability to continue paying down the principle \non the loan, a reliably foreseeable trade-in-value for the truck, his ability to qualify for \nfinancing at a lower rate, and his ability to find a suitable vehicle at a price he can afford. \nHe has no savings and no emergency funds to cover unexpected expenses. His plan \nassumes he will continue working at his current pay level, which he cannot do without a \nclearance.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). Evidence of past irresponsibility is not \nmitigated by payment of debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance.  \n \nThe evidence is sparse regarding the time frame in which Applicant began \nnegotiating with creditors, but it appears that his initial efforts predated his current job \nand security clearance application. I am satisfied his efforts to resolve his debts have \nbeen motivated by a sense of obligation and not the pressure of qualifying for a security \nclearance. \n \n \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of each \nand every debt alleged in the SOR. See ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, \n2008). An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. \nMay 21, 2008). There also is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. Id. \n \nApplicant has adopted a plan to reduce his indebtedness. His plan, however, will \nnot begin to address the delinquent credit card accounts and medical bills alleged in the \nSOR until some time after the summer of 2010, and it is subject to numerous \nuncertainties and contingencies. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. \n \nFinally, security concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \nAthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt \nwhich is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). \nApplicant denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He attempted to resolve it by telephone, \nand he thought it was resolved until he saw it on his credit report. He has filed a formal \ndispute and requested the debt be deleted from his credit file. I conclude this mitigating \ncondition is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, articulate, well-educated adult. His loyalty and dedication \nare not in question. He was candid and sincere at the hearing. He exercised bad \nfinancial judgment and fell into financial distress shortly after retiring from the Army. In \nsome respects, he has learned from his mistakes, but he is far away from his goal of \nfinancial stability. He is confident of his ability to gain control of his finances, but his \nconfidence rests in part on very optimistic assumptions. He remains vulnerable to \npressure or coercion. He has not fully dispelled the concerns about his good judgment. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required \nby Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 47-year-old senior quality assurance engineer of a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Applicant\u2019s background Applicant was born and raised in the PRC to parents of Chinese descent (see ex. 1). She earned a bachelors degree from a PRC university in 1983 (R.T., at 51). She immigrated to Hong Kong with her father in 1985 (R.T., at 52-53). Applicant immigrated to the U.S. on a student\u2019s visa in 1988 at the age of 27 to apply her engineering training and advance her education (R.T., at 44-46). Once in the U.S. she enrolled in a recognized U.S. university and was awarded a master of science degree in chemical engineering in 1992, and a second masters degree in statistics in July 2004 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 47-51). Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2001 (ex. 1). Upon becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant surrendered her Chinese passport and renounced her Chinese citizenship (see ex. 2). In October 1985, Applicant married H in the PRC (R.T., at 79). H was born in the PRC and immigrated to Hong Kong in 1985, where he met Applicant. He accompanied her on a spouse visa to the U.S. in 1988 (R.T., at 79-80). Applicant has no children from her marriage. H abandoned Applicant around 1994, and left with virtually all of the debts to administer (R.T., at 80-81). She filed for divorce against H in 19",

Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, \nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \nBesides its five exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of eight \ndocuments:  Background Note: China, U.S. Department of State (January 2009); \nCountry Specific Information: China, U.S. Department of State (March 2009); Country \nReports on Human Rights Practices - 2008, China, U.S. Department of State  (February \n2009); Annual Report to Congress from the National Counterintelligence Executive on \nEconomic Collection, 2005-2006 (August 2006); Intelligence Threat Handbook \n[Unclassified/For Official Use Only), Interagency OPSEC Support Staff (IOSS) (June \n2004); 2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission (November 2007); Background Note: Hong Kong, U.S. Department of State \n(February 2008); Country Specific Information: Hong Kong SAR, U.S. Department of \nState (February 2009). \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292, at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. April 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875, at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006).  Administrative notice is \nappropriate for noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, \nAdministrative Law, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown, \nadministrative notice was granted with respect to the above-named background reports \naddressing the geopolitical situation in Hong Kong. Administrative notice was extended \nto the documents themselves, consistent with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid.  \nThis notice did not foreclose Applicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the \ninformation contained in the reports addressing Hong Kong\u2019s current state.   \n \nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues \n \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested leave to supplement the \nrecord to provide a copy of an ISCR decision pertinent to Applicant\u2019s statute of limitation \nclaims.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the \nrecord. The Government was afforded three days to respond.  Within the time permitted, \nApplicant provided a copy of another judge\u2019s decision (ISCR Case No. 08-01122, Oct. \n21, 2008).  Department Counsel, in turn, provided a copy of an Appeal Board decision \nthat reversed the trial judge\u2019s decision relative to the applicant\u2019s statute of limitations \narguments.  Applicant\u2019s post-hearing decision and Department Counsel\u2019s Appeal Board \nreversal are received for guidance purposes.  \n \nSummary of Pleadings \n \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have (a) parents who are citizens and \nresidents of Hong Kong, (b) a brother who is a citizen and resident of Hong Kong, and \n(c) a sister who is a citizen of Hong Kong and resides in the U.S.     \n \n\n \n3\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have three debts totaling more than \n$50,000.00.   Allegedly, Applicant has not paid any of these debts. \n \n For her answer, Applicant admitted each of the allegations in the SOR.  She \nclaimed that she has casual and infrequent contact with her parents.  She claimed that \nshe and her brother have become strangers for the past 15 years.  She explained that her \nsister immigrated to the U.S when she was 20 years of age to pursue her education.  She \nclaimed her sister is a permanent U.S. resident who has applied for U.S. citizenship.  With \nrespect to her admitted debts, she claimed she accumulated them during her marriage \nand assumed responsibility for them as a part of her divorce settlement.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old senior quality assurance engineer of a defense \ncontractor who seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and \nadmitted by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings \nfollow. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s background \n \nApplicant was born and raised in the PRC to parents of Chinese descent (see ex. \n1).  She earned a bachelors degree from a PRC university in 1983 (R.T., at 51).  She \nimmigrated to Hong Kong with her father in 1985 (R.T., at 52-53).  \n \n \nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. on a student\u2019s visa in 1988 at the age of 27 to \napply her engineering training and advance her education (R.T., at 44-46).  Once in the \nU.S. she enrolled in a recognized U.S. university and was awarded a master of science \ndegree in chemical engineering in 1992, and a second masters degree in statistics in July \n2004 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 47-51).  Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June \n2001 (ex. 1).  Upon becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant surrendered her Chinese passport \nand renounced her Chinese citizenship (see ex. 2). \n \nIn October 1985, Applicant married H in the PRC (R.T., at 79).  H was born in the \nPRC and immigrated to Hong Kong in 1985, where he met Applicant. He accompanied \nher on a spouse visa to the U.S. in 1988 (R.T., at 79-80).  Applicant has no children from \nher marriage.  H abandoned Applicant around 1994, and left with virtually all of the debts \nto administer (R.T., at 80-81).  She filed for divorce against H in 1997 and received her \nfinal divorce decree in 1998 (R.T., at 80).  She divorced H in July 1998 and maintains no \ncontact with him (see ex. 1; R.T., at 62).  She does not know whether or not H ever \nbecame a naturalized U.S. citizen (R.T., at 82).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother was born in the PRC to parents of Chinese descent, and \nremains a citizen of the PRC and a resident of Hong Kong (ex. 1).  She and Applicant\u2019s \nsister left the PRC for Hong Kong in 1989.  Her mother earned a living as a school \n\n \n4\nteacher, while living in the PRC (R.T., at 55).  She continued her teaching career after \nshe returned to Hong Kong for a number of years, before her retirement in 1997 (R.T., at \n54, 77-78).  Upon arriving in Hong Kong, she never applied for Hong Kong citizenship. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Hong Kong to parents of Chinese descent and \nbecame a citizen of Taiwan by birth.  He returned to Hong Kong in 1985 (R.T., at 54), \nand was followed by her brother in 1987 (R.T., at 54).  Applicant\u2019s father was an \nadministrator when residing in the PRC.  Upon returning to Hong Kong, he became a \ndoor man, and was later promoted to a manager (R.T., at 56-57).  He never applied for \nChinese citizenship.  He is over 80 years of age \n \nTogether, Applicant\u2019s parents have a small but comfortable retirement income and \nenjoy a quiet and frugal life together in a small village located in Hong Kong.  They own \ntheir own apartment and do not require or receive any financial assistance from \nApplicant (R.T., at 66-67). \n \n \nBesides her parents, Applicant has a brother who was born in the PRC, but \napplied for and became a citizen of Hong Kong following his arrival in 1987.  Her brother \nresides in Hong Kong, is unmarried, and is currently underemployed (R.T., at 57-59).  \nEven though he still lives with her parents, she has had no contact with her brother for \nover 15 years (R.T., at 58). \n \nApplicant\u2019s only sister was born in the PRC and applied for and became a citizen \nof Hong Kong following her arrival in 1989 (see ex. 2).  Her sister immigrated to the U.S. \nin 1991 on a student\u2019s visa (at the age of 20) to pursue her studies (R.T., at 68-69, 76).  \nShe applied for U.S. citizenship and is a permanent resident of the U.S. (see ex. 1).  Her \nsister is unmarried and has a son under 18 years of age (R.T., at 62).  She eaned \nseveral graduates degrees in the U.S. and currently teaches at an American university \n(R.T., at 61, 76-77).  Applicant last spoke to her sister in January 2009 and does not \nknow if or when her sister obtained her U.S. citizenship, or whether she has since \nrenounced her Hong Kong/PRC citizenship (R.T., at 61-62, 75).  \n \nApplicant has maintains some telephone contact with her parents (R.T., at 59).  \nShe last spoke to her mother in February 2009 (R.T., at 59), but maintains no e-mail or \nletter contact with either of her parents (R.T., at 60-61).  She visited her parents in Hong \nKong in 1995, and again in 2002, but not subsequently (R.T., at   ).  Her mother last \nvisited Applicant in the U.S. in 2003 (R.T., at 68).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandparents passed way.  Before her grandfather\u2019s death in 1997, he \nwas a prisoner of war in the PRC (ex. 2; R.T., at 65). Applicant does not know anything \nabout her grandfather or other grandparents, to include her extended family members.   \n \nIn addition to her sister, Applicant has several cousins who reside in the U.S. \n(R.T., at 74-75).  She has little contact with any of them.  \n \n\n \n5\nApplicant has not been involved in any embarrassing or compromising incidents \noverseas, and has not engaged in any illegal activities (see exs. 1 and 2).  She provides \nno financial assistance to any of her family members (who are self-sufficient), or to \nanyone or any entity outside the U.S.  She has never served in a foreign military; nor is \nshe willing to do so (exs. 1 and 2).  She has had no contact with any foreign government \nrepresentatives or organizations since residing in the U.S.  She has no financial interests \nor obligations in Hong Kong. \n \nApplicant has no property ownership, no foreign bank accounts, no retirement, \nmedical, or education benefits in Hong Kong, and no social security or any other \nreceived government benefit from Hong Kong or any other foreign country (see exs. 1 \nand 2).  She has never had any foreign property confiscated, and s he has never \nsponsored any foreign nationals to the U.S. (see ex. 4).  \n \nApplicant has never voted or sought political office in Hong Kong or any foreign \ncountry, and has not performed or attempted to perform duties that could serve the \ninterests of Hong Kong or any foreign government. To the best of her knowledge, her \nfamily members residing in Hong Kong are free to travel outside of the country and are at \nno risk of coercion, compromise, or pressure by any members of the Hong Kong or PRC \ngoverning bodies (see ex. 2; R.T., at 83-84).   \n \nBy contrast, Applicant has held jobs in the U.S. and maintains brokerage accounts \nwith U.S. banks.  She owns the home she resides in. She considers herself a fully \nassimilated U.S. citizen (see ex. 4; R.T., at 26), and professes no allegiance, preference, \nsympathies or alliances with any person or entity or government in the PRC, or \nanywhere else (see ex. 4).  She fully understands the importance of reporting any all \nforeign travel to his employer\u2019s security officials. \n \nHong Kong\u2019s historical background \n \n \nHong Kong\u2019s history dates back over five millennia.  It developed strong trading \nrelationships with Britain in 1842 (following the First Opium War) under the Treaty of \nNanking (see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 2).  Britain was granted a \nperpetual lease on the Kowloon Peninsula under the 1860 Convention of Beijing, and \nexpanded its control over the surrounding area under a 99-year lease of the New \nTerritories in 1898 (id.). \n \n \n \nIn the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Hong Kong developed as a warehousing \nand distribution center for British trade with southern China (see Background Note: Hong \nKong, supra).  Heavy migration to Hong Kong occurred after the Communist takeover of \nmainland China in 1949.  Hong Kong achieved considerable economic success as a \nBritish colony in the post-1949 period as a manufacturing, commercial, finance, and \ntourism center.  High life expectancies, literacy, per capita income, and a confluence of \n\n \n6\nother socioeconomic indicators serve to illustrate Hong Kong\u2019s measurable \nsocioeconomic achievements. \n \n \nHong Kong\u2019s reversion \n \n \nSince July 1, 1997, Hong Kong has been a Special Administrative Region (SAR) \nof the PRC.  This is important to note because of the generally recognized heightened \nrisks that are associated with the PRC, and the unilaterally imposed citizenship and \nresidency status on Applicant and her family members who are birth residents and \ncitizens of Hong Kong before the reversion (see Country Specific Information: Hong \nKong SAR, supra, at 5).  \n \n \nHong Kong today has a population of 7.00 million (95 per cent of which are \nChinese), and is one of the most densely populated regions of the world (see \nBackground Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 1-2).  China has given Hong Kong considerable \nautonomy over its domestic affairs. The PRC has retained responsibility and control over \nforeign and defense affairs.  State Department records confirm that the PRC has taken \nan increasingly active oversight role over Hong Kong=s political developments. \n \n \nStill, both the Sino-British joint declaration (1984) and the basic Law provide \npolitical safeguards to ensure that Hong Kong retains its own political, economic, and \njudicial systems and unique status for at least 50 years after reversion and continue to \nparticipate in international conventions and organizations under the name of Hong Kong, \nChina (see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 2-3). Hong Kong, with its quasi- \nautonomy, remains a free and open society where human rights are respected, courts \nare independent, and there are established traditions of respect for the rule of law (see \nid., at 3-5).   \n \n \nCitizens of Hong Kong are limited, however, in their ability to change their \ngovernment, and the legislature is limited in its power to change government policies \n(see Background Note: Hong Kong, supra, at 3). And the PRC still retains oversight and \nultimate veto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and political decision making.  \nAny changes in Hong Kong\u2019s Basic Law (such as to achieve full universal suffrage) will \nrequire approval by Hong Kong=s chief executive (currently Donald Tsang), at least a \ntwo thirds approval by the Legislative Counsel (Legco), and then the PRC\u2019s National \nPeople\u2019s Congress\u2019 Standing Committee (NPCSC), which is by no means assured (see \nid, at 3). \n \n \nBecause Applicant\u2019s parents and brother are still citizens and residents of Hong \nKong with unilaterally imposed Chinese citizenship by the PRC\u2019s immigration law, the \nPRC\u2019s system, its respect for human rights and the rule of law, and its collection \nactivities that extend throughout its maintained intelligence operations in Hong Kong and \nMacau, become quite relevant to evaluating any potential security risks associated with \nApplicant\u2019s parents and brother, and to some extent her sister who remains a Hong Kong \ncitizen and resident of the U.S.   Despite her more limited contacts with her parents and \n\n \n7\nsiblings in recent years, she still retains her strong affections for her immediate family \nmembers, which is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. \n  \n \nThe PRC\u2019s country status \n \n \nEstablished in 1949, the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) with over 1.3 billion \npeople is the world\u2019s most populous country, as well as one of the world\u2019s fastest \ngrowing economies (see Background Note: China, supra, at 1-2).  Today it continues to \nundergo rapid economic and social change (growing its economy at a rate of about 11.4 \nper cent per year).  Political power, however, remains centralized in the Chinese \nCommunist Party (CCP) with little indication of any change in the foreseeable future.  \nChina\u2019s 70.8 million square mile country is authoritarian in structure and ideology. The \nPRC possesses increasingly sophisticated military forces and continues to modernize \nitself from a land-based military power to a smaller, more mobile, high tech military that \neventually will be more capable of mounting limited operations beyond its coastal waters \n(see id, at 15-17).  \n \n \nWhile not a country acclaimed to be hostile to U.S. persons and interests, the \nPRC maintains a relationship that is more competitive than cooperative.  The PRC \noperates a large and sophisticated intelligence bureau, entitled the Ministry of State \nSecurity (MSS) (see Intelligence Threat Handbook, supra, at 17-22).  These operations \nuse clandestine agents to collect intelligence on Western consortia investing in the PRC \nwho are suspected of involvement in attempts to democratize the PRC, as well as other \npro-democracy groups thought to be engaging in anti-communist activities (see id., at \n71-74). \n \n \nBased on past reports to Congress, the PRC is considered one of the most active \ncollectors of U.S. economic and proprietary information (see Annual Report to Congress \nfrom the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic Collection, 2005-2006, \nsupra).  The PRC is known especially to use its intelligence services to gather \ninformation about the US and to obtain advanced technologies and uses Hong Kong to \nfurther its collection purposes (see Intelligence Threat Handbook, supra, at 24, 27. 71-\n72).  The PRC actively monitors international communications satellites from maintained \nintercept facilities, in addition to collecting information on US military operations and \nexercises.  Examples of PRC economic espionage are cited in the Annual Report to \nCongress from the National Counterintelligence Executive on Economic Collection, \n2005-2006, supra, at 10-12.  Most of the examples of illegally exported technology to the \nPRC involved high tech equipment and devices used in missile and aircraft guidance \nsystems, highly sensitive weapons parts, infrared cameras and missile microchips.  \n \n  \nAs a corollary of its authoritarian roots, the PRC has never been known for a \npositive human rights record among Western nations and international human rights \ngroups.  Part of this can be explained in terms of the PRC\u2019s lack of any cognizable \ntradition for respect for developing democracies and the rule of law. State Department \ncountry reports on the PRC cite the country\u2019s poor human rights record.  Its noted \n\n \n8\nhistorical abuses include the suppression of political dissent, arbitrary arrest and \ndetention, forced confessions, torture, forced relocations, and mistreatment of prisoners \n(see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2008, China, supra, at 2-12). \n  \n \nOf growing concern to U.S. security interests are the State Department=s latest \nreports of increased high profile cases in the PRC involving the monitoring, harassment, \ndetention, arrest, and imprisonment of journalists, writers, activists, and defense lawyers \nseeking to exercise their law-protected rights (see Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices - 2008, China, supra). The State Department cites a comprehensive, credible \naccounting of all those killed, missing, or detained, reported incidents of deaths in \ncustody, disappearance, torture, forced locations, and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading \ntreatment or punishment (see id., at 4-12).  While the PRC officially denies holding any \npolitical prisoners, Western non-government organizations estimate that several hundred \npersons remained in prison in 2006 for the repealed crime of counterrevolution, and \nthousands of others were either serving sentences or were being detained for counter-\nrevolutionary offenses (id., at 9).  \n \n \nIn its November 2007 Report to Congress, the Security Review Commission \ndescribes the PRC as a country intent on acquiring and exploiting the knowledge \ndeveloped by its many collection agents: legally, if possible, and otherwise illegally by \nespionage (see  2007 Report to Congress, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review \nCommission, supra, at 104-06).  The PRC\u2019s concerted efforts to acquire sensitive \ntechnology poses a considerable challenge to U.S. counterintelligence measures.  \nRecent indictments of Chinese citizens for espionage have served to highlight the \nPRC=s spying activities in the U.S. (see id.).  Violating its own 2004 U.S.-China \nagreement, the PRC oft-fails to schedule timely end-use inspection visits of dual-use \nitems licensed for export to the PRC.  Better export controls can be effective only if they \nare multilateral in scope (id.).  Without effective dual use export controls in place, the \nPRC can be expected to acquire dual use technologies with military potential through the \nU.S. and other source countries.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances \n \nApplicant and her ex-husband owned a home in the U.S. during their marriage \nand accumulated considerable credit card debt (R.T., at 37-41).  After their divorce in \n1998, Applicant continued to live in the home, suffered from depression, and struggled to \npay her bills without any financial support from H (see ex. 2; R.T., at 40-41).  \n \n In December 2007, Applicant moved to her current state of residence and put her \nold home up for sale.  Before the house was sold in December 2008, Applicant did not \nhave much left over for paying her bills (R.T., at 70-71).  \n \n Records show that she accumulated three delinquent debts totaling more than \n$50,000 during her marriage., and assumed responsibility for these debts as a part of \nher divorce settlement in 1998 (see exs. 2, 3 and 4).  She explored both bankruptcy and \n\n \n9\ncredit counseling following divorce, but elected not to pursue either option due to \nuncertainties in her employment and concerns about the credit consequences from a \nbankruptcy filing (see ex. 2; R.T., at 38-39, 71-72). \n \nTo date, Applicant has made no payments on the three delinquent debts listed in \nthe SOR.  Records show that her debt to creditor 1.a was closed in 2001 with a \ndelinquent balance of $28,685.00 (see exs. 3 and 4; R.T., at 42).  She has made no \neffort to contact or otherwise address this debt.  In December 2008, she received a \ncancellation of debt notice from creditor 1.a that presumably was filed by the issuing \ncreditor with the IRS.  Whether this debt is treated as income to Applicant by the IRS is \nunclear at this time. \n \nApplicant has a delinquent debt with creditor 1.b in the amount of $10,677.00 (see \nexs. 3 and 4).  Reportedly, this account was opened before 2001, became delinquent in \n2001, and was charged off by the creditor in June 2005 with a delinquent balance of \n$10,677.00 (exs. 3 and 4).  Applicant has made no concerted attempts to pay or \notherwise discharge this account since at least 2001. \n \nApplicant\u2019s third and final listed debt is a delinquent debt owed to creditor 1.c in \nthe reported amount $11,718.00 (see exs. 2, 3 and 4).  This account was placed in \ncollection and charged off in February 2008 with a reported balance of $11,718.00 (see \nexs. 3 and 4).  Applicant failed to make any manifest attempts to resolve this debt since \nat least  2001.  \n \nApplicant considers all of her listed credit card debts to be barred by relevant \nstatutes of limitation and are no longer collectible (R.T., at 43-44, 71-72).   She cites to \nher most recent credit report for proof that she no longer has any negative accounts and \nhas regained financial control of her life (R.T., at 44). \n \nApplicant has a net monthly income of $5,015.00 from her work (see ex. 2).  She \nclaims net monthly expenses of $1,490.00 and a mortgage debt of $1,779.00 a month \n(ex. 2).  Her personal financial statement reflects a net monthly remainder of $1,746.00 \n(ex. 2).  This monthly remainder is a little more than she reported after the sale of her \nhome in 2007, but not by much.  \n \nApplicant provides no evidence of her performance evaluations, endorsement \nfrom her supervisors and colleagues, or contributions to her community.  She provides \nno evidence of assessments from her friends and acquaintances in her community or \ncivic and charitable contributions.   \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by \nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These \n\n \n10\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and \nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the \nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In \naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into \naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \nE2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to \nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision. \n \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy \nfactors are pertinent herein: \n \nForeign Influence \n \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if \nthe individual has divided  loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest.  Adjudication under the this \nGuideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism   See revised Adjudicative Guidelines \n(AG), \u00b6 6. \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n            The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and \nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, \nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Compulsive \ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including \nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income \nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially \nprofitable criminal acts.  Adjudication Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18. \n \n \n \n                  Burden of Proof \n \nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continued   \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \n\n \n \n11 \n                                      \n \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \n \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted facts \nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven have \na material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  \nThe required showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to \naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified \ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must \ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified information. \n \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or \nmitigation of the Government's case. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was born in the PRC to parents of Chinese descent and traces some of \nher British family roots from her father through Hong Kong\u2019s historical colonial links with \nBritain. She immigrated to the U.S. in 1991 for educational reasons.  She completed her \ngraduate curricula in the U.S. and became a U.S. citizen in 2001.  Applicant is an \nexperienced engineer with a U.S. defense contractor.  Security issues of concern to the \nGovernment focus on the citizenship and residence of her parents and brother in Hong \nKong following its reversion to the PRC in 1997, a country known for its poor human \nrights record and its engagement in economic data collection in Hong Kong and the U.S.  \nAdditional security concerns are raised over the Hong Kong citizenship of Applicant\u2019s \nsister, who resides in the U.S.  And security concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s three \ndelinquent debts that have since been written off without any tangible effort expended by \nApplicant in paying or otherwise resolving the debts.   \n \n \nForeign influence concerns \n \nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily members (her parents and brother) who are citizens and residents of Hong Kong \n(which has since reverted to the PRC) might be subject to undue foreign influence by \nPRC authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s possession or control.  \nLesser concerns are also raised over Applicant\u2019s sister who is a citizen of Hong Kong and \na resident of the U.S.  \n \n\n \n \n12 \n                                      \n \n Because Applicant and her immediate family members have PRC citizenship by \nvirtue of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the PRC in 1997, they present potential heightened \nsecurity risks covered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign \nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d of the Adjudication \nGuidelines for foreign influence.  \n \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s family members in what is now the \nPRC poses some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign \ninfluence that could compromise classified information under Applicant's possession \nand/or control.  DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d has possible application due to \nthe  presence of Applicant\u2019s father in the PRC. Although Applicant has not seen her \nmother since 2003; nor has she seen her father since 2007, she talks to her parents on a \nregular basis.  Such contacts could create potential conflicts of interest; even though she \nhas no voting or financial interests in China (inclusive of Hong Kong). \n \nApplicant and her family have roots in Hong Kong (for years a British colony) and \nare steeped in British culture, free markets, democratic government, human rights \nprotections, and respect for the rule of law.  Applicant has no contacts with or interests in \nthe PRC. \n \nFrom what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily residing in Hong Kong have any political affiliations with the Hong Kong or PRC \ngoverning bodies.  Her parents or siblings do not have any history to date of being \nsubjected to any coercion or influence.  Nor do any of her immediate family members \nappear to be vulnerable to the same.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe citizenship status and presence in Hong Kong of Applicant\u2019s father poses \nsome risk because of Hong Kong\u2019s reversion to the PRC\u2019 and the latter\u2019s sovereign \noversight powers over all of Hong Kong\u2019s domestic affairs, and plenary responsibility over \nits external affairs.  The risks are manageable, though, and reconcilable with U.S. \nsecurity interests. Applicant\u2019s contacts with her parents are more than neutralized by the \nformer\u2019s demonstrated strong loyalties to the U.S. and manifest commitments to protect \nthis country\u2019s security interests and resist any family pressures that could weaken her \nfiducial duties to protecting classified information. \n \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se \nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are \ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an acceptable \nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence cases must by \npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for \nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Hong Kong.  To be \n\n \n \n13 \n                                      \n \nsure, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over matters they \nview to be of strategic importance to their own vital interests.  We know that even friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the U.S.  (see ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. \nBd. March 29, 2002). \n \nThe new AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the \nU.S. as an important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with \ncitizenship and residency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical \naims and policies of the particular foreign regime involved do matter.  \n \nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's parents and \nbrother in Hong Kong (a Chinese sector that continues in a semi-autonomous way \ndespite its reversion to the PRC), any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or \nundue foreign influence brought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or \neconomic or proprietary data out of Applicant through her family members residing in \nHong Kong is a manageable one.  None of these family members have any relationships \nor demonstrated connections with any officials or agents of the Hong Kong  and PRC \ngovernments that could create the basis for potential conflicts. \n \n Applicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating condition: \nMC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country \nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the U.S.\u201d  \n \nFor Hong Kong, with its quasi-autonomy, remains a free and open society where \nhuman rights are respected, courts are independent, and there are established traditions \nof respect for the rule of law (see id., at 3).  True, citizens of Hong Kong are limited in \ntheir ability to change their government, and the legislature is limited in its power to \nchange government policies (id.).  Further, the PRC still retains oversight and ultimate \nveto authority over all of Hong Kong\u2019s economic and political decision making. Since \nreversion, though, the PRC has essentially left Hong Kong to manage its own internal \naffairs without any significant interference from PRC authorities.  This deference is not \nexpected to change in the foreseeable future.  \n \nApplicant, accordingly, may take partial advantage of mitigating condition: MC \u00b6 \n8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such \nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between \nthe interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the U.S.\u201d Further, in the hypothetical situation where Applicant\u2019s parents or \nany of her family members residing in Hong Kong or the U.S. were to be pressured, \nApplicant\u2019s strong loyalties and security commitments to the U.S. make it very unlikely \nthat she would permit himself to be pressured into compromising classified information.  \n \n\n \n \n14 \n                                      \n \nOf full benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either \nbecause the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, \npatriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S., are well demonstrated and enough \nunder these circumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in her \nrelationships with her immediate family members. \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to conflict \nof interests with her parents and brother who continue to reside in Hong Kong.  Not only \nhas Applicant become a naturalized U.S. citizen and received her advanced engineering \ndegree in the U.S., but she has made every effort to work, save, and pursue her financial \ninterests exclusively in the U.S.  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being \nbrought to bear on her parents and siblings, or any other family members, would appear \nto be minimal.  By all reasonable accounts of the presented record, Applicant has no \nvisible conflicts of interest with Hong Kong and the PRC or property interests in China \nthat could be at risk to exploitation or compromise by Hong Kong government authorities \nor PRC military or intelligence officials.   \n \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's parents and \nbrother residing in Hong Kong are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive \njudgments about Applicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to \nher familial relationships in Hong Kong (now part of the PRC).  Her demonstrated \nloyalties and commitments to protecting U.S. security interests, make it highly unlikely \nshe would succumb to any foreign influence brought to bear on herself or her parents by \nPRC government or military officials.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the \nallegations covered by Guideline B. \n \n \n \nFinancial issues \n \n         Security concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially \noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide \nby rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the person at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent \ndebts and her past inability to pay these debts warrant the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts, and \u00b619(c)) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to he limited resources following her \ndivorce in 1998 and ensuing extra burdens imposed on her meeting her mortgage and \nother debt responsibilities without assistance from her ex-husband.  Faced with mortgage \n\n \n \n15 \n                                      \n \ndemands, symptoms of depression and limited income, she let some of the old consumer \ndebts she inherited from her marriage become delinquent.  She still has not addressed \nthree major debts and provides no indications of her willingness to do so.  Applicant\u2019s \nprogress to date in regaining control of her finances is insufficient to mitigate security \nconcerns over the state of her financial situation.  \n \n \nTo demonstrate her good-faith intentions in addressing her listed debts, Applicant \nessentially relies on the availability of governing statutes of limitation in her current and \nformer state to render her listed debts non-enforceable.  She cites to a DOHA decision \n(ISCR Case No. 08-01122 (Oct. 21, 2008)) to sustain her claims that statute of limitations \nbars render debts unenforceable and to that extent should mitigate any security concerns \nover outstanding debts.  However, this decision was reversed by the Appeal Board (see \nISCR Case No. 08-1122 (App. Bd. Feb 9, 2009, and for all of the reasons advanced by \nthe Board, Applicant\u2019s reliance on statutes of limitations bars in her current and former \nstates is not sufficient to overcome judgment and trust concerns that relate to her past \nfailures to address her valid debts.   \n \n \n \nBased on her evidentiary showing, Applicant\u2019s proofs are sufficient to establish \nsome extenuating circumstances associated with her debt accumulations.  As a result, \nMC  \u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the \nindividual acted responsibility,\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019 s circumstances.  \n \n         Full mitigation credit is not available to Applicant, however, based on the facts of \nthis case. Neither Applicant\u2019s oral nor written evidence reflect any initiated voluntary \nrepayment efforts on her behalf on her three listed debts.  Her past unwillingness to \naddress these debts with her positive income sources preclude her taking advantage at \nthis time application of any of the mitigating conditions covered in the financial guideline. \n                                             \n    Holding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial responsibilities, \namong which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial stability in a \nperson cleared to access classified information is required precisely to inspire trust and \nconfidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of a clearance \nholder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in financial cases (as here). \n \n         Whole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment \nquestions raised by her accumulation of delinquent debt.  She is not able to demonstrate \nenough tangible effort in addressing her covered debts to mitigate her debt \ndelinquencies, or establish control over her finances.  Without more evidence of her \noverall contributions in her work and community and her progress in stabilizing her \nfinances, it is still too soon to credit her with restoring her finances to levels compatible \nwith minimum levels of judgment and trustworthiness. In balance, whole person \nassessment does not enable Applicant to establish judgment and trust levels sufficient to \n\n \n \n16 \n                                      \n \nenable her to overcome appraised security concerns arising out her accumulation of \ndelinquent debts. \n \n \nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding \nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources she had to address them with \nfollowing her 1998 divorce, and the absence of corrective steps to address her old debts, \nit is still too soon to make safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay her \ndebts and restore her finances to stable levels commensurate with her holding a security \nclearance.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered by \nsubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c.   \n \n        In reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including each \nof the factors and conditions enumerated in AG E2(a) of the Adjudicative Process of \nEnclosure 2 of the Directive. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact, \nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate \nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance. \n \nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n     \n \nSub-paras 1.a through 1.d:  \n                     For Applicant  \n \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDREATIONS):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n           \nSub-paras 2.a through 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n   \nConclusions \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security \nclearance.

On January 22, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\n\n2\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations)\nand Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On July 23, 2009, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Thomas M. Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge failed to consider\nproperly various matters in mitigation under Guideline J; (b) whether the Judge expanded the scope\nof the sole allegation under Guideline J; and (c) whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual findings are\nsupported by substantial record evidence.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision. \n The Judge found that, in 2001, Applicant was indicted, tried, and acquitted for participating\npersonally and substantially as a government employee in a contract in which she had a financial\ninterest (18 U.S.C. 208 (a) and 2).  The Judge made extensive findings regarding the underlying\nconduct in 2000 and 2001 that led the to the charge.   Specifically, he found she violated federal\n\u201cconflict of interest rules\u201d by informing a government contractor that, through her private side-\nbusiness, she could write documents for proper performance of the contract.  She had, in her\ngovernment capacity, informed the contractor of the deficiencies she proposed to correct.  The Judge\nalso made findings and conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s actions in seeking permission to engage\nin an outside activity.  He found that Applicant gave limited information in response to repeated\nrequests for more information.  The ethics counselor told her that she did not have sufficient\ninformation to advise the supervisor.  Applicant went ahead and entered into the business\narrangement and accepted funds for activities.  \u201cApplicant clearly violated the ethical rules\nconcerning outside employment.\u201d (Decision at p. 12.) The Judge found for Applicant under\nGuideline F which is not at issue on appeal.  The Judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial\nevidence and are sustainable. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant failed to demonstrate mitigation.  Although the Judge\nconsidered the passage of time, the favorable testimony of her witnesses, and the acquittal, he\nconcluded that the nature and gravity of the conduct was not outweighed by the  evidence in\nmitigation.\nTo the extent that Applicant relies on the fact that she was acquitted of criminal charges, such\nreliance is misplaced. \u201cAlthough Applicant was acquitted at trial, a DOHA administrative hearing\nis not bound by the same presumptions and burden of proof applicable to criminal prosecutions\n[citations omitted]\u201d See ISCR Case No.08-02404 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2009).  Applicant asserts\nthat the Judge did not consider important matters in mitigation under Guideline J.  There is a\nrebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence.  Applicant has not\novercome this presumption.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\n\n3\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct under Guideline J and considered the possible application\nof relevant conditions and factors.  However, the Judge concluded that there was insufficient\nevidence to mitigate the Guideline J allegation.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the\nrecord. \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s claim that the Judge expanded the scope of the SOR without\namending it, the Board is not persuaded.  In the first place, the claim is vague and does specify what\nportion of the facts or issues were outside the scope of the allegation.  Applicant was on fair notice\nthat the 2001 issues were of security concern.  Applicant was represented by counsel at the hearing.\nApplicant does not allege nor does the Board find evidence that her previous counsel ever challenged\neither the scope of the SOR or the scope of the hearing.  Indeed, her counsel\u2019s opening statement\nrefers to various aspects of the 2000-2001 events.  Applicant has failed to demonstrate error on this\nclaim.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan         \nMichael Y.

After an investigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), dated January 22, 2008, for Applicant detailing security concerns for financial \nconsiderations under Guideline F, and for criminal conduct under Guideline J.1 The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.   \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 11, 2009, with a detailed \nexplanation of her finances which was dated January 29, 2009.  Applicant admitted the \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n1 The SOR was misdated as January 22, 2008.  From a reading of all other documents in the file, the \nactual date of the SOR is January 22, 2009.  There is no prejudice to Applicant from the erroneous date \non the SOR. \nJuly 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nsix allegations under Guideline F, and the one allegation under Guideline J.  She \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on April 6, 2009, and the case was assigned to me the next day.  DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on April 16, 2009, scheduling a hearing on May 12, 2009.  I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  Five documents were admitted as Court exhibits \nand used to establish requests for Administrative Notice of certain facts.  One witness \ntestified for the government.  The government offered 33 exhibits, marked government \nexhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 33, which were received without objection.  Gov. Ex. 34 \nwas marked but not moved by the government for admission.  Applicant submitted eight \nexhibits, marked as App. Ex. A-H received without objection.  Applicant and four \nwitnesses testified on her behalf.  The record was left open for both Department \nCounsel and Applicant to submit additional documents.  Department Counsel timely \nsubmitted one document, marked Gov. Ex. 35 and admitted without objection.  \nApplicant timely submitted three documents marked App. Ex. I-K admitted without \nobjection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 19, 2009.  Based \nupon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all factual allegations in the SOR.  After a thorough review of \nthe pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and has worked as a systems safety engineer for a \ndefense contractor for over a year.  She has never been married but has a daughter.  \nShe is a college graduate with degrees in both chemistry and chemical engineering \n(Gov. Ex. 1, Security clearance application, dated April 29, 2008).   \n \nApplicant started working as an engineer for government agencies after receiving \nher degrees.  She worked three years in her first position with the government as a \ngeneral engineer writing statements of work.  She received a security clearance for this \nposition.  She accepted a promotion to another government position at a different \nlocation conducting contract audits that she held for two years with a security clearance.  \nShe was promoted again to a staff quality assurance engineer position at another \nlocation where she conducted contract surveillance for the government.  She performed \nthis job for two years and held a security clearance.  She was again promoted this time \nto an Industrial Engineer position at a major Department of Defense agency.  She \nauthored policy and procedures and participated in development of performance \nimprovement criteria for the command's response for the Malcolm Baldridge award.  \nShe held a security clearance for this position.   \n \nApplicant transferred to the command's contract management activity.  She \nworked on the internal operations assessment team and conducted technical visits to \nfield activities to ensure the command was meeting the requirements for continuous \nprocess improvement.  She also audited the performance of government employees to \nensure that contractor personnel were meeting contract requirements.  She resigned \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthis position in November 2001.  She continued to hold a security clearance until she \nresigned (Tr. 53-67).   \n \nApplicant was basically unemployed from November 2001 until March 2003.  She \nwent to work for a government contractor in March 2003 as a quality assurance \nengineer for products being delivered under contract to the government.  She received \nan interim clearance upon commencing this employment.  She was laid off in \nSeptember 2004 when the contract was completed.  She worked in temporary positions \nuntil July 2005 when she started working as a quality coordinator for a private company \nnot working on any government contracts.  She left that position in October 2005 when \nshe started working for an engineering company as a technical lead for quality \nassurance on government contracts.  She again received an interim clearance.  She \ntransferred to her present employer in April 2008 as a safety systems engineer and \nsubmitted her SF 86 for permanent granting of a security clearance (Tr. 67-73).   \n \nApplicant's monthly net salary is $4,379.44, with monthly expenses of $1,938.32.  \nShe makes a scheduled monthly $800 payment on debts alleged in SOR 1.d and 1.e \nbringing her total monthly expenses to $2,738.32.  The monthly remainder in disposable \nor discretionary funds is $1,641.12 (App. Ex. D, Personal Financial Statement, \nundated).  Applicant also provided a letter from her landlord that she has rented an \napartment since July 2008, she is an excellent tenant, and she pays her rent on time \n(App. Ex. E, Letter, dated May 7, 2009).  Much of Applicant's debt was incurred \nbecause of her expense defending herself in a criminal trial in 2001/2002. \n \nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and credit reports, answers to interrogatories \nand court documents verify that Applicant filed for bankruptcy in August 1988 and her \ndebts were discharged in 1989 (SOR 1.a); a judgment was entered against her in \nSeptember 2001 for $2,309.70 (SOR 1.b); a judgment was entered against her from the \nsame creditor in the same court in February 2002 for $1,051.72 (SOR 1.c); two charged \noff accounts with a credit union for $20,491 and $9,683 (SOR 1.d and 1.e); and a home \nequity loan in collection for $9,049 (SOR 1.f; Gov. Ex. 2, Response to Interrogatories, \ndated November 21, 2008 with attachments; Gov. Ex. 3, Court Information sheet, \nundated; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated June 4, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, \ndated January 7, 2009). \n \nSOR allegation 1.a is for a bankruptcy.  Applicant admits that she filed a \nbankruptcy in August 1988 on the advice of her attorney and her debts were discharged \nshortly thereafter.  She notes that the bankruptcy was over 20 year ago and she has \nworked for the government for over 19 years since then and purchased a home in 1997 \n((Tr. 73-74; App. Ex. A, Response to SOR, dated January 29, 2009).   \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.b and 1.c are judgments in favor of the same retail \nstore.  Applicant admits to the debts but notes that she has only one account and one \ncredit card with the store.  She has not contacted the store but intends to contact them \nto establish a payment plan for the $1,051 debt which is the one she believes she owes.  \nShe will contest the other debt (Tr. 74-75).   \n\n \n4 \n \n \nDelinquent debts SOR 1.d and 1.e are to the same credit union for a car loan in \ndefault and for a ready cash loan in default.  She settled the car loan for $6,995.  The \nready cash loan was settled for $4,000.  Her total debt to the credit union is \napproximately $11,000.  Payments of $400 are being taken from her account each pay \nperiod to pay the settlement.  The first debit of $400 was on May 8, 2009 (Tr. 75-76; \nApp. Ex. J, Bank Letter, date May 15, 2009). \n \nDelinquent debt SOR 1.f is for a credit card in collection for $9,049.  Applicant \nsettled this account for $5,300 (App. Ex. C(a), Letter, dated February 4, 2009).  The \naccount was paid in full on April 24, 2009 (Tr. 76; App. Ex. C(b), Letter, dated May 7, \n2009).   \n \nApplicant was a management and engineering technical lead at a major \nDepartment of Defense contracting command.  She audited government engineers at \nfield sites to ensure that they monitored the contractors to insure they were performing \ntheir functions and meeting contract requirements.  As part of her function, she traveled \nto a field location in August 2000.  The government engineers at the field site were not \nperforming their functions well and had requested training from Applicant's command.  \nThe engineers picked a program for her to monitor with them.  One engineer picked a \nprogram manufacturing radar electronic systems and examined systems safety \nengineering.  Applicant and the government engineer met with the systems safety \nengineer for the contractor.  Applicant monitored the government engineer's \nsurveillance of the program to evaluate his meeting the government monitoring and \nsurveillance requirements.  Applicant returned to the field site in December 2000 to \nconduct another training session as scheduled.  On this visit, she and the government \nengineer examined the contractor's integrated logistics support procedures (ILS) for the \ncontract.  No ILS deficiencies were noted to the contractor's systems safety engineer.  \nApplicant returned to the field site again in January 2001.  Applicant noted she went \nalong only to monitor the actions of the government engineers and not to conduct \nsurveillance (Tr. 77-8, 123-125).  The sign-in log for the contractor showed that \nApplicant signed in as conducting surveillance (Gov. Ex. 8, Log, August 31, 2000 and \nDecember 13, 2000). \n \nA Department of Defense criminal investigator testified at the security clearance \nhearing on May 12, 2009, that he received a call from a contracting command attorney \ninforming him that she received a call from the government engineer at the field site \nApplicant visited.  The engineer related that he participated in a site visit to a contractor \nwith Applicant in December 2000 in which Applicant discussed with the contractor's \nsafety systems engineer the lack of contractor's ILS procedures.  The contractor's \nengineer related to him that Applicant took him aside and noted that the contractor \nneeded procedures written for the contract and she had a business on the side that \ncould help them write the procedures.  The contractor's engineer was concerned there \ncould have been a conflict of interest and wanted to advise government representatives \nof Applicant's approach to the contractor (Tr. 28-31). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe criminal investigator testified he interviewed the contractor's and government \nengineers at the field site concerning Applicant's action.  He determined that the \ninformation provided him by the government attorney was accurate and that Applicant \nprovided the contractor's engineer with a business card to contact her if he needed her \nto write procedures for him.  He also learned from the on-site government engineers \nand the contractor's engineer that they did not agree with Applicant that ILS procedures \nneed to be written for the contract since the procedures were not required under the \ncontract.  He learned that Applicant directed the government engineer she was \nmonitoring and training to prepare and issue a Corrective Action Report (CAR) to the \ncontractor noting the lack of an ILS.   \n \nThe criminal investigator contacted Applicant posing as a representative of the \ncontractor to take her up on her offer to write ILS procedures.  The criminal investigator \nhad the contractor's engineer contact Applicant by both e-mail and telephone requesting \ninformation from her on her efforts to write ILS procedures.  Applicant returned to the \nengineer several proposals on the hours needed and cost for the effort.  The contractor \nand Applicant agreed on a contract to provide the services (Gov. Ex. 22, Purchase \nOrder, dated February 13, 2001).  The criminal investigator also posed as a contractor \nemployee and spoke with Applicant and recorded their conversations under court order.  \nApplicant and Applicant's partner in the writing endeavor who was also a government \nemployee in Applicant's command returned to the field site in February 2001.  They met \nwith the criminal investigator posing as a contractor employee, provided the investigator \nwith the written ILS procedure, and received payment by check of $12,000 (Tr. 31-46).  \nIn an e-mail to the criminal investigator who Applicant thought was a contractor \nemployee, she told him \"About the CAR, have [contractor's engineer] send a message \nto [government engineer] asking him for a copy of the closed CAR.  I should keep as \nlow a profile on this as possible\" (Gov. Ex. 20, e-mail, dated February 15, 2001, \nEmphasis added) \n \nApplicant was indicted in September 2001 for participating personally and \nsubstantially as a government employee in a contract in which she had a financial \ninterest in violation of 18 United States Code Sections 208 (a) and 2 (Gov. Ex. 6, \nIndictment, dated September 19, 2001).2  Applicant was tried in federal court in \nNovember 2001 and found not guilty at a jury trial (Gov. Ex. 7, Judgment of Acquittal, \ndated March 8, 2002).  Applicant had to use the funds in her thrift savings account to \npay her attorney (Tr. 115-116). \n \nApplicant testified at the security clearance hearing on May 12, 2009, that there \nis a difference between writing a plan and writing a procedure.  A plan tells the \ngovernment what the end result of what the hardware will do and how the contractor will \nbuild the hardware for delivery.  A procedure is an internal document telling the \ncontractor employees how to do their job.  Applicant offered to write procedures and not \nplans for the contractor not related to any government contracts.  She made the offer \nbecause she wanted to get into writing procedures (Tr. 84-89).   \n                                                          \n2 Administrative notice is taken of the statute (See, Court Exhibit 2). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nA CAR was issued to the contractor by the government field engineer on January \n5, 2001 (Gov. Ex. 9, Letter, dated January 5, 2001).  Applicant testified that she does \nnot have the authority to issue a CAR nor direct the government engineer at the field \nsite, who had the authority to issue the CAR, to issue such a document.  Applicant was \nunaware of the program mentioned in the letter requiring the ILS.  She was not aware of \nthe CAR until notified by the contractor's engineer that one had been issued.  Applicant \nalso testified that the letter did not constitute a CAR.  Applicant in her visits to the \ncontractor never observed a deficiency requiring a CAR.  She did note during her visits, \nand informed the commander, that the government engineers were deficient in \nmonitoring, controlling, and surveillance of the contractors.  Based on her evaluation, \nshe believed the performance rating of some of the engineers dropped.  She believes \nthat the engineers had an issue with her and her evaluation (Tr. 93-102).  The \ncontractor in answer to the January 5, 2001 letter, informed the government engineer \nthe CAR was not required because they had complied with the contract requirements \n(Gov. Ex. 10, Letter, dated January 18, 2001).   \n \nApplicant further testified that the contractor's engineer notified her that the CAR \nhad been issued by the field site government engineer.  She was surprised because \nshe had not observed any deficiencies during her visits.  The contractor's engineer told \nher that he had not heard back from the government engineer since the CAR was \nissued.  Applicant told him that she would call the government engineer and tell him to \nrespond to the contractor's engineer.  He also asked her to draft internal company \nprocedures telling company employees how to do their job (Tr. 102-107).  Applicant \ncommunicated her actions with the engineer by e-mail and agreed on the product and \ndelivery (See, Gov. Ex. 11 through 24, e-mails, letters, and receipts).  The product was \ninvoiced by Applicant (Gov. Ex. 24, Invoice, dated February 13, 2001), delivered (Gov. \nex. 25, Receipt, dated February 20, 2001, and paid (Gov. ex. 26, Check, dated \nFebruary 15, 2001).   \n \nApplicant immediately after being asked by the contractor's engineer to write \nprocedures notified her supervisor of the request for outside employment.  She then \nsent an e-mail to the ethics counselors.  Applicant knew the procedures in place at the \ntime for outside employment.  If the request concerned a contract she was involved in, \nshe had to recuse herself from the contract.  If the employment was general \nemployment by a contractor, she had to notify her supervisor and the ethics counselor \nand receive permission from the supervisor.  She believes she received permission \nbecause her supervisor notified the next person higher in the chain of command that he \ndid not see anything wrong with Applicant's outside employment writing procedures for \nthe contractor.  She continually communicated with the ethics counselor by e-mail who \ndid not understand what Applicant was trying to do (Tr. 107-115, 117-122).   \n \nThe government presented memorandum and e-mails concerning outside \nemployment exchanged between Applicant, her supervisor, and the ethics counselor.  \nApplicant requested approval for outside employment writing documents for the defense \ncontractor in an e-mail at 1456 hours on January 30, 2001.  Her supervisor asked the \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncommand's ethics counselor for advice at 1502 hours, January 30, 2001.  The ethics \ncounselor advised that more information was needed about the employment from \nApplicant by e-mail at 1824 hours on February 1, 2001.  The supervisor requested \nApplicant to provide additional information at 0741 hours on February 2, 2001.  \nApplicant provided one sentence of additional information to her supervisor at 0843 \nhours on February 2, 2001.  The message stated that Applicant would work for a \ncompany, Group S (Gov. Ex. 30, e-mails, at 2 and 3).  Applicant noted that Group S's \npresident has been a friend of hers since 1989.  She was also a government employee \nfor the same command as Applicant.  Group S was a government contractor providing \ntransportation services.  The President of Group S assisted and worked on providing \nthe procedure guides to the contractor.  She accompanied Applicant to deliver the final \nproduct (Tr. 122- 126).   \n \nThe ethics counselor, by e-mail at 1120 hours, February 2, 2001, responded that \nthe additional information was not sufficient and recommended that Applicant draft a \nmemorandum describing exactly what work she would perform for the defense \ncontractor.  Appellant's supervisor responded by e-mail at 1149 hours, February 2, \n2001, with additional information about Group S that he had received from Applicant in \nresponse to his own questions.  He also provided information on the role his office and \nApplicant played in contract supervision.  He further noted \"I do not see any conflict of \ninterest in [Applicant's] proposed employment.  She has assured me that no \nGovernment resources will be used to perform her employment.\"  He also noted that \nshe told him the employment would not conflict with her duties to the command (Gov. \nEx. 30, e-mails at 1). \n \nThe ethics counselor was still not satisfied with the information and informed \nApplicant that more information was needed by e-mail at 1040 hours February 16, 2001.  \nThe ethics counselor wrote \"Absent more detailed information from you, I am not in a \nposition to make a recommendation one way or another regarding approval.\"  Applicant \ntestified that she interpreted the statement in her supervisor's e-mail that he did not see \nany conflict of interest as the required approval for outside employment (Tr. 118-120).  \nApplicant delivered the procedures to the contractor on February 20, 2001. \n \nThe Joint Ethics Regulation required Applicant to obtain written approval from an \n\"Agency Designee\" before engaging in any business activity or compensated outside \nemployment with a prohibited source.  Prior to taking final action on such a request the \nAgency Designee is required to consult with the local ethics counselor for advice.  The \n\"Agency Designee\" is Applicant's supervisor (DoD Directive 5500.7, dated August 30, \n1993) \n \nAn Applicant witness who is the government official supervising the team \nApplicant served on as a contractor testified that she provided inspections for safety and \nquality.  He does not believe Applicant is a security risk and feels she is trustworthy and \nethical.  He has traveled with her and he felt comfortable enough with Applicant's \nabilities to turn certain areas over to her without supervision (Tr. 146-153). \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant's co-worker testified she has worked with Applicant for over a year.  \nShe has no doubt as to Applicant's trustworthiness and ethics.  She does not believe \nshe is a security risk. (Tr. 153-157). \n \nAnother witness testified that she has known Applicant for over four years and \nworked with her when they both worked for a private business.  Applicant always had a \ngood working relationship with co-workers and customers.  The witness socialized with \nApplicant and goes to church with her.  She has never seen any conduct that would \naffect her ability to hold a security clearance.  She is reliable and dependable (Tr. 157-\n162). \n \nThe president of Applicant's company testified that he tries to keep personal \ncontact with his employees.  She has received excellent evaluations and even a \ncommendation for her work with the government.  He has served as a facilities security \nofficer and has held a security clearance since 1984.  He is aware of security \nrequirements.  He has no reason to doubt Applicant's fitness for a security clearance.  \nBefore hiring Applicant, his company conducted a background investigation and did not \nfind any issues.  He is aware of her trial for conflict of interest but does not believe the \ncharges affect her ability to have access to classified information.  He finds her \ntrustworthy and knows she follows the rules (Tr. 162-173). \n \nApplicant's former co-worker wrote that he has known her as a government \nemployee for over 20 years.  He worked closely with her on a number of projects.  He is \nimpressed with her integrity, forthrightness, and ability to follow procedures.  He states \nthat Applicant without doubt is trustworthy and loyal to her country.  He has no \nhesitation to grant her access to classified information (App. Ex. F, Letter, dated May 8, \n2009).   \n \nAppellant's lawyer for her criminal trial notes that the case against her was weak \nand the government witnesses were not good.  He characterized the criminal \ninvestigation as poor.  He considers Applicant to be a friend and she is honest, \nforthright, and dedicated to her work and country (App. Ex. G, Letter, dated May 11, \n2009).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n\n \n9 \n \n \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  The delinquent debts that Applicant admits and are listed in credit reports \nare a security concern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \n\u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations).  Applicant had difficulty meeting her financial obligations \nbecause of the expense of her criminal trial and the periods of unemployment after the \ntrial.   \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances).  Applicant filed bankruptcy over 20 year ago and her debts \nwere discharged.  Bankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of resolving debt.  Since \nthe bankruptcy was filed and completed many years ago, it is no longer of security \nconcern.  Of the five remaining debts, Applicant has paid one and settled two others \nwith the same creditor.  She is paying the settlement according to a plan.  The two \nremaining debts are with the same creditor.  Applicant believes there should only be \none debt since she has only had one account with the creditor.  She is contacting them \nand making arrangement to pay the remaining debt of about $1,000.  Since there is still \noutstanding delinquent debt even though being paid, the debts are current.  Her debts \narose because of the loss of employment and the need to use her funds to defend a \ncriminal action.  She acted responsibly by paying some of her debts when she became \nfinancially solvent and contacting her creditors to settle and pay her remaining debts.  \nShe acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant has the means to pay her delinquent debts.  She paid one debt, is paying two \nother debts by settlement agreement, and has contacted the remaining creditor to \ndispute one of the listed debts and to pay the last one.  She has a plan of attack to \nstabilize her debts and be current with her payments.  Applicant's actions establish that \nshe is financially responsible.  She has mitigated security concerns raised by her \nfinancial situation. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \n\n \n11 \n \n \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations (AG \u00b6 30).  Appellant was indicted and tried \nin federal court for the criminal offense of conflict of interest.  These facts raise Criminal \nConduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple \nlesser offenses), and CD DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted).  The alleged offense is serious.  Even though the charge may have resulted \nin a finding of not guilty, it is still an allegation of criminal conduct that raises a security \nconcern.  \n \n \nThe government produced substantial evidence to establish the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).  The burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the criminal conduct (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15).  An \napplicant has the burden to refute an established allegation or prove a mitigating \ncondition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)).   \n \n \nAppellant has raised by her testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) \u00b6 32 (a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment);  CC MC \u00b6 \n32 (c) (evidence that the person did not commit the offense); and CC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there \nis evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse, or restitution, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement).   \n \n \nApplicant was acquitted of the offense after an extensive trial and findings by a \njury.  However, this does not end the inquiry.  Applicant states that her conduct was not \na conflict of interest.  She denies that she directed a CAR be initiated against the \ncontractor and then she offered her services to the contractor to write the procedures \nrequired by the CAR for them.  She attributes the issue to her informing the field \nengineers' supervisor that their performance was lacking and the lower performance \nrating.  However, it was the contractor's engineer who Applicant spoke to and offered \nher services that was upset about the issue enough to notify the government of a \npotential conflict of interest.  Applicant admitted that she presented her business card to \nthe contractor's engineer and told him she was in the business of writing the required \ndocuments.  Applicant also told the investigator that she should keep a low profile \nindicating that her activities were not proper.  This was criminal activity.  While Applicant \nwas found not guilty of a criminal violation by a jury, her actions were sufficient to create \ndoubt about her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.   \n \n \nApplicant's actions in obtaining permission to engage in outside activity and \nbusiness are of equal importance.  Applicant had been a government employee for over \n19 years at the time of the incident.  She had been briefed on ethical issues every year.  \nShe knew the rules and procedures.  Her testimony that the comment by her supervisor \nthat he saw no conflict of interest amounted to the required written approval is without \nmerit and not credible.  The string of e-mail correspondence between Applicant, her \n\n \n12 \n \n \nsupervisor, and the ethics counselor clearly shows that there was concern by the \nsupervisor and ethics counselor about the Applicant's requested outside employment. \nApplicant was repeatedly asked to provide more information and she only provided \nlimited information.  The ethics counselor told her that she did not have sufficient \ninformation to properly advise the supervisor.  Applicant went ahead and entered into \nthe business arrangement and accepted funds from the contractor for her activities.  \nApplicant clearly violated the ethical rules concerning outside employment.  As a long \nterm government employee, she knew she did not have permission to engage in the \nactivity.  She also knew because of the concern of the ethics counselor, that she \nprobably would not gain that permission.  While the supervisor had the decisional \nauthority, he would not act unless he had clear approval from the ethics counselor.  \nApplicant's action in gong forward with the outside activity without prior written approval \nis a clear indication of Applicant's inability or unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \n \n \nThe circumstances facing Applicant concerning outside employment were not \nunusual in that she deliberately sought out the business. Her action could recur in that \nshe could seek business from others if she wanted.  Her actions cast doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness and good judgment.  There is some evidence of successful \nrehabilitation.  Her past supervisors and co-workers, and the president of her company \nestablish that she is a good, willing, honest, and forthright employee.  However, this \ndoes not offset the fact that Applicant used her governmental position to get outside \nwork from a government contractor and continued with that work even though she did \nnot have prior permission from her supervisor to engage in such activity.  She willingly \ndid not comply with the ethical laws and regulations.  This is a clear indication that she \nalso would not follow the rules and regulation concerning the safeguarding of classified \ninformation.  For this reason, she has failed to mitigate security concerns for her \ncriminal conduct.   \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative jdge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nAppellant established a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including \nevidence of actual debt reduction through payment of debts.  She is not required, as a \nmatter of law, to establish that she paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR.  All \nthat is required is that she demonstrates a plan to resolve her financial problems and \ntake significant action to implement that plan. The entirety of her financial situation and \nher actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which her plan to \nreduce her outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic.  Available, reliable \ninformation about the person's behavior, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be considered in reaching a determination.  There is no requirement that a plan \nprovide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously.  Rather, a reasonable \nplan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts one at a time.   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant established a meaningful \ntrack record of debt payment by presenting sufficient information to show she is taking \nsufficient, consistent, reasonable, and responsible action to resolve her financial issues.  \nShe contacted all of the creditors listed on her credit reports, paid some of her debts, \nsettled others and making payments according to the settlement, and is trying to resolve \nthe last remaining small debt.  Appellant is not financially overextended and she is living \nwithin her means.   \n \nApplicant's criminal activity, even though a finding of not guilty was entered after \na jury trial, is still a security concern.  She willingly and deliberately sought outside \nemployment from a government contractor amounting to a potential conflict of interest \nfor a government employee.  She knew the rules and procedures to be granted \nauthority to engage in outside employment but she acted without securing the required \nwritten permission.  These actions show her poor judgment, unreliability, and \nuntrustworthiness.  She has not shown an ability and willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. This aspect of her life leads to the conclusion that she can \ndisplay the same characteristics concerning the safeguarding of classified information. \n \nOverall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations, but has not mitigated security concerns for criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n\n \n14 \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Crean denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.\nApplicant appealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge failed to consider\nproperly various matters in mitigation under Guideline J; (b) whether the Judge expanded the scope\nof the sole allegation under Guideline J; and (c) whether certain of the Judge\u2019s factual findings are\n\n2\nsupported by substantial record evidence.  For the following reasons, the Board affirms the Judge\u2019s\nadverse security clearance decision. \n The Judge found that, in 2001, Applicant was indicted, tried, and acquitted for participating\npersonally and substantially as a government employee in a contract in which she had a financial\ninterest (18 U.S.C. 208 (a) and 2).  The Judge made extensive findings regarding the underlying\nconduct in 2000 and 2001 that led the to the charge.   Specifically, he found she violated federal\n\u201cconflict of interest rules\u201d by informing a government contractor that, through her private side-\nbusiness, she could write documents for proper performance of the contract.  She had, in her\ngovernment capacity, informed the contractor of the deficiencies she proposed to correct.  The Judge\nalso made findings and conclusions regarding Applicant\u2019s actions in seeking permission to engage\nin an outside activity.  He found that Applicant gave limited information in response to repeated\nrequests for more information.  The ethics counselor told her that she did not have sufficient\ninformation to advise the supervisor.  Applicant went ahead and entered into the business\narrangement and accepted funds for activities.  \u201cApplicant clearly violated the ethical rules\nconcerning outside employment.\u201d (Decision at p. 12.) The Judge found for Applicant under\nGuideline F which is not at issue on appeal.  The Judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial\nevidence and are sustainable. \nThe Judge concluded that Applicant failed to demonstrate mitigation.  Although the Judge\nconsidered the passage of time, the favorable testimony of her witnesses, and the acquittal, he\nconcluded that the nature and gravity of the conduct was not outweighed by the  evidence in\nmitigation.\nTo the extent that Applicant relies on the fact that she was acquitted of criminal charges, such\nreliance is misplaced. \u201cAlthough Applicant was acquitted at trial, a DOHA administrative hearing\nis not bound by the same presumptions and burden of proof applicable to criminal prosecutions\n[citations omitted]\u201d See ISCR Case No.08-02404 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2009).  Applicant asserts\nthat the Judge did not consider important matters in mitigation under Guideline J.  There is a\nrebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence.  Applicant has not\novercome this presumption.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone compel the\nJudge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh\nthe evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable\nevidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007).  A party\u2019s\ndisagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different\ninterpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or\nreached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct under Guideline J and considered the possible application\nof relevant conditions and factors.  However, the Judge concluded that there was insufficient\nevidence to mitigate the Guideline J allegation.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the\nrecord. \n\n3\nRegarding Applicant\u2019s claim that the Judge expanded the scope of the SOR without\namending it, the Board is not persuaded.  In the first place, the claim is vague and does specify what\nportion of the facts or issues were outside the scope of the allegation.  Applicant was on fair notice\nthat the 2001 issues were of security concern.  Applicant was represented by counsel at the hearing.\nApplicant does not allege nor does the Board find evidence that her previous counsel ever challenged\neither the scope of the SOR or the scope of the hearing.  Indeed, her counsel\u2019s opening statement\nrefers to various aspects of the 2000-2001 events.  Applicant has failed to demonstrate error on this\nclaim.\nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Michael Y. Ra\u2019anan         \nMichael Y.

He is married and has two children, ages 17 and 7. His children are native-born citizens of the U.S., and Applicant describes his wife and children as fully 4 integrated into American society, to include his daughter\u2019s participation in Girl Scouts.5 This is the first time he has applied for a security clearance. Applicant was born, raised, and educated in China. His educational background in China includes a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He then spent the next three to four years in the 1980s working as an assistant professor for a Chinese university. He entered the U.S. on a student visa in the late 1980s, and he enrolled as a graduate student at a U.S. state university. Also, he worked as a teaching assistant at the same university. He earned a Ph.D. in physics in 1997. Since then, he has worked as an engineer except for two brief periods of unemployment. He has worked for his current employer, the federal contractor, since 2007, and he completed a security-clearance application in October 2007. H",

The action\nis based on foreign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s ties or connections\nto China. The record contains substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s family ties to China,\nand those ties create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. The record contains insufficient evidence to\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Accordingly, as explained in more\ndetail below, this case is decided against Applicant. \nSeptember 8, 2009\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\ndated February 20, 1960, as amended, and DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive). In addition, because the SOR\nwas issued after September 1, 2006, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access\nto Classified Information (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, then made\neffective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to this case. They supersede or replace\nthe guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit 3; Tr. 26\u201332. \n2\n Exhibit 3, Attachment 3, pp. 43\u201353.\n3\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense\n1\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant on February 10, 2009. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the\nfactual basis for the action. The SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline B for\nforeign influence. The SOR also recommended submitting the case to an administrative\njudge for a determination to deny or revoke Applicant\u2019s security-clearance eligibility.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 8, 2009, and he requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on May 4, 2009. The hearing took place as scheduled on\nJune 15, 2009. The testimony of Applicant was taken, Government Exhibits 1 through 3\nwere admitted, and Applicant Exhibits 1 through 38 were admitted. The record was kept\nopen to allow Applicant to submit a copy of his wife\u2019s U.S. passport. He did so in a\ntimely manner, and that document is admitted without objections as Applicant Exhibit\n39. The hearing transcript (Tr.) was received June 23, 2009. \nProcedural Matters\nAdministrative or official notice was taken of certain facts concerning the\nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (China) as set forth in Department Counsel\u2019s written\nrequest.  In summary, the most pertinent of those facts are as follows: (1) China is ruled\n2\nby an authoritarian government dominated and controlled by the Chinese Communist\nParty; (2) China is actively engaged in intelligence gathering (industrial and military) that\ntargets U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a poor record of human\nrights. To cite but one example, according to the U.S. Department of State 2008 Human\nRights Report, Chinese authorities continue to commit serious human rights abuses in\nTibet.    \n3\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted, with explanations, the SOR allegations except for the\nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d asserting his wife is a dual citizen of the U.S. and China. Based\non the record as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\n\n Applicant Exhibits 33 and 34. \n4\n Applicant Exhibit 35. \n5\n Applicant Exhibits 6 and 7. \n6\n3\nApplicant is a 48-year-old principal systems engineer who is employed by a\nfederal contractor. He is married and has two children, ages 17 and 7. His children are\nnative-born citizens of the U.S.,  and Applicant describes his wife and children as fully\n4\nintegrated into American society, to include his daughter\u2019s participation in Girl Scouts.5\nThis is the first time he has applied for a security clearance. \nApplicant was born, raised, and educated in China. His educational background\nin China includes a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. He\nthen spent the next three to four years in the 1980s working as an assistant professor\nfor a Chinese university. He entered the U.S. on a student visa in the late 1980s, and he\nenrolled as a graduate student at a U.S. state university. Also, he worked as a teaching\nassistant at the same university. He earned a Ph.D. in physics in 1997. Since then, he\nhas worked as an engineer except for two brief periods of unemployment. He has\nworked for his current employer, the federal contractor, since 2007, and he completed a\nsecurity-clearance application in October 2007.  \nHe obtained U.S. citizenship in 2001. This means that he is no longer a Chinese\ncitizen by operation of Chinese nationality law.  He obtained his first U.S. passport in\n6\n2002, and he used it for all foreign travel. His Chinese passport expired in 2004, and he\ndid not renew it.\nConcerning the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, the record establishes the\nfollowing:\n1.\nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens of and residents in China. Applicant\nhas regular contact with them via telephone calls. Both parents are former\nprofessors at a Chinese university. Both retired in the 1990s after more than 30\nyears of work. And both receive a pension based on their decades-long\nemployment. \n2.\nApplicant\u2019s sister is a citizen of and a resident in China. Applicant has less\ncontact with his sister, perhaps once a year, via telephone calls. His sister is\nemployed as a sales representative for a company that is headquartered in the\nU.S. \n3.\nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen of and a resident in China. He is a medical\ndoctor who works as a surgeon in several hospitals. Applicant\u2019s contact with his\nbrother-in-law is limited.\n\n Applicant Exhibit 39. \n7\n Applicant Exhibit 36. \n8\n Applicant Exhibits 8\u201315 concern the Chinese real estate matters. \n9\n Tr. 68\u201371.\n10\n Tr. 90. \n11\n Applicant Exhibits 16\u201331 concern the U.S. financial assets. \n12\n Applicant Exhibit 32.\n13\n4\n4.\nApplicant\u2019s wife, like him, was born in China and lost her Chinese citizenship by\noperation of Chinese nationality law when she became a U.S. citizen in 2000.\nShe obtained her first U.S. passport in July 2000,  and she has used it for all\n7\nforeign travel, including travel to China. Also, like her husband, she worked as an\nassistant professor in China for several years in the 1980s. Her immediate family,\nto include her mother, lives in the U.S. Her father is deceased. Her mother is a\nU.S. citizen.  She is now employed as a software engineer for a large bank. \n8\n5.\nIn the summer of 2008, Applicant and his wife and children traveled to China to\nvisit his family and attend the Olympics. While there, Applicant attended a school\nreunion and had contact with 20 to 30 former classmates. Applicant described\nthe event as a rare occasion because he has had little to no contact with them for\nmany years. He has had no contact with his former classmates since returning\nfrom the trip. Applicant reported this trip to his company security office. \n6.\nApplicant and his wife own two apartments in China, and the apartments have an\napproximate value of about $175,000.  Applicant has not lived in the apartments,\n9\nhe does not intend to do so, and he does not plan to live in China. He bought the\napartments for his parents to live in. He bought the first apartment in 2004. The\napartment was on the sixth floor and the building lacked an elevator, which\npresented problems as his parents aged. So, in 2008, Applicant bought another\napartment on the second floor with an elevator. His parents contributed money to\nthe purchase of both apartments, and Applicant estimates that about one-fourth\nof the equity belongs to them. The first apartment is vacant, and Applicant is in\nthe process of selling it. He may transfer ownership of the second apartment to\nhis parents, but doing so will require a trip to China as the transaction must be\ndone in person.  \nIn addition to the 2008 trip, Applicant made three other trips to China during the\nperiod 2000\u20132006.  The main purpose of the trips was to visit his parents.\n10\nApplicant estimates the net worth of U.S. financial assets at about $880,000.11\nThe assets consist of a primary residence, two rental properties, and financial and\nretirement accounts.  He is in the process of buying a third rental property.  Together,\n12\n13\n\n Applicant Exhibit 38. \n14\n See Applicant Exhibits 1\u20135. \n15\n Applicant Exhibit 37. \n16\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n17\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n18\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n19\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n20\n5\nhe and his wife have an annual gross income of about $200,000. For example, their\nadjusted gross income for 2007 was $229,086, which is more than the value of the two\napartments in China.14\nApplicant appears to be a law-abiding person of good character.  Three former\n15\nor current coworkers submitted letters of recommendation on Applicant\u2019s behalf. These\nindividuals vouch for Applicant\u2019s integrity, honesty, trustworthiness, work ethic,\nprofessional expertise, and willingness to follow rules. To that end, Applicant completed\nnumerous training courses for his current employment. The courses included subjects\nsuch as conflicts of interest, disclosure of material information, information assurance,\nand security.  \n16\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n17\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n18\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n19\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n20\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n21\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n22\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n23\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n24\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n25\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n26\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n27\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7, and 8 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n28\nconditions). \n6\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n21\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n22\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n23\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n24\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.25\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.26\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n27\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence,  the suitability of an applicant may be\n28\nquestioned or put into doubt due to an applicant\u2019s foreign connections and interests.\nThe overall concern under the guideline is that:\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 6. \n29\n See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8,\n30\n2001).\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 7(a).\n31\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 7(e). \n32\n7\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.29\nOf course, the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is\nnot\u2014as a matter of law\u2014disqualifying under Guideline B. But if only one relative resides\nin a foreign country and an applicant has contact with that relative, this factor alone is\nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the\ncompromise of classified information.30\nBased on the record, there are two disqualifying conditions that could raise\nsecurity concerns and may be disqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case:\nContact with a foreign family member, business, or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a foreign country\nif that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  and \n31\nA substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject\nthe individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.32\nHere, the two disqualifying conditions apply based on (1) Applicant\u2019s family ties to\nhis mother, father, and sister in China, and (2) his financial or property interests in\nChina. Applicant has ties of affection, emotion, or obligation to his parents as\ndemonstrated by the multiple trips to China to visit his parents. Those ties are further\ndemonstrated by Applicant\u2019s actions in purchasing the apartments for his parents.\nThese circumstances create the potential for a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. This is especially so given that the\nforeign country in question is China, which presents real-world concerns. It is not merely\nhypothetical to suggest that a brutal communist government such as China\u2019s would use\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 8(a) \u2013 (f).  \n33\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 8(a). \n34\n8\nApplicant\u2019s family ties to China as leverage in an attempt to pursue intelligence\ngathering. Given these circumstances, Applicant\u2019s relationships with his parents and\nsister are exploitable relationships in a foreign influence context. \nThe guideline also provides the certain facts and circumstances may mitigate\nforeign influence security concerns. The six mitigating conditions  under the guideline\n33\nare:\nThe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;\nThere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;\nContact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence\nor exploitation;\nThe foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or\nare approved by the cognizant security authority;\nThe individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements\nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons,\ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; or \nThe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not\nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual.\n \nThe first, third, and sixth mitigating conditions are most pertinent to the facts of this case\nand will be discussed below. The others do not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe first mitigating condition  does not apply because Applicant\u2019s family ties to\n34\nChina are of sufficient magnitude or strength to negate it. As noted above, there is a\npossibility that elements within China could attempt to use his family ties as leverage in\nintelligence gathering. But Applicant\u2019s spouse is not a dual citizen with China, and so,\n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 8(c).\n35\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 8(f).\n36\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n37\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n38\n9\nApplicant\u2019s relationship with her does not create any undue foreign influence.\nAccordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.d is decided for Applicant. \nThe third mitigating condition  applies to Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law in China due\n35\nto the limited nature of the contacts or ties. It also applies to Applicant\u2019s casual and\ninfrequent contacts with the 20 or 30 classmates he socialized with at a school reunion\nin 2008. This was an isolated event, and he has had no ongoing contacts with any of\nthose individuals. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e are decided for Applicant. \nThe sixth mitigating condition  applies to Applicant\u2019s ownership of two\n36\napartments in China. He is now in the process of selling one and may transfer\nownership of the other to his parents. Moreover, the value of the Chinese\napartments\u2014when compared with the value of the U.S. financial and property\ninterests\u2014is such that it is unlikely to result in a conflict or be used for foreign\nexploitation. Applicant could abandon his interests in the apartments and it would not\nhave a substantial effect on his overall financial situation. Accordingly, SOR \u00b6 1.f is\ndecided for Applicant. \nTo sum up, this is not a case of \u201cdivided loyalties\u201d  with an applicant who has\n37\none foot in the U.S. and one foot in his native country. The record shows Applicant has\nboth feet firmly rooted in the U.S., and that he has significant contacts and ties to the\nU.S. Looking forward, it is highly unlikely that Applicant will change course. But\nApplicant is in the unfortunate situation where he has family ties to a foreign country that\nis ruled by a brutal communist government. Although Applicant appears to have\nstrength of character and integrity, his family ties to China create a heightened risk of\nexploitation that cannot be ruled out. These circumstances are contrary to the clearly-\nconsistent standard I am required to apply. Accordingly, Guideline B is decided against\nApplicant. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the nine-factor whole-\nperson concept.38\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the security concerns under Guideline B. Applicant did not meet his ultimate\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n10\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\n \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.      \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 36-year-old data entry technician employed by a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since March 2008. He previously worked for a private company as an equipment operator from February 1995 to July 2004, and as a warehouse foreman in Kuwait from July 2004 to December 2007. He has never held a security clearance. Applicant\u2019s e-QIP reflects that he has been married since November 2005 and has no children. It also reflects a previous marriage in November 1990, but it does not reflect the date of his divorce (GX 1 at 21). The delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, totaling $16,038, are being handled by a debt settlement program. Applicant has made one payment of $375 to the attorney handling his program. The payment was due on December 21, 2008, but was made two days later (GX 4 at 4-6; GX 6 at 6). There is no evidence of subsequent payments in January or February 2009. The delinquent debt for $5,352, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, arose when Applicant co- signed a car loan for his ex-brother-in-law, who failed to make the payments. The car was repossessed (GX 4 at 7-10). In response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a copy of an email exchange in which his ex-brother-in-law acknowledged responsibility for the debt and promised to start making \u201cminor payments\u201d as soon as he starts working.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2\n \nApplicant received the SOR on January 5, 2009; answered it on January 15, \n2009; and requested determination on the record without a hearing. Department \nCounsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on February 4, 2009. On February 5, \n2009, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, \nwho was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on \nFebruary 12, 2009, and he timely submitted three documents on March 12, 2009. The \ncase was assigned to me on March 26, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c. \nHis admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old data entry technician employed by a defense \ncontractor. He has worked for his current employer since March 2008. He previously \nworked for a private company as an equipment operator from February 1995 to July \n2004, and as a warehouse foreman in Kuwait from July 2004 to December 2007. He \nhas never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP reflects that he has been married since November 2005 and \nhas no children. It also reflects a previous marriage in November 1990, but it does not \nreflect the date of his divorce (GX 1 at 21). \n \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, totaling $16,038, are being \nhandled by a debt settlement program. Applicant has made one payment of $375 to the \nattorney handling his program. The payment was due on December 21, 2008, but was \nmade two days later (GX 4 at 4-6; GX 6 at 6). There is no evidence of subsequent \npayments in January or February 2009. \n \n \nThe delinquent debt for $5,352, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, arose when Applicant co-\nsigned a car loan for his ex-brother-in-law, who failed to make the payments. The car \nwas repossessed (GX 4 at 7-10). In response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a copy \nof an email exchange in which his ex-brother-in-law acknowledged responsibility for the \ndebt and promised to start making \u201cminor payments\u201d as soon as he starts working. \nThere is no evidence that any payments have been made or that the ex-brother-in-law \nhas started working. \n \n \nThe delinquent debt for $34,981, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, arose from a home \nmortgage that was foreclosed. The court records in the FORM reflect that no deficiency \nwas assessed against Applicant. Department Counsel conceded the debt was satisfied \nby the foreclosure sale. \n \n \nA personal financial statement submitted by Applicant in response to DOHA \ninterrogatories reflects a net monthly household income of $4,338, expenses of $2,198, \n\n \n3\ndebt payments of $839, and a net remainder of $1,301 (GX 6 at 4). The debts alleged in \nthe SOR are not included in the personal financial statement. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n\n \n4\n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts totalling $56,371. The concern under this \nguideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ \nAG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.@ The \nevidence reflects that the delinquent home mortgage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was satisfied \nby the foreclosure sale, and I have resolved that allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. I have \nconsidered the foreclosure, however, in determining whether Applicant has \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d I conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), shifting the burden to him to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s debts are \nmultiple and not yet resolved. With the possible exception of the car loan, they did not \noccur under circumstances that are unlikely to recur. All the debts, including the car \nloan, cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \n\n \n5\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the person=s \ncontrol and responsible conduct, must be established. The failure of Applicant\u2019s ex-\nbrother-in-law to make payments on the car loan was a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. It appears that Applicant reacted responsibly when he learned about the \ndelinquent debt, by contacting the creditor and his ex-brother-in-law to find out what \nhappened. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the car loan but not for the other \ndelinquent debts.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant \nhas engaged a lawyer and enrolled in a debt settlement program, but the program does \nnot include the delinquent car loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Furthermore, Applicant has not \nestablished a track record of timely payments under the program. He responded to the \nFORM in March 2009, but he submitted no evidence that he made the January and \nFebruary payments due under the program. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is not established.  \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). Good faith means acting in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 \nWL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). I conclude this mitigating condition is not \nestablished. Applicant has not established a record of compliance with his debt \nsettlement program. No payments have been made on the delinquent car loan. The \ndelinquent mortgage was not resolved through any voluntary action by Applicant, but \nrather by involuntary foreclosure and sale of the house. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \n\n \n6\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult with a steady employment record. He has offered no \nexplanation for his inability to make his home mortgage payments. His financial history \nraises doubt whether he will comply with his debt settlement program. He has not \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns based \non his financial history. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nAlan V. Edmunds, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 3, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 24, 2011, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mark E. Curry\ndenied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to the Directive\n\u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s adverse clearance\ndecision is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\n\n1In support of his argument, Applicant cites to several hearing-level cases which he contends support granting\nhim a clearance.  The Board gives due consideration to these cases.  However, hearing-level cases are not legally binding\nprecedent, even if an applicant can establish close factual similarities between those cases and his.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 07-04012 at 2 (App. Bd.

He is an honorably discharged veteran of the United States\nMarine Corp.  He has a distinguished military record and employment history.  Applicant\u2019s wife is\na Russian citizen, who has been living in the United States for the last four years as a non-\nconditional permanent resident.

Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s maternal grandparents are citizens and residents of\nUkraine.  Decision at 2-3.\nApplicant\u2019s wife communicates with her parents via telephone and/or e-mail approximately\nonce a month.  Applicant does not speak Russian and his in-laws do not speak English, so their\ncommunication is limited.  Applicant and his wife typically travel to Russia to visit his parents-in-\nlaw approximately once a year, and in the past his mother-in-law has traveled to the United States\nto visit him and his wife.  Id. at 3.\nRussia has an aggressive, ongoing intelligence collection program targeting the United\nStates, focusing particularly on military technology and gas and oil industry expertise.  In recent\nyears, Russia\u2019s foreign policy objectives have grown increasingly inimical to United States interests.\nIn June 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested ten alleged Russian spies who had been\ncarrying out long-term deep cover assignments in the United States.  The following month, all ten\ndefendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government within the United\nStates and were immediately expelled.  Although Russia has made some progress in respecting\nhuman rights since the breakup of the Soviet Union, significant problems remain.  For example,\nhuman rights activists and journalists have been killed under mysterious circumstance over the\nyears, and the press has at times been brutally suppressed.  Russian law requires telephone and\ncellular companies to grant its Ministry of Internal Affairs and Federal Security Service 24-hour\nremote access to their client database.  Also, these agencies require Internet companies to provide\ndedicated lines to enable tracking of private e-mail communications.  Id.\n  \nOn appeal, Applicant seeks reversal of the Judge\u2019s adverse decision under Guideline B\narguing essentially that the security concerns presented by Applicant\u2019s in-laws are minimal and the\nevidence is sufficient to establish that those concerns have been mitigated.1  Consistent with the\nfollowing discussion, the Board affirms the decision of the Judge. \nOnce the government presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the\napplicant to establish mitigation.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of\nfact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence\noutweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s\n\nweighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that\nis arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-07635 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug.\n22, 2008).\nA review of the record indicates that the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by\nApplicant against the seriousness of the disqualifying circumstances and considered the possible\napplication of relevant conditions and factors.  He found in favor of Applicant as to several of the\nSOR factual allegations.  However, he reasonably explained why the evidence which the Applicant\npresented in mitigation was insufficient to overcome all of the government\u2019s security concerns.  The\nBoard does not review a case de novo.  The favorable record evidence cited by Applicant is not\nsufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary, capricious or contrary to law.  The Board\nconcludes that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for\nthe decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs.

A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached",

Edmunds, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concern posed by his parents-in-law, both\ncitizens and residents of Russia.\nStatement of the Case\nOn August 3, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concern under Guideline B,\nForeign Influence. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines\n(AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1,\n2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 9, 2010, admitting all the allegations,\nand requesting a hearing. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on October 7, 2010,\nJanuary 24, 2011\n\n2\nscheduling it for October 27, 2010. I held the hearing as scheduled. During the hearing, I\nreceived three Government exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3,\nsixteen Applicant exhibits marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through P, and the\ntestimony of Applicant and a character witness. Also, at the Government\u2019s request, I took\nadministrative notice of the adjudicative facts set forth in nine documents, marked as\nHearing Exhibit (HE) I through IX. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on\nNovember 4, 2010.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 30-year-old married man with no children. He is a veteran of the\nUnited States Marine Corps, where he served from 2000 through 2005. He was\nhonorably discharged.\nApplicant was a stellar Marine, earning a Good Conduct Medal in February 2003.\n(AE I at 4) Also, while in the Marines, he became certified as a novice linguist of the\nSpanish language, and later, successfully completed a \u201ccryptologic technician\ninterpretive (Spanish) course.\u201d (AE I at 7, 14) \nSince leaving the Marines, Applicant has worked for a federal law enforcement\ncontractor as a network security engineer. He has been attending college full time since\n2005 and currently needs two additional credits to earn a bachelor of science degree in\ninformation technology and business management. (Tr. 40, 41)\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s supervisor he is an \u201cextremely capable\u201d employee. (Tr.\n22) On one occasion, Applicant \u201cproactively pointed out potential security defects in a\nsystem implementation that could have seriously compromised sensitive information.\u201d\n(AE C) In 2006, Applicant received two awards for outstanding service. (AE K, L) In\nMarch 2007, he earned the Joint Civilian Service Achievement Award for outstanding\nservice to his client in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. (AE I at 1) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a 24-year old Russian citizen who has been living in the U.S.\nfor the past four years. (Tr. 31) He met her in July 2006. They got married the following\nyear. Applicant\u2019s wife was educated in Russia earning both an undergraduate and a\nmaster\u2019s degree in economics. (Tr. 53) Currently, she works for an accounting firm. (Tr.\n56)\nApplicant\u2019s wife is living in the U.S. as a non-conditional permanent resident.  (Tr.\n33) She will be eligible for U.S. citizenship later this year. (Tr. 30)\nApplicant\u2019s parent-in-laws are dual Russian/Ukrainian citizens who live in Russia.\nHis mother-in-law is an accountant. (Tr. 55) Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a lieutenant\ncolonel in the Russian Federation Army. (Tr. 33) In 2006, he retired after 20 years of\nservice, then was recalled to active duty approximately one year later. (Tr. 34, 47) He\nintends to retire again at the end of the year. Applicant\u2019s father-in-law works in a division\n\n3\nof the Russian Federation Army that is analogous to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n(Tr. 47) He is a civil engineer who designs bridges and roads. (Tr. 47)\nApplicant\u2019s wife communicates with her parents via phone and/or e-mail\napproximately once per month. (Tr. 44) Because Applicant does not speak Russian, and\nneither of his parent-in-laws speak English, their communication is limited. (Tr. 33, 47)\nApplicant and his spouse typically travel to Russia to visit his parents-in-law\napproximately once per year around the holidays. (Tr. 34) They have no immediate\nfuture plans to return to Russia. This past year, Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law travelled to the\nU.S. to celebrate the Christmas holiday with his family. Neither Applicant\u2019s wife nor her\nparents know anything about his job other than that he works with computers.  (Tr. 36,\n45) \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s maternal grandparents are citizens and residents of Ukraine.\nApplicant usually sees them when he visits his Russian in-laws. (Tr. 35) Like his parents-\nin-law, they do not speak English. (Tr. 35)\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s aunt is a Russian citizen who lives in Italy. Over the years,\nApplicant has had minimal contact with her. (Answer at 2; Tr. 36)\nBoth Applicant\u2019s father and sister are U.S. Army veterans. When his sister left the\nmilitary, she was a lieutenant. (Tr. 38)\nApplicant earns approximately $100,000 annually. (Tr. 38, AE M at 2) He owns his\nhome and has approximately $1,000 in savings. (Tr. 38-39)\nRussia has an aggressive, ongoing intelligence collection program targeting the\nU.S. (HE V at 1) Its espionage focuses on military technology and gas and oil industry\nexpertise. (Id. at 2) Over the past few years, Russia\u2019s foreign policy objectives have\ngrown increasingly inimical to U.S. interests. (HE III at 24) In June 2010, the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice arrested ten alleged Russian spies who had been carrying out\nlong-term deep cover assignments in the U.S. (HE VIII) The following month, all ten\ndefendants pleaded guilty to conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government\nwithin the U.S., and were immediately expelled. (HE IX)\nAlthough Russia has made some progress in respecting human rights since the\nbreakup of the Soviet Union, significant problems remain. For example, several human\nrights activists and journalists have been killed under mysterious circumstances over the\nyears. (HE II at 2) The press has, at times, been brutally suppressed. (Id. at 29) Russian\nlaw requires telephone and cellular companies to grant its Ministry of Internal Affairs and\nFederal Security Service 24-hour remote access to their client databases. (HE II at 16)\nAlso, these agencies require Internet companies to provide dedicated lines to enable\ntracking of private e-mail communications. (Id.) \n\n4\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines. In addition to\nbrief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied together with the factors\nlisted in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if\nthe individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin the U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 6) Moreover, \u201cadjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of\nthe foreign country in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including,\nbut not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target\nUnited States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\u201d (Id.)\nA \u201ccurrent and accurate assessment of the \u2018geopolitical situation\u2019 and the\nsecurity/intelligence profile of the [foreign] country vis-a-vis the United States is crucial in\nGuideline B cases.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 07-05686 at 4, footnote 3 (App. Bd. November 12,\n2008)) Here, the Government\u2019s allegations of a security risk generated by Applicant\u2019s\nwife\u2019s grandparents, Ukrainian citizens and residents are unsupported by any record\nevidence concerning Ukraine. I conclude Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s grandparents do not generate\n\n5\na security risk, and that Applicant\u2019s parent-in-law\u2019s dual Ukrainian citizenship does not\ngenerate a security risk. \nConversely, Russia\u2019s history of espionage against the U.S., its increasingly\ninimical stance toward U.S. strategic objectives, and its history of human rights violations\ncompel me to conclude that Applicant\u2019s spouse, aunt, and his parents-in-law generate a\nsecurity concern under AG \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign\ncountry if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement,\nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d\nAlthough Applicant\u2019s aunt is a Russian citizen, she resides in Italy. He has had\nminimal contact with her. AG \u00b6 8(c), \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so\ncasual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation,\u201d applies to this relationship.\nApplicant\u2019s spouse lives with him and has a steady job. She has non-conditional\npermanent U.S. resident immigration status and will be eligible for citizenship later this\nyear. Under these circumstances, the likelihood that Russia would seek to directly\npressure Applicant through his wife is minimal. AG \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships\nwith foreign persons . . . [is] such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government, and the interests of the U.S.,\u201d applies.\nNone of the mitigating conditions applies to Applicant\u2019s relationship to his parents-\nin-law. He contends that their relationship is mitigated by its casual and infrequent\nnature. However, there is a presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or\nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d (ISCR Case No.\n01-03120, (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002) at 4) Applicant and his in-laws cannot readily\ncommunicate because of their language barrier. However, Applicant visits them\napproximately once per year, and his wife communicates with them approximately once\nper month. Applicant has not overcome this presumption.\nApplicant is an upstanding individual with a distinguished military record and\nemployment history. He has consistently dedicated himself to personal and professional\ngrowth, successfully completing training to become a Spanish linguist while in the\nMarines, and attending college full-time while working over the past five years. Both his\nfather and a sibling have served in the U.S. military. \nConversely, not only are Applicant\u2019s parents-in-law resident citizens of Russia, his\nfather-in-law is a lieutenant colonel in the Russian Federation Army. The security\nsignificance of this fact creates a burden too high for Applicant to overcome. None of the\nmitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents-in-law.\n\n6\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI have considered these whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying\nand mitigating conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. Applicant has\nfailed to mitigate the security concern.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSOR subparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSOR subparagraphs 1.b-1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSOR subparagraphs 1.e-1.f:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6 2 to \u00b6 5 of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 54 years old and married to his current wife since February 13, 2010. He has three children from his first marriage. (Tr. 18; Exhibit 1) Applicant\u2019s wife testified he is sober, honest, and a caring individual. She has not seen him drink alcohol or relapse into alcoholism.

On April 12, 2011, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines \nF (Financial Considerations), G (Alcohol Consumption), H (Drug Involvement), J \n(Criminal Conduct), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 18, 2011. He answered the \nSOR in writing on May 23, 2011, and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. DOHA received the request on May 24, 2011. Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed on August 19, 2011, and I received the case assignment on \nAugust 29, 2011. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 27, 2011, and I \n04/09/2012\n\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on November 18, 2011. The Government offered \nExhibits 1 through 55, which were admitted without objection pursuant to a joint \nstipulation. Applicant testified and submitted Exhibits A through HH without objection \nbased on a joint stipulation of counsel. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non November 29, 2011. Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 5.a. by changing the words \n\u201cparagraph 3.i\u201d to \u201cparagraph 3.j.\u201d Applicant had no objection to the new reference and I \ngranted the motion. (Tr. 63) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.c, and 1.e and 1.f. He denied 1.d of the SOR, with explanations. He admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6 2 to \u00b6 5 of the SOR. He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and married to his current wife since February 13, 2010. \nHe has three children from his first marriage.

She testified Applicant paid his financial debts. \nApplicant attends Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) several times a month. (Tr. 13-17) \n \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. Army security clearance was revoked in November 1998 after a \npersonal appearance hearing before an administrative judge. The revocation decision \nwas based on Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol dependence, use of illegal drugs, and \ndeliberate falsification of relevant facts pertaining to the former two security concerns \n(Subparagraph 2.u). Four of the same issues are present in the current hearing case: \nincluding alcohol considerations (Guideline G, \u00b6 2); use of illegal drugs (Guideline H, \u00b6 \n3); criminal activity (Guideline J, \u00b6 4); and failure to disclose information to government \ninvestigators regarding the use of marijuana and cocaine while holding a security \nclearance (Guideline E, \u00b6 5). Applicant testified at the March 2, 1998, personal \nappearance that he had been sober for almost six years, from 1992 to 1998. (Tr. 36; \nExhibits 1-11)  \n \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005 (Subparagraph 1.a). He was \ndischarged in January 2006. The bankruptcy was caused by financial difficulties arising \nfrom his divorce from his first wife in July 2001, his several periods of unemployment, \n\nand his alcoholism. One unemployment period occurred when the lack of work forced \nhis employer to lay off Applicant in April 2002. Four terminations were caused by \nApplicant\u2019s alcoholism and his consumption of alcohol before work, during lunch time, \narriving late for work for an appointment, and spending time away from work seeking \ntreatment for alcohol addiction (Subparagraphs 2.q to 2.t) (October 2000 to April 2001; \nDecember 2003 to October 2004; January 2005 to September 2006; and September \n2007 to December 2007). (Tr. 30-35; Exhibits 1, 14-16, 22-25, I, U, GG, HH) \n \nApplicant owed a hospital $150 (Subparagraph 1.b). This debt is paid and \nresolved. (Tr. 23; Exhibits 14-16, 22-25, FF; Answer) \n \nApplicant owed $2,928 on a medical account (Subparagraph 1.c). This debt is \nbeing paid at the rate of $100 monthly. Applicant currently owes about $2,200. This debt \nis being resolved. (Tr. 24; Exhibits 14-16, 22-25, FF; Answer) \n \nApplicant owed a debt to a bank in the amount of $19,928 (Subparagraph 1.d). \nThis debt was discharged in the 2006 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. This debt is resolved. \n(Exhibits 14-16, 22-25, GG; Answer) \n \nApplicant\u2019s income from his employer was garnished for child support payments \nin the amount of $613.59 bi-monthly starting in January 2008. The state alleged \nApplicant owed more than $52,000 in unpaid child support. This action was based on \nincorrect information and Applicant was able to terminate the garnishment in October \n2008. Applicant\u2019s former wife submitted a statement that Applicant is current with his \nchild support and no balance is owed. This allegation (Subparagraph 1.e) is based on \nerroneous information and is resolved. (Tr. 22, 39; Exhibits 14-16, 22-25, Z; Answer and \nattachments F and G) \n \nApplicant owed a delinquent debt to a Department of Defense agency on a loan \nfor advanced sick leave payments in the amount of $5,600.41 (Subparagraph 1.f). \nApplicant contends this debt was paid, but the exhibits show the debt was included in \nthe 2006 Chapter 7 bankruptcy and was discharged. The credit reports exhibits show \nthe debt was discharged in bankruptcy. Therefore, this debt is resolved through the \nbankruptcy process. (Tr. 20; Exhibits 14-16, 22-25, I, GG) \n \nApplicant does not have any credit cards in his name at the present time. His \nmonthly debts are paid on time. He earns a six-figure income. He started work for his \npresent employer in December 2007. (Tr. 28, 35; Exhibits Y, AA-FF) \n \nApplicant began consuming alcohol at the age of 13 and continued until 2008, \nexcept for the 1992 to 1998 period. His drinking was excessive and included binge \ndrinking. Applicant claims he can now resist the compulsion to drink. He attends \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) but does not have a sponsor. Applicant represents he \ncompleted the 12-Step AA program. He is a sponsor for another AA member. Applicant \nadmits he is an alcoholic. He has had numerous relapses from sobriety after his \n\nrehabilitation programs. (See the chart he provided as part of Exhibit 13.) (Tr. 21, 36-38; \nExhibits 12-16, U, W) \n \nApplicant has received the diagnoses of alcohol and polysubstance abuse and \ndependence several times from 1985 to 2009 while at treatment facilities. Psychiatrists \nin 1996 also diagnosed Applicant as having a \u201cnarcissistic personality disorder.\u201d \nApplicant was admitted to a hospital on March 18, 2005, after passing out in public. His \nBAC was .44%. He was placed on a detoxification protocol. In April 2008 Applicant was \nadmitted to a hospital for alcohol poisoning after consuming two \u201cfifths of alcohol\u201d during \na two day period. These events resulted in 14 treatment program admissions in that 24 \nyear time period (Subparagraphs 2.b to 2.f). (Exhibits 2-8, 12-14, 18-21, 30-36, 39, 42-\n45, 48-55) \n \nApplicant has nine alcohol-related driving arrests between 1976 and 2000:  \n \n1. Applicant was arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol (DWI) in \nMarch 1976 and received a fine and probation (Subparagraph 2.g);  \n \n2. In November 1982 he was arrested for operating a vehicle under the influence \nof intoxicating liquor (DUI). Applicant was fined, placed on probation, and his driving \nprivileges revoked (Subparagraph 2.h);  \n \n3. He was arrested in December 1984 for impaired driving. Applicant received a \nfine, probation, and a restricted driver\u2019s license. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was \n.24% (Subparagraph 2.i);  \n \n4. In March 1985 Applicant was again arrested for DUI, found guilty and fined, \nplaced on probation, and given jail time (Subparagraph 2.j);  \n \n5. In May 1992 he was arrested for traveling in a motor vehicle with an open \ncontainer of alcohol and marijuana. No disposition is noted (Subparagraphs 2.k and \n3.c);  \n \n6. Applicant was fined in May 1992 in another state after being arrested for DWI \nand possession of marijuana (Subparagraphs 2.l and 3.b);  \n \n7. He was arrested on August 6, 1992 for DUI. His BAC was .31% and .30%. \nApplicant was fined and placed on 18 months\u2019 probation (Subparagraph 2.m); \n \n 8. On August 15, 1992, Applicant was again arrested for DUI. He was fined, \nplaced on two years\u2019 probation, received a suspended jail sentence of 60 days, ordered \nto outpatient therapy, and ordered to take Antabuse to prevent his alcohol consumption \n(Subparagraph 2.n); \n \n\n9. Applicant violated probation in about March 1993 by not taking Antabuse \nmedicine and drinking alcohol. He was ordered by the court after his August 15, 1992, \narrest not to consume alcohol (Subparagraph 2.o); \n \n10. Applicant was arrested in March 2000 for DUI. He drove his car into a house \nafter driving through a stop sign, hitting the curb, striking a tree and a utility pole support \nline. His BAC was .27%. He was fined, sentenced to 45 days in jail, and placed on two \nyears\u2019 probation (Subparagraph 2.p). (Tr. 20, 36; Exhibits 12, 14, 21, 26-30, 37-41, 46, \n47) \n \nApplicant lost four jobs caused by Applicant\u2019s alcoholism and his consumption of \nalcohol before work, during lunch time, arriving late for work for an appointment, and \nspending time away from work seeking treatment for alcohol addiction (Subparagraphs \n2.q to 2.t). The first termination occurred in September 2000, the second in November \n2003, the third firing occurred in November 2004, and the fourth job loss in August \n2007. (Tr. 30-34; Exhibits 1, 12-21, 48-55) \n \nApplicant began using marijuana in 1973 and used it frequently from 1985 to \n1992 while holding a security clearance (Subparagraph 3.a). (Exhibits 1, 3, 8, 14, 26-54; \nAnswer) \n \nApplicant started using cocaine in the late 1970s and continued to use it from \n1985 to 1989 while holding a security clearance (Subparagraph 3.d) (Exhibits 1-14, 26-\n54; Answer) \n \nApplicant self-prescribed and consumed his mother\u2019s anxiety medication (Ativan) \nfor two weeks in 2006 (Subparagraph 2.e). Applicant did this after his mother died on \nFebruary 1, 2006. He used up to three pills daily to help him with his grief. Applicant \nused his mother\u2019s pills for 15 days. (Exhibits 1-19, U; Answer) \n \nApplicant was diagnosed as dependent on and an abuser of marijuana on two \noccasions. Those evaluations occurred on August 10, 1992 and April 27, 2005 \n(Subparagraph 3.f). (Exhibits 1-8, 31-36, 42-45, 48-54; Answer)    \n \nApplicant was diagnosed as dependent on and an abuser of cocaine by a duly \nqualified medical professional or licensed clinical social worker on or about April 27, \n2002 (Subparagraph 3.g). (Exhibits 1-8, 12-19, 48-54; Answer) \n \n  Applicant was diagnosed as addicted to oxycontin by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional or licensed clinical social worker on or about April 8, 2002. He purchased \noxycontin without a prescription on an Internet website and used it from March to April \n2002 (Subparagraphs 3.h and 3.i). Applicant had a prescription for oxycontin in October \n2011, after his earlier diagnoses of substance abuse. He also had prescriptions for \nmorphine, lorazepam, and diazepam. These medications are for pain and anti-anxiety \nrelief. (Exhibits 17, 18, 48-54, N-R; Answer) \n \n\nApplicant used marijuana in September 2006 (Subparagraph 3.j) (Exhibits 1, 12-\n21; Answer) \n \nApplicant\u2019s driving under the influence of alcohol and the presence of marijuana \nin the vehicle between 1976 to 2000, and his possession and use of marijuana and \ncocaine from 1973 to 2006, while holding a government security clearance \n(Subparagraphs 2.g to 2.p, 3.a to 3.i), are actions in violation of state and federal \ncriminal laws (Paragraph 4). (Exhibits 1-21, 26-55; Answer) \n \nApplicant failed to admit to government investigators in July 2008 that he used \nmarijuana as recently as September 2006 (Subparagraph 5.a). Applicant\u2019s U.S. Army \nsecurity clearance was revoked in 1997 for personal conduct, criminal conduct, \npersonality disorders including mental and emotional issues, and alcohol consumption. \n(Subparagraphs 2.u and 5.b). He used marijuana starting in 1973 and many times from \n1985 to 1992 while holding a secret clearance (Subparagraphs 3.a, 3.d, and 5.b). \nApplicant also used cocaine from the late 1970s and during 1985 to 1989 while holding \na security clearance (Subparagraph 3.d and 5.b). (Exhibits 1-14, 26-54; Answer) \n \nApplicant submitted his 2009-2011 performance evaluations from his current \nemployer where he works as a systems engineer. They show his ratings were that he \nfrequently exceeds expectations resulting in exemplary performance, or far exceeds \nexpectations resulting in exceptional performance. (Exhibits F-H)  \n \nApplicant submitted 12 letters of recommendation. These persons comment \nfavorably on Applicant\u2019s work ethic and productivity. They report his judgment is clear \nand sound. These writers consider Applicant honest and a man of integrity. One \nsupervisor reports Applicant has performed in an outstanding manner in the tasks \nassigned to him. Two reference letters were written by persons who knew Applicant as \na youth in their neighborhoods who knew and associated their children while growing up \nthere. Applicant\u2019s present wife submitted a character letter. Applicant also submitted two \nbiographical letters detailing his personal history to the current time. (Exhibits A-E, J-M, \nT, U)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process (AG \u00b6 2(a)). The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \n\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG  18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n\nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 19 contains nine disqualifying conditions that could raise \nsecurity concerns.  Two conditions are applicable to the facts found in this case: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant owes more than $29,019.59 in delinquent debt that accumulated from \n2001 to the present time and remained unpaid as of the date of the SOR.  Applicant had \nfive delinquent debts listed in the SOR. Applicant also filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2005 and was discharged in 2006.  \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Three conditions may be applicable:   \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under thecircumstances; \nand \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n  \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties occurred several years ago when he was \nundergoing a divorce in 2001 and subsequently experienced five periods of \nunemployment. Four of these periods were caused by Applicant\u2019s alcohol addiction. He \nhas not consumed alcohol since 2008, so that factor, which in the past resulted in \nseveral episodes of unemployment, is diminished at present. The financial behavior was \nseveral years ago and occurred under a combination of factors not likely to occur again. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances and took appropriate and legal \naction to resolve his delinquent debts, including the bankruptcy filing. AG \u00b6 20 (a) and \n(b) apply.   \n \nApplicant paid his delinquent debts. The child support was an erroneous \ncollection effort by his home state. The matter was resolved. The bankruptcy occurred \nfive years ago and is not a factor in Applicant\u2019s current financial status. He is paying two \naccounts on an installment payment plan. The $19,928 debt owed to a bank was \ndischarged in bankruptcy in 2006, as was the sick leave loan from a government \nagency. AG \u00b6 20 (d) applies because of Applicant\u2019s good-faith efforts to repay his \ndelinquent debts, albeit through bankruptcy for his debts incurred before 2006.  \n\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \n \n Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job, regardless of \nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol \ndependent; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol \ndependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed \nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol \ntreatment program; \n \n(f) relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and completion \nof an alcohol rehabilitation program; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence. \n \nAll the disqualifying conditions apply. Applicant has nine alcohol-related driving \narrests between 1976 and 2000, including an accident in which he drove into a house \nafter hitting a tree when he failed to halt at a stop sign. His BAC in these incidents \nranged from .27% to .44%. Applicant was terminated four times from employment \nbecause he drank alcohol at work or before coming to work. He failed to comply with a \ncourt order to use Anabuse and continued to consume alcohol. His drinking was \nexcessive and habitual. He attended several rehabilitation programs but resumed \n\ndrinking after or during his attendance. He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent by the \nprofessional members of the rehabilitation programs, including physicians and licensed \nclinical social workers.  Applicant admits he is an alcoholic. His longest period of self-\ndescribed sobriety was from 1992 to 1998 when he had his last security clearance \nappeal hearing. Subsequently, he relapsed. Now he claims to be abstinent since 2008. \nApplicant\u2019s multitudinous relapses from alcohol abstinence since 1976 make his current \nclaim unpersuasive.    \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns \nunder this guideline: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, \nand is making satisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nAG \u00b6 23 (b) has partial application because Applicant admits his alcoholism. He \nparticipates in AA but does not have a sponsor. He is a sponsor for another member \naccording to the exhibit submitted at the hearing. Applicant denies he has the \ncompulsion to drink alcohol. However, the last evaluation or rehabilitation program \ndocumentation Applicant submitted was in 2009, the last of his 14 participations in such \nprograms. His asserted pattern of abstinence is not established by any objective \nprofessional evaluation or report.  \n \n \n \n \n  \n\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to illegal drugs: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens), and \n \n(2) inhalants and other similar substances; \n \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes eight conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Five conditions apply in this case: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana from 1973 to 1992, and as late as 2006. He used \ncocaine in the late 1970\u2019s and from 1985 to 1989. Applicant consumed his mother\u2019s \nanti-anxiety medication Ativan for two weeks in 2006. AG \u00b6 25 (a) applies. \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine while holding a security clearance from \n1985 to 1989. AG \u00b6 25 (g) applies. \n \n\n \nApplicant possessed marijuana and cocaine, which are illegal substances. He \npurchased the anti-anxiety drug oxycontin from an internet website from March to April \n2002 without a valid prescription. AG \u00b6 25 (c) applies.  \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed as marijuana dependent/abuse on August 10, 1992, \nand April 27, 2005, by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social \nworker. He was also diagnosed as cocaine dependent/abuse on April 27, 2005. \nApplicant was diagnosed as oxycontin dependent by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional on April 8, 2002. AG \u00b6 25 (d) and (e) apply.    \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of   \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n  \n \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. Applicant history of illegal drug use \nextends over two decades. The use of illegal drugs cast serious doubt on Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, trustworthiness, and current reliability, regardless of the number of character \nstatements submitted. AG \u00b6 26 (a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant did not discuss his intent not to use illegal drugs in the future or that he \nwas currently abstinent because of any interior motivation or exterior force. His illegal \nuse of prescription anti-anxiety medications was not after a medically diagnosed illness. \nAG \u00b6 26 (b) and (c) do not apply.  \n \n\n \nApplicant\u2019s repeated use of illegal drugs shows an inability to abstain from them. \nHe did not submit a current evaluation by a duly licensed medical professional or a \nlicensed clinical social worker from a recognized rehabilitation program, confirming his \nassertions that he is sober and abstinent, and has a good prognosis to remain that way. \nHis latest information is five years or more old. AG \u00b6 26 (d) does not apply. \n  \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and   \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three conditions apply in this case: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s nine alcohol and marijuana-related driving arrests are multiple crimes. \nHis possession of marijuana and cocaine are crimes under state and federal laws. AG \u00b6 \n31 (a) and (c) apply.  \n \n \nApplicant violated his probation in March 1993 by not taking the Antabuse \nordered by the court after his driving arrest. He also violated the same court order by \nconsuming alcohol after being ordered not to do so. AG \u00b6 31 (e) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns. One \ncondition may apply: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \nInsufficient time has passed since the commission of these offenses, so AG \u00b6 32 \n(a) does not apply except very minimally. His last arrest was in 2006. The time since \nthen is not sufficient because of his long criminal history prior to that arrest.  \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant was coerced into committing any of the alleged \nactions. Therefore, AG \u00b6 32 (b) does not apply. \n \nApplicant admitted his guilt on all the crimes set forth in the SOR. AG \u00b6 32 (c) \ndoes not apply.  \n \nApplicant has a good employment record, based on his evaluations and \nsupervisor\u2019s statements.  He has not committed any other crimes since 2006. AG \u00b6 (d) \napplies partially on these two factors.  \n  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes six conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three conditions may apply: \n \n\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another \ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is \nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a \nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence \nservice or other group. \n \n  \nApplicant failed to admit to government investigators that he used marijuana as \nlate as September 2006 during the course of their background interview in July 2008. \nAG \u00b6 16 (b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant has a three decade history of alcohol, drug, and criminal misconduct. \nEach series of incidents under these headings is sufficient to disqualify Applicant \nbecause they demonstrate his questionable judgment, lack of trustworthiness, \nunreliability, and unwillingness to comply with statutes, rules, regulations, and court \norders. All actions bring into question his commitment to safeguarding classified \ninformation. AG \u00b6 16 (c) applies. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long history of misconduct makes him vulnerable to exploitation, \nduress, coercion, or manipulation that affects his personal, professional, or community \nstanding. Applicant was fired four times from responsible jobs for his alcohol use during \nor before working hours. He has numerous driving violations caused by alcohol \nconsumption. Applicant obtained and used illegal drugs and anti-anxiety medications. \nHe used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance in the 1980s. His Army \nclearance was revoked in 1997 based on several of the same security concerns as \nappear in the current SOR. At the time of his 1997 hearing he also claimed, as he does \nnow, a multi-year term of alcohol abstinence, after which he resumed his drinking \npattern and was arrested in 2000 for DUI. These are serious violations of community \nand professional standards. AG \u00b6 16 (e) applies. \n \n \n\nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns. None of \nthe conditions apply: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully. \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and, \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n \n \nApplicant did not submit any evidence to support the application of any of the \nmitigating conditions. Applicant did not seek immediately to correct any incorrect \ninformation given government investigators. He did not take positive steps to reduce his \nvulnerability to coercion and duress. The omission of drug information, in an interview \nwith a government investigator is a serious offense. the use of illegal drugs is a serious \nlaw violation. The information is well-substantiated and verified by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the \u201cwhole-person concept,\u201d the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was a mature adult and \nprofessional when he committed the various acts alleged in the SOR. He has a serious \nand recurring problem with alcohol and drugs. He exercised extremely poor judgment \nusing illegal drugs while holding his previous security clearance. He has nine alcohol-\nrelated driving arrests. He was fired four times from jobs because of his alcohol use. \nApplicant illegally obtained a medication using the Internet. He has been diagnosed as \nalcohol and drug dependent several times in the past 20 years, but continued to drink \nand use illegal drugs. There is no rehabilitation or changed behavior pattern \nindependently verified by current professional evaluations. Applicant may be a good \nemployee now, but that does not qualify him for a security clearance and access to \nclassified documents. His past history of substance abuse and relapses cause serious \ndoubt about his present declaration of abstinence and lack of compulsion to drink \nalcohol to excess, or use illegal substances.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his Financial \nConsiderations. He did not mitigate the security concerns under Alcohol Consumption, \nDrug Involvement, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct. I conclude the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept\u201d against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n\nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.u:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a to 3.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 5, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 5.a and 5.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "FINDINGS OF FACT The Applicant is 23 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Engineering. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement). The Government alleges that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs. The Applicant attended college from August 2004 through May 2008. He used marijuana about nine times between August 2004 and March 2008. He explained that he used marijuana at parties, mostly on weekends with friends from school. Since he was very studious and determined to get good grades, he would only use it when he had no important commitments. Marijuana made him feel lazy. The Applicant also used Adderal, a prescription drug, approximately nine times between August 2005 and January 2008. He explained that he used it to help him stay awake so that he could study longer. He stated that in the college environment, it was customary for some college students to use the drug that would prolong their studying time without them getting tired. (Tr. pp. 22 and 30).

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Ronald P. Ackerman, Attorney At Law\nSeptember 22, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on June 24, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On February 28, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing\nthe security concerns under Guideline H for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 7, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on July 2, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on July 6, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for August 12, 2009.  The Government offered three exhibits,\nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 and 3, which were received without objection.\n\n2\nApplicant offered seven exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through G.  He also\ntestified on his own behalf.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on August\n20, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 23 years old and has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Engineering.  He is\nemployed by a defense contractor as an Engineer, and is applying for a security\nclearance in connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nThe Applicant attended college from August 2004 through May 2008.  He used\nmarijuana about nine times between August 2004 and March 2008.  He explained that\nhe used marijuana at parties, mostly on weekends with friends from school.  Since he\nwas very studious and determined to get good grades, he would only use it when he\nhad no important commitments.  Marijuana made him feel lazy. \nThe Applicant also used Adderal, a prescription drug, approximately nine times\nbetween August 2005 and January 2008.  He explained that he used it to help him stay\nawake so that he could study longer.  He stated that in the college environment, it was\ncustomary for some college students to use the drug that would prolong their studying\ntime without them getting tired.  (Tr. pp. 22 and 30).    \nAfter graduating from college, the Applicant stopped using illegal substances of\nany kind and he has no intentions of ever using any illegal drug again.  He has signed a\nletter of intent indicating that he understands that any future use of any controlled\nsubstance without a lawful prescription would result in the immediate and automatic\nrevocation of any security clearance he might hold.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F).  He\nexplained that he applied for an internship position with a defense contractor and was\noffered a summer job in 2007.  Following his successful internship, he was offered a\npermanent position located out of state, and began his employment in July 2008.  He\nwas completely candid in response to all of the questions on his security clearance\napplication, and disclosed his illegal drug use.  The Applicant understands that the DoD\nprohibits the use of any illegal drug, and that his company has a zero tolerance policy. \nThe Applicant now has a new set of friends, who are professionals and not drug\nusers.  He lives with another engineer from his company, who does not use drugs.  He\nnow has many responsibilities, including paying his bills and supporting himself.  He\nlives an active lifestyle and is extremely career minded.  He is going back to school for\nhis Masters in Aerospace Engineering.  The Applicant states that if he encounters\nanyone in the future who uses drugs in his presence, he will leave the area. \nLetters of recommendation from the Applicant\u2019s manager, project supervisor,\ncoworker, girlfriend, roommate, and friends attest to his intelligence, honesty, and\n\n3\ntrustworthy nature.  He is considered to be a hardworking, conscientious person with\nstrong moral values.  Most of them are aware that the Applicant used Marijuana and\nAdderal while in college.  They have observed the Applicant in the work place, at school\nand in social environments and have never seen him use any illegal drugs or\nmedications since working for the defense contractor.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, B, C, D,\nand E).  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25. (a) any drug abuse;\n25.(c) Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia;\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n26.  (b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:\n26. (b)(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n26. (b)(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;\n26. (b)(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances.\n\n4\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges.\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d             \n                                   \nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\n\n5\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant was engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.\nBecause of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus\nor connection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H of the SOR.  I have considered all of the\nevidence presented in this case, including the letters of recommendation.  The Applicant\nused Marijuana and Adderal on an infrequent basis while in college.  This was a stupid\nand childish thing to do.  Although he is young, since graduating from college, he has\njoined the work force, taken on life\u2019s responsibilities, and matured a great deal.  He has\ndrastically changed his environment from a college lifestyle to a professional work\nenvironment where there is no room for illegal drug use.  He has a better understanding\nof the seriousness and effects of illegal drugs and their effect on his personal life and\nhis career.  He has not used any illegal drug for over a year, and has no intention of\never using any illegal drug again.  He is ashamed and remorseful for his misconduct in\nthe past.  He has increased his self-confidence and no longer needs to hang around\nwith losers in society.  He has signed a statement of intent indicating that he will not use\nillegal drugs in the future and if he does, his security clearance will be immediately\nrevoked.  This further demonstrates his commitment to a drug free lifestyle.\nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, and 25.(c) Illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; apply.\nMitigating Conditions 26.(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future,\nsuch as: 26.(b).(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; 26.(b).(3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence, and 26(b)(4) a signed statement of intent with\nautomatic revocation of clearance for any violation applies.  Accordingly, I find for the\nApplicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 23 years old, educated,\nintelligent, successful, and a fairly new employee of the defense industry. He\nunderstands the responsibilities of an individual, who has the privilege of holding a\nsecurity clearance.  He has cleaned up his act, and realizes the seriousness of illegal\ndrug use and how negatively it can effect his life.  He no longer uses illegal drugs, and\n\n6\nis looking forward to a successful career and a good and wholesome life.   It appears\nthat this aberration or defect in judgment was an isolated one.  The likelihood of his\nmisconduct in the past being repeated is nil.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth above, when viewed under all of the guidelines as a\nwhole, support a whole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness,\nreliability, a willingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may  properly safeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and that he meets the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information at this time.  Accordingly, I\nfind for the Applicant under Guideline H (Drug Involvement).\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has overcome the Government's\ncase opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the evidence supports\na finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary allegations expressed in\nParagraph 1.                                                                                                                      \n  \n  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",
