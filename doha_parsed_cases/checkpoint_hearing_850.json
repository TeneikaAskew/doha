Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nHistory of Case \nOn November 21, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons \nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (SEAD) 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 27, 2018, and requested a \nhearing. The case was assigned to me on May 2, 2019, and was scheduled for hearing \non August 22, 2019. A hearing was convened as scheduled, for the purpose of \nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant, \ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At hearing, the Government's \ncase consisted of three exhibits; Applicant relied on one witness (herself) and 17 \nexhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 4, 2019. \nBesides its three exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of \ndetailed facts taken from nine U.S. Government official publications. Administrative or \nofficial notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See \nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007). Administrative notice is appropriate \nfor noticing facts or government reports that are well known. See Stein, Administrative \nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006). For good cause shown, administrative notice was \ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports containing the identified \nfacts in Department Counsel\u2019s Request for Administration Notice regarding the Republic \nof Bangladesh (Bangladesh) that address the geopolitical situation in Bangladesh. \nAdministrative Notice was extended to the documents themselves, consistent with the \nprovisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evid. This notice did not foreclose Applicant from \nchallenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the reports \naddressing Bangladesh\u2019s current state. Department Counsel\u2019s Administrative Notice \nRequest was received as HE 1. \nIn addition to the source documents covered by Department Counsel\u2019s \nAdministrative Notice Request, I took official notice of Background Note: Bangladesh, \nU.S. Department of State (December 2007). This document was received as HE 2. \nProcedural Rulings \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested to open the record to take \nadditional testimony and supplement the record with additional documentation. For good \ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven days to supplement the record, but her \nrequest to reopen the record to take additional testimony was denied. Within the time \npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with additional documents that were \nmarked and admitted without objection as Appellant\u2019s  exhibits (AEs)  R-II. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged to have (a) a father-in-law who is a citizen \nand resident of Bangladesh, who formerly served as a high-ranking official in the \ngovernment of Bangladesh, and who since 2006, provided Applicant and her husband \nwith approximately $80,000 of financial support; (b) a step-son who is a citizen and \nresident of Bangladesh; (c) a step-daughter who is a citizen of Bangladesh who currently \nresides in Canada to attend a university; (d) a sister who is a citizen of Australia currently \nresiding in Bangladesh; (e) an aunt who is a citizen and resident of Bangladesh; (f) five \nuncles who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh; (g) a grandmother who is a citizen \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand resident of Bangladesh; and (h) cousins who are citizens and residents of \nBangladesh. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant, admitted each of the allegations with \nexplanations.

See \nBackground Note: Bangladesh at 1, U.S. Department of State (August 2008) It is \nbordered on three sides by India and shares a small border with Burma. It has a \npopulation of approximately 160 million and a land area of 55,813 square miles, which \napproximates the size of the state of Wisconsin. (Id.) Bangladesh has a literacy rate of \nover 60% and about 98% of the population are ethnic Bengali and speak Banla. Non-\nUrdu-speaking non-Bengalis of Indian origin, and various tribal groups comprise the \nremaining 10.5 % of the population. (Id.) \nHistorical background \nOriginally part of British India, Bangladesh became known initially as East Bengal \nfollowing the partition of British India along religious lines in 1947. (Id., at 2) The \npredominantly Muslim eastern half of the region (comprised of Bangladeshis) was \ndesignated East Pakistan (or East ); while the predominately Hindo western part became \nthe Indian state of West Bengal. (Id.) Frictions developed soon after the partition between \nEast and West Pakistan. East Pakistanis felt exploited by the West Pakistan-dominated \ncentral government. Linguistic, cultural, and ethnic differences contributed to the \nestrangement of East from West Pakistan. Following failed political talks in 1971. \nPakistani president Yahya Khan postponed indefinitely the pending national assembly \nsession, precipitating massive civil disobedience in East Pakistan. \nThe crisis in East Pakistan created new strains in Pakistan\u2019s relations with India \nthat produced warring relations in 1965 between the two countries, mainly in the west. \n(Id.) The new tensions prompted India to intervene on the side of the Bangladeshis in \nNovember 1971, and in December 1971 Pakistani forces surrendered, paving the way for \nthe birth of a new Bengal country. In April 1971, Bangladesh became an independent \ncountry, recognized by the United States, and formed as a parliamentary democracy \nunder a 1972 constitution.

Some elements within Bangladesh groups have also associated \nthemselves with transnational terrorist groups. (Id.) \nIn a November 2015 issue of Dabiq, ISIS formally announced its foothold in \nBangladesh with magazine features illustrating Bangladesh as a projected strategic \noperations base for establishing a caliphate facilitating attacks inside India. (Id.) India was \nconsidered to be a symbolic and important ISIS target. \nSince 2015, ISIS-affiliated terrorists have conducted over 30 attacks targeting \nforeigners, religious minorities, and local police/security interests. See Country \nInformation: Bangladesh International Travel Information, U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of \nConsular Affairs (Oct. 2018) ISIS claimed responsibility for 18 attacks in Bangladesh in \n2016, with the most significant being the attack on July 1, 2016 on the Holy Artisan \nBakery, an upscale restaurant in the diplomatic enclave frequented by the expatriate \ncommunity. (Id.) The five Bangladeshi attackers involved in this incident killed 20 \nhostages (mostly foreigners) and two police officers using guns. Reportedly, only those \nhostages who could demonstrate that they were Muslim by reciting verses from the Koran \nwere spared. See Country Reports on Terrorism 2016: South and Central Asia: \nBangladesh, U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of Counter-terrorism and Countering Violent \nExtremism (July 2017) \nIn March 2017, ISIS claimed responsibility for at least three bombings in multiple \nlocations in Bangladesh, including suicide attacks that targeted security forces near \nDhaka\u2019s Hazrat Shahjalal Int\u2019l Airport. The third bombing occurred during a police raid \nagainst suspected terrorists, killing seven onlookers and injuring 40. See Crime & Safety \nReport, supra. Because of the ongoing attacks and threats by terrorist groups operating in \nBangladesh, the State Department issued a travel warning in July 2018, cautioning U.S. \ncitizens to reconsider travel to Dhaka and Southeast Bangladesh.

In his statement for \nthe record, the DNI (Daniel Coats) cautioned that the crisis resulting from the exodus of \nmore than 600,000 Rohingyas from Burma to Bangladesh will threaten Burma\u2019s fledgling \ndemocracy, increase the risk of violent extremism, and provide openings for Beijing to \nexpand its influence in the region. See Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. \nIntelligence Community (Statement of Daniel R. Coats DNI) (March 2018) \nHuman Rights assessment \nBangladesh\u2019s legal system has its roots in common law, and its principal source of \nlaws are reposed in Bangladesh\u2019s Parliament. Despite the reserved  protections of human \nrights in the country\u2019s constitution, government and security forces have been known to \ndisregard these protections and have been accused of human rights abuses. See \nBangladesh 2017 Human Rights Report, U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of Human Rights, \nDemocracy, and Labor (April 2018). \nThe most significant human rights abuses cited in the report included: extrajudicial \nkillings, torture, arbitrary or unlawful detentions, and forced disappearances by \ngovernment security forces; restrictions on civil liberties (including freedom of speech, \npress, and the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs); a lack of freedom to \nparticipate in the political process; corruption; violence and discrimination based on \ngender, religious affiliation, caste, tribe, including indigenous persons, and sexual \norientation and gender identity; trafficking in persons; and restrictions on worker\u2019s rights \nand the worst forms of child labor. See Bangladesh 2017 Human Rights Report, supra. \nUnited States-Bangladesh relations \nU.S. relations with Bangladesh continue to be positive and strong. See U.S. \nRelations with Bangladesh, U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of South and Central Asia Affairs \n(August 2018). Both countries cooperate closely on security issues, ranging from counter-\nterror- ism to peacekeeping. (Id.) U.S. ties to Bangladesh extend beyond government-to\u00ad\ngovernment relations to people-to-people and commercial relationships. The United \nStates has invested billions of dollars in Bangladesh, and Bangladesh is the largest \nrecipient of U.S. assistance in Asia outside of Afghanistan and Pakistan. (Id.) \nToday, the United States is committed to providing assistance to help the country \ngrow more food, build more roads, and train more skilled teachers, health care providers, \nand soldiers. See U.S. Relations with Bangladesh, supra. U.S. long-term goals for \nBangladesh are designed to reduce poverty, enhance food security, improve health and \neducation, and mitigate the impact of climate change and natural disasters, counter \nviolent extremism, and achieve better governance to promote equitable and sustainable \ngrowth. (Id.) Noteworthy, too, Bangladesh and the United States belong to a number of \nthe same international organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional \nForum, International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.

In 2017, Bangladesh exported $5.7 billion worth of products, \nprimarily apparel and textiles, which makes the United States the single largest market for \nBangladeshi goods in the world. See U.S. Relations with Bangladesh, supra. The United \nStates is also currently the largest source of direct foreign investment in Bangladesh. \nChevron is reported to be the single largest foreign investor in the country, producing \nclose to 55 per cent of Bangladesh\u2019s domestic natural gas. (Id.) To promote sustaining \ntrade relations, the two countries conduct annual talks under a Trade and Investment \nCooperation Framework Agreement (TICFA) that was concluded in 2013. (Id.) \nPolicies \nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by \nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases. \nThese \nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and \nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued or denied. \nThe Guidelines do not require the administrative judge to assess these factors \nexclusively in arriving at a decision. In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, \nadministrative judges must take into account the pertinent considerations for assessing \nextenuation and mitigation set forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of \nthe Directive, which are intended to assist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and \nimpartial common sense decision. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication policy \nfactors are pertinent herein: \nForeign Influence \nThe Concern: Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited \nto, business, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern \nif they result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of \nforeign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nSee \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 6. \n10 \n\n      Burden of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue \nApplicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding that \nto do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive requires \nadministrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence accumulated in \nthe record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a security clearance \ndepends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that evidence. As with all \nadversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences which have a \nreasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. Conversely, the Judge cannot \ndraw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: It must prove any controverted fact[s] \nalleged in the Statement of Reasons, and it must demonstrate that the facts proven have a \nmaterial bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a security clearance.  The \nrequired showing of material bearing, however, does not require the Government to \naffirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or abused classified \ninformation before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, consideration must \ntake account of cognizable risks that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nsafeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or \nmitigation of the Government's case. \nAnalysis \nApplicant was born in Bangladesh to parents of Bangladeshi descent and traces her \nheritage through her parents\u2019 ancestral links to Bangladesh. She  immigrated to the United \nStates in 1991 to reside with her former husband and son (soon to be born) and later \npursued higher education credits. \nApplicant earned associates, bachelors, and master degrees with honors in the \nUnited States in information technology with a concentration in cyber security in her \nmasters program. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2001, retains no Bangladesh \ncitizenship or passport and is employed as a cyber security engineer for a U.S. defense \ncontractor. \nSecurity issues of concern to the Government focus on the citizenship and \nresidence status of her immediate family members who reside in Bangladesh. (viz., a \nsister, grandmother, and two stepchildren) and extended family members (viz,. her \nstepfather (a former high ranking Bangladesh official), stepchildren, aunt, and several \nuncles and cousins) who reside in Bangladesh, a country known for its terrorist attacks \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand poor human rights record, albeit a county that enjoys a close and stable state-to-state \nrelationship with the United States. \nForeign influence concerns \nThe Government urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s immediate and \nextended family members who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh might be subject \nto undue foreign influence by Bangladeshi authorities and terrorists to access classified \ninformation in Applicant\u2019s possession or control. Because Applicant and her family \nmembers who have Bangladesh citizenship and residency, they present potential \nheightened security risks covered by Disqualifying Condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a), \u201ccontact, \nregardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, \nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion,\u201d of the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. \nThe citizenship/residence status of Applicant\u2019s immediate and extended family \nmembers in Bangladesh  poses some potential concerns for Applicant because of the risks \nof undue foreign influence that could compromise classified information under Applicant's \npossession and/or control. DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d has \npossible application due to the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate an extended family \nmembers in Bangladesh. While Applicant has not visited any of her family residing in \nBangladesh since 2016, and has no financial interests or property in Bangladesh that \ncould create potential conflicts of interest, she does maintain frequent telephone contact \nwith her immediate family member. \nFrom what is known from the presented evidence, none of Applicant\u2019s immediate or \nextended family members residing in Bangladesh have any current political or military \naffiliations with Bangladesh government and military officials. Nor do any of her family \nmembers residing in Bangladesh have any history to date of being subjected to any \ncoercion or influence, or appear to be vulnerable to the same. \nThe citizenship status and presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate and extended family \nmembers in Bangladesh pose some risk because of Bangladesh\u2019s growing presence of \nterrorist groups and poor human rights record despite its status as a country with a \nparliamentary system of government committed to upholding the rule of law. Ths risks are \nminimal, though, and are reconcilable with U.S. security interests. Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nher family members are more than neutralized by the former\u2019s demonstrated strong \nloyalties to the United States and manifest commitments to protect this country\u2019s security \ninterests and resist any family pressures that could weaken her fiducial duties to protecting \nclassified information. And, while her father-in-law\u2019s financial gifts to her husband and \nherself have been considerable since she and her husband immigrated to the United \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStates, he has not provided any financial support in recent years (since helping Applicant \nand her husband with medical expenses and the down payment on their home purchase in \n2013). \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing security clearances do not dictate per se \nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are \ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general. What is considered to be an acceptable \nrisk in one foreign country may not be in another. While foreign influence cases must by \npractical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are available for \nreferencing in the supplied materials and country information about Bangladesh. \nThe AGs do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as \nan important consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and \nresidency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The geopolitical aims and policies \nof the particular foreign regime involved do matter. \nApplicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating condition: \nMC \u00b6 8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these \npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such \nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the \ninterests of the United States.\u201d \nBangladesh, with its strong bilateral relationship with the United States and \nparliamentary system of government committed to adherence to the rule of law, remains a \nfree and open society, despite threats of terrorist attacks by al Qa-ida and other notorious \nterrorist groups operating inside of country. And, in the hypothetical situation were \nApplicant\u2019s family members, or any of them, residing in Bangladesh to be pressured, \nApplicant\u2019s strong loyalties and security commitments to the United States make it very \nunlikely that she would permit herself to be pressured into compromising classified \ninformation. \nOf full benefit to Applicant is MC 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because \nthe individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\u2019s demonstrated loyalty, patriotism, and professional \ncommitments to the United States are well demonstrated and enough under these \ncircumstances to neutralize all potential conflicts that are implicit in her relationships with \nher parents and extended family members. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to potential \nconflicts of interests with her immediate and extended family members residing in \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      FOR APPLICANT\n      For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                  \nBangladesh. Not only has Applicant become a naturalized U.S. citizen and received her \nadvanced degrees in the United States, but she has made every effort to work, save, and \npursue her financial interests exclusively in the United States. Applicant is highly regarded \nand trusted by her colleagues and friends who know her well. \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, any likelihood of coercion, pressure, or influence being brought \nto bear on her family members would appear to be minimal.  By all reasonable accounts of \nthe presented record, Applicant has no visible conflicts of interest with Bangladesh and or \nproperty interests in the country that could be put to risk to exploitation or compromise by \nth Bangladesh government authorities, military, or intelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's immediate and \nextended family members residing in Bangladesh are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe \npredictive judgments about her ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to \nher familial relationships in Bangladesh. Her demonstrated loyalties and commitments to \nprotecting U.S. security interests, make it highly unlikely she would succumb to any foreign \ninfluence brought to bear on herself or her family members by Bangladesh government or \nmilitary officials.

Clearance is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the \nGovernment, DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. It recommended that his case be submitted to an administrative judge for a \ndetermination whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nOn October 30, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations, and requested a hearing. On March 7, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \nOn March 22, 2019, the hearing was scheduled for April 10, 2019.  \n \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel submitted two documents for admission that \nI incorporated into the record as Government Exhibits (GEs) 1 and 2. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel submitted three exhibits that I marked and admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) \nA through C. Department Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of the \nfacts set forth in Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through XIII. Because Applicant\u2019s counsel did \nnot receive copies of HE VI through HE XIII before the hearing, I deferred judgment on \nthese documents, and I left the record open through April 26, 2019, to provide \nApplicant\u2019s counsel an opportunity to review the documents and submit any additional \nadministrative notice documents. The day after the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel filed a \nmemo, stating that, upon review, he had no objection of HE VI through XIII. The memo \nalso contained an attached statement from Applicant. Department Counsel had no \nobjection to the post-hearing statement. I am going to take administrative notice of the \nfacts set forth in all of the documents that Department Counsel submitted for \nadministrative notice, and incorporate Applicant\u2019s counsel\u2019s letter with Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing statement as AE D.

(Tr. 23) In 2011, their \nplans were interrupted when Applicant\u2019s father was diagnosed with two life-threatening \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \ndiseases, prompting three years of intensive treatment, including the amputation of \nsome of his toes. Applicant\u2019s father ultimately recovered. (Tr. 18) \n \nShortly after Applicant\u2019s father recovered, Applicant\u2019s mother began experiencing \nhealth problems, prompting a knee replacement surgery in September 2018. She was \nscheduled to have her opposite knee replaced the week after the hearing. (Tr. 18)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents received medical treatment in the UAE from an affiliate of a \nU.S. hospital. They have resumed their plans to relocate to the United States. Applicant \nhas talked to his parents more frequently over the past three years since their health \nproblems. He last traveled to the UAE in April 2018 to help them handle logistics related \nto his father\u2019s various medical procedures. (Tr. 22; GE 2 at 4) Applicant owns no assets \nin the UAE. \n \n \nApplicant has two brothers (B1 and B2) and a sister. All of his siblings live in the \nUnited States. B1 and his sister are naturalized U.S. citizens. B2 is a citizen of Pakistan \nby virtue of his parents\u2019 Pakistani citizenship, and has never lived there. He was born in \nthe UAE in 1982, then moved to the United States in 2001, as a teenager, to attend \ncollege. (Tr. 27) He has lived in the United States since then. (Answer (Enc. 5) He \ncompleted his undergraduate degree and an executive MBA program in the United \nStates. He is married and has one child. Both his wife and his child are U.S. citizens. \n(Tr. 29) He is a management consultant, and he has been a permanent legal U.S. \nresident since 2012. He talks to Applicant approximately twice per month. (Answer, Enc. \n5 at 2) Applicant\u2019s brother has no assets in Pakistan. \n \n \nApplicant has not visited Pakistan in more than 20 years. He has no assets there. \n(Tr. 17) \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nPakistan is a federal republic. It is an important counterterrorism partner, and has \nbeen working to foster political reconciliation between the Afghan government and the \nTaliban. (HE III at 2) However, some terrorist groups operate in remote areas of \nPakistan with impunity. (HE III at 3) Moreover, human rights abuses continue to persist, \nas laws are enforced arbitrarily, criminal suspects are subject to vigilante justice, and \nprivacy rights are routinely violated. (HE V at 1) \n \n \nThe UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates. (HE VII at \n1) The UAE is active partner in countering terrorism and religious extremism. It works \nclosely with several non-governmental organizations in fostering the development of \nonline, anti-terrorist media. (HE VII at 2) The UAE mandates compulsory moral \neducation classes for public and private school students in all grades to promote \nreligious tolerance. (HE VII at 2) Nevertheless, the UAE\u2019s participation in anti-terrorism \ncoalitions generates a moderate risk of terrorism in Abu Dhabi, its capital. (HE XI) \n \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nAs a regional financial hub with a free trade zone, the UAE is challenged with the \nthreat of terrorist organizations laundering money through its financial institutions. (HE \nVII at 2) Also, businesses seeking to evade trade restrictions on commerce with \ncountries such as Iran and Syria have attempted to funnel restricted goods through the \nUAE. (HE X at 4) The UAE has a robust regulatory scheme in place to address these \nissues.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Applicant\u2019s relationship with his parents and one of his \nbrothers, all of whom are citizens of Pakistan, raises the issue of whether the following \ndisqualifying condition is potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents have not lived in Pakistan in more than 40 years. His brother \nhas never lived in Pakistan, has no ties there, and is a citizen simply by virtue of his \nparents\u2019 Pakistani citizenship. He has been living in the United States for nearly 20 \nyears. Applicant has no ties to Pakistan, having relocated from there with his parents \nwhen he was an infant. I conclude that AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply, and that there are no \nforeign influence security concerns stemming from the Pakistani citizenship of \nApplicant\u2019s parents and brother.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents\u2019 residence in the UAE raises the issue of whether AG \u00b6 7(a) \napplies to their relationship with him. The UAE is unequivocally committed to fighting \nterrorism and promoting religious tolerance. Conversely, the UAE\u2019s support for U.S. \nregional objectives has generated a moderate risk of terrorism in its capital. Moreover, \nterrorist organizations and unscrupulous businesses have attempted to exploit the \nUAE\u2019s free trade zone to either launder money or move goods through the UAE to \ncountries that are subject to international import restrictions. \n \n \nOn balance, the risk of exploitation, inducement, or coercion through Applicant\u2019s \nparents is moderated by the UAE\u2019s support for U.S. regional objectives, and its robust \ninitiatives to combat not only terrorism, but religious extremism, as well. Under these \ncircumstances, I conclude that AG \u00b6 7(a) does not apply, and Applicant\u2019s parents living \nin the UAE do not pose a foreign influence security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the their \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nIn addition to the reasons discussed in the analysis, I considered the length of time \nApplicant has been living in the United States, and his thorough integration into U.S. \nsociety, in reaching my decision. \n  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n  \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June \n8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 23, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  The case was assigned to me on January 22, 2019.  \nThe matter was unable to be scheduled until Applicant was back in CONUS.  The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on May 16, 2019, \nand the hearing was convened as scheduled on June 5, 2019.  The Government offered \n\n \n2 \n \nseven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7.  Government Exhibit 4 \nwas admitted over an objection from the Applicant.  (Tr. pp. 28-30.) The other \ndocuments were admitted without objection.  (Tr. pp. 25- 32.)  The Applicant offered \nthree exhibits at the hearing, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, which were \nall admitted without objection.  (Tr. pp. 40-41, 41-42, and 46.)  Applicant testified on his \nown behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 17, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 61 years old.  He is married with two adult children.  He is employed \nby a defense contractor as a Linguist/Translator.  He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant incurred delinquent credit card debt and other \nmiscellaneous consumer debts totaling approximately $38,000.  In his answer, he \nadmits each of the debts listed in the SOR.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated \nNovember 12, 2016; and January 18, 2019, confirm this indebtedness.  (Government \nExhibits 5 and 6.)  Applicant began working for his current employer in September 2016.  \nIn order to upgrade his position with the company, a security clearance is required. \n \nApplicant was born in Afghanistan in November 1957.  He came to the United \nStates in 1986.  He married an Afghan woman in 1988, who later became an American \ncitizen.  He became a naturalized citizen in 1996.  From 2010 to 2013, Applicant worked \nfor a defense contractor.  In 2013, he resigned from his position because he thought the \npay was too low, and he did not want to be away from his wife and family for such long \nperiods.  He was unemployed for about six months before he became an Uber and Lyft \ndriver.  While working as a driver, Applicant\u2019s his income was limited, he was unable to \nafford to pay his bills, and they became delinquent.  In October 2016, Applicant began \nworking for his current employer and has had stable employment since then.  His \npersonal financial statement dated July 29, 2016, shows income of approximately \n$7,000 monthly and is still accurate.  After paying his monthly expenses, Applicant has \nabout $1,000 left in discretionary funds available to pay his delinquent debts, but has \nchosen not to do so.      \n   \nThe following delinquent credit card debt and consumer debt accrued: \n \n1.a.  A delinquent credit card debt, opened in 2006, was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $16,378 and remains delinquent and owing.  Applicant states \nthat he borrowed $10,000 to open a printing business for his son.  The business did not \n\n \n3 \n \ndo well and the account went delinquent in 2017.  Applicant lost approximately $30,000 \nin this venture.  (Tr. p. 65-66.)   \n \n1.b.  A delinquent credit card debt, opened in 2014, is owed to a bank and \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $9,181 remains owing.  Applicant borrowed \nmoney on this credit card for his son\u2019s printing business as well.  (Tr. p. 69.)   \n \n1.c  A  delinquent credit card debt, opened in 2014, was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $6,173 and remains owing.  After losing money on his son\u2019s \nbusiness, this credit card was used to pay for Applicant\u2019s gas and other personal \nexpenses.  (Tr. p. 71.) \n \n1.d.  A delinquent debt, opened in 2016, is owed to a creditor for an account that \nwas placed for collection in the approximate amount of $5,749 and remains owing.  This \nwas for dental work for his son.  (Tr. pp. 74-75 and Government 6.)  Applicant states \nthat he is currently making payments of $240 monthly toward this debt that he started in \nFebruary of this year.  (Tr. p. 75.)  He admitted that after he received the SOR, he \nstarted making these monthly payments.  (Tr. p. 75.) \n \n1.e.  A delinquent debt owed to a department store for an account that was \nplaced for collection in the approximate amount of $655 remains owing.   Applicant \nstates that used the card to purchase clothes for himself, his wife and children. (Tr. p. \n76.) \n \nApplicant states that he promised to pay back everything he owes.  He has a \nplan to pay each of these creditors off next year when he has sufficient monies available \nto do so.    \n \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \n \n \n \nThe Government alleges that the Applicant engaged in conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (e-QIP) dated November 7, \n2016.  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Section 26 of the application asks about his financial \nrecord.  In response to the question that asked whether in the past seven years, he had  \nbills or debts turned over to a collection agency?; had he had any account or credit card \nsuspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed?; had he been over \n120 days delinquent on any debts?; or are is he currently over 120 days delinquent on \nany debts?  Applicant answered, \u201cNO.\u201d  Applicant knew or should have known about his \ndelinquent debts when he completed the application.  He deliberately failed to disclose \nthe debts set forth under subparagraphs 1.a., through 1.e.    \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nIn October 2014, Applicant applied for a position with another defense contractor \nas a Linguist/Translator.  As part of the application process, Applicant was given a \nlanguage proficiency test.  Applicant scored a 4 - plus on this exam, which is a good \nscore.  Applicant stated that he used a dictionary and a smart phone to google his \nanswers.   \n \nIn January 2015, that same defense contractor required the Applicant take \nanother language proficiency test.  This time, it took place in a different state.  Two \nproctors oversaw the exam.  Applicant asked the proctor for a dictionary, and they told \nhim that it was not allowed.  Applicant was also not allowed to google the answers on \nhis smart phone.  Applicant scored a 2 on the exam.  He was asked to read a paragraph \naloud.  He was unable to read the paragraph.  Applicant told the proctor that he could \nnot read and write English very well.  Applicant\u2019s job application with the company was \nsubsequently terminated, and he was not hired for the position.  An incident report \ndated January 22, 2019, prepared by the facility security officer, indicates that Applicant \ncheated on his first exam based upon the fact that he was unable to successfully \ncomplete the requirements on the second exam.  (Government Exhibit 7.)  Applicant \ndenies that he cheated, but does admit that he told the proctor that if he does not have \na dictionary he cannot translate the words from \u201cDari\u201d and \u201cPashto\u201d to English.  He also \ntold them that he does not read or write English well.  (Government Exhibit 7.)     \n \n \nFrom 2010 to 2013, Applicant worked as a competent linguist/translator for his \nprevious employer, the Marine Corps, and other Armed Forces.  During that time, he \nreceived a number of awards and commendations for his excellent service.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit C.) \n \nLetters of recommendation from an Army Intelligence Officer and a Marine Corps \nLinguist Manager attests to Applicant\u2019s hard working nature, and superb work \nperformance.    Applicant is considered a valued member of the team who is technically \ncompetent, loyal, dedicated and has contributed to the success of their operation.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \n\n \n5 \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n6 \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt that he has been unable to afford to pay.  At \nthis time there is insufficient information in the record to conclude that he is now \nfinancially stable, or that he can afford his lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources \navailable to handle his financial obligations.  Except for one debt, the dental bill, no \nregular monthly payments are being made toward his debts, nor has he shown that he \nhas made significant progress in this area.  The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n  \nObviously, Applicant\u2019s decision to invest in his son\u2019s printing business was not a \ngood one.  Applicant borrowed $30,000 to start the business, which he lost in three \n\n \n7 \n \nmonths.  There were circumstances beyond the Applicant\u2019s control that contributed to \nhis financial difficulties.  However, except for a six-month period, Applicant has been \ngainfully employed since he resigned from his position in 2013.  He essentially ignored \nhis delinquent debt until he received the SOR when he started making payments toward \nthe dental bill.  At this point, however, it cannot be said that he is financially stable or \nthat he has made a good faith effort to resolve his indebtedness. \n  \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:       \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.   \n \n \n \nIt is not clear from the evidence presented whether the Applicant actually \ndeliberately cheated on his first language proficiency exam, or whether he was \nmisinformed about the fact that he could use a dictionary or smart phone during the \nexam.  In either case, Applicant admitted to the proctors that he could not read and \nwrite English well.  Based upon this fact, it is puzzling how Applicant worked \ncompetently in his position as a Linguist.  Under the circumstances, however, it cannot \nbe concluded that Applicant cheated on the exam.   \n \n \nOn the other hand, with respect to the Applicant\u2019s responses to Section 26 \nregarding his financial record, Applicant knew or should have known about his \ndelinquent debts.  The Government relies on one\u2019s responses to questions on the \nsecurity clearance application to determine one\u2019s good judgment, trustworthiness and \nreliability.  Applicant was not honest, candid, or truthful in answering the questions \nabout his financial situation.  He cannot be trusted.  Accordingly, it cannot be \ndetermined that he has demonstrated that he is sufficient trustworthy to access \nclassified information.  Under the circumstances, Applicant deliberately falsified his \nsecurity clearance application by failing to disclose his delinquent debts.  There are no \napplicable conditions that could be mitigating under AG \u00b6 17.     \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:, through 1.e.   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nOn October 29, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Applicant timely answered the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on December 28, 2018. Applicant received the FORM on January 8, 2019, and \nhad 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. Applicant did not object to the Government\u2019s evidence, and he provided a \nresponse on February 4, 2019, with several attached documents indicating that several \nsmaller debts, not alleged in the SOR, were paid off. He provided a follow-up email \nresponse to the FORM dated February 18, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, identified \nas Items 1 through 7, is admitted into evidence without objection. The case was \nassigned to me on March 1, 2019.  \n03/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 40 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Air Force (USAF) from \n1997 \u2013 2011. He has been employed as a logistics analyst by a federal contractor since \nDecember 2016. He was unemployed briefly between contract assignments since \nleaving active duty. He has held a second job as a fitness trainer since June 2016. \nApplicant reported a previous security clearance in 1997 from his time on active duty, \nwith no incidents. Applicant has been married and divorced three times: from 2001 to \n2006; from 2006 to 2009; and again from 2010 to 2014. He has two adult children.    \n \nApplicant reported his failure to timely file a federal income tax return, and pay \nincome taxes for tax year (TY) 2015 in section 26 of his security clearance application \n(SCA).2 There, he stated that he relied on a tax-preparation service, which was \neventually shut down by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for filing fraudulent returns. \nConsequently, he owed the IRS $14,000. Applicant claimed that he previously \nestablished a payment plan with the IRS making installment payments of $250 per \nmonth. He provided no substantiating documentation.  \n \nApplicant provided a detailed answer to the SOR on November 28, 2018 \n(Answer). In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegation that he owes the IRS \n$14,000 in overdue federal income taxes at SOR \u00b6 1.i. He also admitted the alleged \ncharged-off and delinquent debts placed for collection alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -1.h. In \nsection 26 of his SCA, he also disclosed consumer debts, which accrued during his \nmarital separation when he used his credit-card to make ends meet. He exhausted his \nsavings waiting for a promised job with a federal contractor in early 2016, but the \ncontract and the job did not materialize.3 The delinquent debts alleged in the SOR \namount to $76,265. \n \nThe mortgage account that is past-due in the amount of $32,761 at SOR \u00b6 1.a \nresulted when his ex-wife occupied their home after they divorced. She did not make \npayments on this joint mortgage and he claims he has been unable to contact her. \n(Answer) The charged-off debt in the amount of $11,748 at SOR \u00b6 1.b was for a vehicle \nthat Applicant could no longer afford after his divorce. He voluntarily surrendered it. \n(Answer) He provided no information about the deficiency owed, or what he did to \nsatisfy it.  \n \nThe charged-off debt in the amount of $9,596 at SOR \u00b6 1.c resulted when \nApplicant was unemployed for several months after resigning from one job with the \nexpectation that another job would commence once a contract was awarded. His \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s August 1, 2017, \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) (Item 4), or his personal security interview (PSI) on May 17, 2018. \n(Item 5)  \n \n2 Item 4.  \n \n3 Item 4, p. 46. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nputative employer lost the contract and the job never materialized. He exhausted his \nsavings in the interim. He was unable to pay the delinquent debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and \n1.e for the same reasons, and stated that he would enter a payment plan or pay these \ndebts. (Answer) No documentation corroborating these claims has been provided.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a debt in the amount of $472 placed for collection by a \ntelecommunications company for a cable box and modem that Applicant says he \nreturned. Applicant disputes the alleged debt in the amount of $489 at SOR \u00b6 1.g. He \nprovided no dispute letter or other evidence. SOR \u00b6 1.h alleges an account placed for \ncollection in the amount of $795. Applicant claims, without substantiation, that he made \nthe final payment in July 2018 and the account is closed. (Answer) \n \n \nApplicant claims to have made arrangements with the IRS to pay $250  a month \nto settle his federal tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. This was being deducted by automatic \ndebit from his previous bank account. (Response to Form) Yet, he provided  no bank \nstatement or evidence of payments. It is unclear why he stopped making the payments \nin the first instance. He provided no evidence that he received financial counseling or \ndebt consolidation assistance.4 He provided no budget showing income against \nexpenses, or other documentation to show progress on his delinquent debts. He \nprofessed his intentions to pay his overdue income taxes and repay his delinquent \ndebts in his SCA in January 2016, and in his PSI in May 2018. He produced no \ndocumentary evidence that he has done so.    \n \n \n \n                                        Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Administrative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines recognize the complexities of human behavior, and are applied \nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period \nand a careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an \naffirmative determination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known \n                                                          \n4 Personal Subject Interview of May 17, 2018, Item 5. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;   \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n \n (f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \n            tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as  \n            required.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay overdue federal income taxes and the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit reports and answer to the SOR. The \nGovernment produced substantial evidence to support the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.5 Applicant has not met that \nburden.   \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n                                                          \n5 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.   \n \n \nApplicant endured several divorces and short periods of unemployment. He has \nbeen assigned overseas for extensive periods of time since leaving active duty. \nArguably, these conditions were beyond his control. Yet, despite his knowledge over \ntwo years ago that his tax delinquency and debts might affect his eligibility for a security \nclearance when he completed his SCA, and then reinforcing his intention to make \npayment arrangements in his PSI, he has done very little to resolve these delinquent \naccounts. He has produced no relevant or responsive documentation either with his \nAnswer to the SOR, or in response to the FORM. He has not demonstrated that he \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has the burden to provide \nsufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are under control, and that his \ndebts were incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. He admitted his financial mistakes \nand overdue federal income taxes. Applicant\u2019s credit reports and SOR list the \ndelinquent tax, credit-card, and consumer debts totaling $76,265. Applicant did not \nprovide enough details with documentary corroboration about what he did to address \nhis SOR debts. He did not provide documentation relating to any of the SOR debts: (1) \nproof of payments, such as checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a \nletter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditors; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditors to establish maintenance of contact; (3) \ncredible debt disputes indicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debts and \nwhy he held such a belief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, \nsuch as settlement offers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve \nthese debts; or (5) other evidence of progress or resolution. \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel informed Applicant that it was important for \nhim to provide corroborating or supporting documentation of resolution of the debt in the \nSOR. (FORM at 3) Aside from Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements, there is no \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, disputed, compromised, or \notherwise resolved the SOR debts. He did not describe financial counseling or provide \nhis budget. The record lacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed \nexplanations of the causes for his financial problems and other mitigating information.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n\n \n7 \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant has served on active duty, or as a civilian \ncontractor, in support of DOD and U.S. interests for most of his adult life. Notably, \nApplicant has derived his income primarily from taxpayer-funded federal contractors \nsince leaving active duty. Yet, he has not adequately explained his failure to pay federal \nincome taxes owed. He has gone through divorce and an unexpected loss of household \nincome, but he has been employed most of his adult life. Most importantly, Applicant \nhas not addressed the specific allegations in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. He has not met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.i:               \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

He did not make sufficient progress resolving his delinquent debts. Foreign \ninfluence and financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 8, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On November 19, 2018, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; \nand Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \n\n \n2   \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations), E (personal conduct), and B (foreign influence). \n \nOn February 1, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On April 17, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 25, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to another administrative judge, and on July 27, 2019, the case \nwas transferred to me for administrative reasons. On August 16, 2019, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing \nfor September 16, 2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered six exhibits; Applicant offered \ntwo exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 22-28; Government Exhibit (GE) 1-6; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-\nB). On September 25, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing.   \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel offered summaries for administrative notice concerning \nforeign influence security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s connections to Iraq and UAE. \n(Tr. 25; HE 5) Applicant did not object to me taking administrative notice of those facts, \nand I granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 25) Administrative or official notice is \nthe appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. \n16-02522 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 12, 2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. \nApr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice \nat ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government \nreports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing \nfifteen types of facts for administrative notice). Portions of the Department Counsel\u2019s \nrequests are quoted without quotation marks and footnotes. Administrative notice is also \ntaken of recent authoritative news reports. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 23, 2007). \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to withdraw the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2 (personal \nconduct). (Tr. 14-15) Applicant did not object, and Department Counsel\u2019s motion was \ngranted. (Tr. 15) \n \nThe facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of \nwitnesses, names of other groups, or locations in order to protect Applicant and her \nfamily\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \n \n\n \n3   \n                                                                                                                                              \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant denied all of the SOR allegations. He also provided some admissions \nand mitigating information in his response. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 43 years old, and he is seeking a security clearance to enable him to \nbecome a linguist in Iraq employed by a DOD contractor. (Tr. 6, 29; GE 1) Applicant has \nbeen unemployed since April 2016, except for some part-time employment in 2019 for \nabout three months. (Tr. 41-45). He lives with and takes care of his mother, who is \ndisabled. (GE 3 at 4-6) From April 2009 to April 2016, he worked in the area of petroleum \nas a senior technical editor. (Tr. 34) He has not served in the military of any country. (Tr. \n8, 29; GE 3 at 8) He was married from 2009 to 2014. (Tr. 8-9) His \u201cmarriage\u201d was \nactually a Muslim joining ceremony, and he did not consider it a legally-binding marriage. \n(Tr. 35-36; GE 3 at 5) Because he did not have a legally-binding marriage, he has not \nobtained a divorce. (GE 3 at 5) He does not have any children. In 1996, he was awarded \na bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical engineering in Iraq. (Tr. 6, 29; GE 3 at 4) He attended \ngraduate school in Malaysia in environmental compliance engineering. (Tr. 7, 29-31; GE \n3 at 4) Unless stated otherwise, the information in this paragraph is from Applicant\u2019s \nSCA. (GE 1) \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe credit reports and SOR list eight delinquent debts totaling $14,393 as follows: \n\u00b6 1.a alleges a charged-off bank debt for $3,900; \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off bank debt \nfor $3,744; \u00b6 1.c alleges a charged-off bank debt for $3,676; \u00b6 1.d alleges a charged-off \ndebt for $927; \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f allege two debts placed for collection for $837 and $543 \nthat are owed to the same entity; \u00b6 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $528; and \n\u00b6 1.h alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $238. (Tr. 87; GE 4-6) \n \nIn February 2016, Applicant visited UAE for about one month. (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18) \nFrom July to September 2016, he stayed in UAE for more than 30 days. (Tr. 63; GE 1; \nGE 2 at 18-19) From August to September 2016, he visited Bulgaria, the United \nKingdom, Romania, Kuwait, and Lebanon. (GE 2 at 19) In October 2016, he visited \nEgypt, Oman, and UAE. (GE 2 at 20) In April 2017, he visited the United Kingdom, \nSpain, and Turkey. (GE 2 at 5, 20) In May 2017, he visited Canada. (GE 2 at 20) From \nJune to July 2017, he stayed in UAE for more than 30 days. In June 2017, he visited \nIraq. (Tr. 64-65; GE 2 at 21) In August 2017, he visited the country of Georgia and UAE. \n(GE 2 at 22) In May 2018, he visited Canada. (Tr. 69) In March 2019, he visited Iceland \nand France. (Tr. 69) From July to September 2019, he visited the United Kingdom, \nGermany, and Greece. (Tr. 67-68) He said he funded his travel with money from his \nmother and his savings. (Tr. 70) He said he did not use his travel funds to pay his \ndelinquent debts because he believed a debt resolution or consolidation company \n(DRCC) resolved or paid all of his delinquent debts. (Tr. 110) Unless stated otherwise, \nthe information in this paragraph is from Applicant\u2019s SCA. (GE 1) \n \n\n \n4   \n                                                                                                                                              \nDuring Applicant\u2019s November 2017 counterintelligence screening questionnaire, \nhe was advised that his credit report contained seven unpaid debts totaling about \n$12,500. (GE 2 at 9-12) Applicant said he could not afford to pay the debts, and he \nbelieved a debt resolution or consolidation company (DRCC) either resolved his debts or \nhe was using DRCC to pay his debts. (GE 2 at 9-12) After he became unemployed, he \nreceived food stamps, and his primary source of revenue has been from his mother. (GE \n3 at 5)  \n \nIn his February 26, 2018 Office of Personnel Management personal subject \ninterview (OPM PSI), Applicant said he had a debt consolidation agreement from 2014 to \n2015. (GE 3 at 6) The OPM investigator confronted him with nine delinquent accounts \nbased on his credit report. (GE 3 at 7) In October 2018, Applicant acknowledged the \naccuracy of the summary of his OPM interview. (GE 3 at 12) Applicant accepted \nresponsibility for the debts, and he said he made $400 monthly payments for 18 months \nto DRCC to resolve his debts. (GE 3 at 7) He said the accounts became delinquent in \n2014 because he was providing financial support to a friend who was ill (Tr. 51-52, 89-\n90); however, he said he had no reason to believe that DRCC had not resolved his \ndebts. (GE 3 at 7)  \n \nApplicant signed a contract with DRCC in October 2015. (AE B at 12) Applicant \nsaid he paid DRCC for about 12 or 18 months, and they promised to pay off his debts. \n(Tr. 94-102, 105-106) Applicant agreed to pay DRCC $445 monthly from October 2015 \nto September 2017 to address six debts including the four debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($3,900), 1.b ($3,744), 1.c ($3,676), and 1.d ($927), and two additional non-SOR debts \n($11,155) and ($613). (AE B at 8-10) Applicant\u2019s DRCC contract specified that funds \npaid to DRCC are not paid to creditors, and those funds received from Applicant are \nused to pay DRCC\u2019s fees. (AE B at 6) The contract states that DRCC is \u201cnot a debt \nconsolidation or debt settlement company,\u201d and DRCC does not settle debts. (AE B at 6)  \n \nApplicant provided emails from DRCC from October 16, 2015, to August 2, 2016. \n(AE A) These emails corroborate Applicant\u2019s statement that he was paying DRCC\u2019s fee \nfor about one year. DRCC provided information in the emails about how to avoid identity \ntheft and how he could increase his income. DRCC also sent correspondence to credit \nreporting companies and creditors. (AE A) Applicant did not submit the correspondence \nDRCC sent to financial entities into evidence at his hearing. (Tr. 101-104; AE A) \nApplicant did not provide any evidence of any payments or of any efforts to initiate \npayment plans with any of the SOR creditors by Applicant or DRCC.   \n \nApplicant expects to earn about $6,700 monthly if he is hired as a linguist. (Tr. 48) \nIf he is hired as a linguist he intends to pay his debts within a short time after beginning \nthis employment. (Tr. 88) \n \nForeign Influence \n \nFrom 1996 to 2000, Applicant attended college in Malaysia. (GE 2 at 1, 4) From \n2000 to 2004, he lived in the United Kingdom. (GE 2 at 1) From 2004 to 2010, he lived \nin Iraq, and in 2010, he emigrated from Iraq to the United States with his parents as a \n\n \n5   \n                                                                                                                                              \nrefugee. (Tr. 37; GE 2 at 1, 3) He also brought his \u201cwife\u201d to the United States; several \nmonths later, he lost contact with her; and he was unable to provide information about \nhis former wife. (Tr. 35-41) In 2015, Applicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. (GE 2 \nat 3)  \n \nApplicant repeatedly emphasized that he is loyal to the United States and had no \npreference for any other foreign country. The Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the \nUnited States of America states: \n \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod. \n \nThe language of the current Oath of Allegiance is found in the Code of Federal \nRegulations Section 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section \n337(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \n8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1448, https://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-\noath-allegiance-united-states-america. I found Applicant\u2019s statements about his loyalty to \nthe United States to be sincere and credible. I am convinced that Applicant is a loyal \nU.S. citizen. \n \nThe SOR alleges in \u00b6 3.a that Applicant\u2019s sister is a citizen of Iraq and a resident \nof UAE, in \u00b6 3.b that his brother-in-law is a resident of UAE, and in \u00b6 3.c that his nephew \nis a resident of UAE. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father was born in Iraq, and in 2016, he passed away. (Tr. 45; GE 1; \nGE 2 at 14) Applicant\u2019s mother is 70 years old, and she was born in Iraq. (Tr. 46-47; GE \n1) She is a U.S. citizen, and she resides in the United States. (GE 1) She is disabled. \n(Tr. 46-47; GE 3 at 6) Applicant\u2019s mother is aware that Applicant is seeking employment \nas a linguist and is seeking a security clearance. (GE 3 at 6) If he is hired as a linguist \nand deployed to Iraq, he plans for his mother to live with his sister-in-law in UAE or in \nIraq with another relative. (Tr. 48, 49, 108) He will have frequent contact with his mother, \nand he will provide financial support for her while she is in UAE. (Tr. 48-49) The SOR \ndoes not allege a security concern relating to Applicant\u2019s mother. Consideration of \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his mother, and his mother\u2019s relationships with other family \nmembers is limited to mitigation and whole-person purposes. His family in UAE is not \naware that he has applied to become a linguist. (Tr. 52) \n \n\n \n6   \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant\u2019s sister is 55 years old; she was born in Iraq and has lived in UAE for \nabout 20 years; she is an engineering teacher; and Applicant had monthly contact with \nher before May 2018; and after May 2018, he did not have direct contact with her. (Tr. \n55-56, 84, 85; GE 2 at 14, 16) His sister\u2019s spouse is 56 years old; he lives in UAE; he is \nan Iraqi citizen; and he is an engineer. (Tr. 57-58; GE 3 at 9-10) They have four children. \n(Tr. 58) Their 29-year-old son also lives in UAE, and is an engineer. (Tr. 59; GE 3 at 9-\n10) Applicant did not know whether his nephew held UAE government employment. (Tr. \n60) They hold Iraqi passports. (GE 3 at 9) Applicant did not want his mother to sponsor \nthem for U.S. residence because of their radical, anti-United States statements. (GE 3 at \n9) In 2017, Applicant was watching the news with them in UAE, and a hurricane was \napproaching Florida. (Tr. 75-77; GE 3 at 9) They started saying prayers asking God to \ndrown the infidels of America. (Tr. 75-77; GE 3 at 9) When they remembered that \nApplicant was American, they stopped their anti-American statements. Applicant\u2019s \nbrother-in-law had radical anti-American views and made several anti-American \nstatements over the past twenty years. (GE 3 at 10) His brother-in-law and nephew \nattend a radical mosque in UAE. (Tr. 79, 84; GE 3 at 9-10) Applicant did not attend the \nmosque himself. (Tr. 79) Applicant was very unhappy about their anti-American \ncomments. (Tr. 77) Applicant strenuously objected to any aspersions cast against his \nloyalty to the United States. (Tr. 17-19, 77-78, 111) \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law cried when Saddam Hussein was executed in 2006 by \nIraqi authorities, and his brother-in-law was aligned with the Baath Party before leaving \nIraq. (Tr. 82; GE 3 at 10) He hates the current government of Iraq. (Tr. 83) His brother-in-\nlaw made numerous statements supporting the downfall of the United States. (Tr. 82) \nApplicant\u2019s sister has changed and become sympathetic towards her husband\u2019s views. \n(Tr. 80; GE 3 at 10) His sister and her spouse do not wish to return to Iraq. (GE 3 at 10) \nApplicant reported the information about his sister and her spouse out of loyalty for the \nUnited States. (GE 3 at 9-10) Applicant emphasized that he loves his sister. (Tr. 77, 80, \n82, 111)  \n   \nApplicant said he ended his direct contacts with his sister in UAE in May 2018. \n(Tr. 85-86) Applicant\u2019s mother contacts his sister in UAE about once a week. (Tr. 86) \nApplicant has indirect contact with his sister in UAE through his mother. (Tr. 85) His \nmother uses WhatsApp and Viper, which are computer applications that enable users to \ncommunicate with individuals and groups of people, including sending pictures and \nvideos at the same time. (Tr. 85, 109; GE 3 at 5)  \n \nIraq \n \nThe Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The \noutcome of the 2014 parliamentary elections generally met international standards of \nfree and fair elections and led to the peaceful transition of power from former prime \nminister Nuri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. \n \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iraq is Level 4: \u201cDo not travel to \nIraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.\u201d U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and \n\n \n7   \n                                                                                                                                              \nregularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may \nalso threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by \nimprovised explosive devices (IEDs) occur frequently in many areas of the country, \nincluding Baghdad. The U.S. Government\u2019s ability to provide routine and emergency \nservices to U.S. citizens in Iraq is extremely limited. \n \nU.S. citizens in Iraq remain at critical risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. \nThe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a designated terrorist organization \nconducting an active insurgency in Syria, with franchises or direct links to terrorist \ngroups in Iraq and other parts of the world. It commits terrorist attacks, violent atrocities, \nand targets U.S. citizens. ISIS controls some areas of Syria on the Iraqi border. The \nIraqi government declared all of its territory liberated from ISIS in December 2017; \nhowever, despite proved government control, ISIS remains a threat to public safety in \nIraq through the indiscriminate use of terrorist and asymmetrical attacks. Additionally, \ncriminal gangs and local militias pose a potential threat to U.S. citizens. \n \nThe Department of State has assessed Baghdad as being a critical-threat \nlocation for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. \nSince August 2014, ISIS has been responsible for the majority of terrorist incidents and \nattacks in Iraq. Although the Iraqi government declared victory over ISIS in December \n2017, it anticipates that remaining ISIS fighters will go underground and form insurgent \ncells throughout Iraq. These cells are expected to conduct high profile attacks on Iraqi \nSecurity Forces personnel, Iraqi government installations, and other soft targets in \nmajor Iraqi population centers Anti-American/anti-western sentiment exists throughout \nIraq. The threat of kidnapping, rocket attack, or the use of lEDs and small-arms fire \nagainst official and private U.S. interests remains high and is subject to the influence of \ndomestic, regional, and international developments. Iranian-backed Shia militias, such \nas Asa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq, Kata\u2019ib Hizballah, and Muqtada al Sadr\u2019s nationalistic Peace \nBrigades Militia have targeted U.S. interests. There are reports of Shia militia groups \nkidnapping locals, foreign workers, and members of international organizations and \ndemanding ransoms from either their families or their employers. A number of these \ngroups are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a considerable potential threat, as either \norganized groups or individually as \u201crogue\u201d elements that may take independent action.  \n \nThe U.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. \nGovernment personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work \nunder strict security guidelines. In December 2017, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad \nexpanded its temporary movement restriction to include movements both inside and \noutside the international zone in response to the recent announcement that the United \nStates recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  \n \nIn its 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism, the U.S. Department of State reported \nthat by the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces, with the support of the U.S.-led Global \nCoalition to Defeat ISIS, had reclaimed all of the territory that ISIS had captured in 2014 \nand 2015. As ISIS retreated from Mosul and other cities, its fighters used IEDs, \nhomemade mines, and mortars to booby trap homes, public spaces, and critical \ninfrastructure to impede the movement of Iraq\u2019s security forces and terrorize returning \n\n \n8   \n                                                                                                                                              \nresidents. ISIS maintained the capability to conduct terrorist attacks. Kata\u2019ib Hizballah, a \ndesignated foreign terrorist organization, continued to operate in Iraq during 2017, \nexacerbating sectarian tensions.  \n \nAccording to the United Nations, acts of terrorism, violence, and armed conflict \nwith ISIS killed more than 3,000 civilians and injured more than 4,600 in Iraq in 2017. \nISIS\u2019 continued ability to use captured and improved military equipment allowed it to \nemploy sophisticated methods including the use of armored vehicle-borne IEDs and \nchlorine gas. ISIS continued to commit atrocities involving the use of child soldiers, \nmass murder, enslavement of ethnic and religious minorities, rape, forced marriage, and \nexecuting civilians, including women and children, attempting to flee its rule. ISIS \ncontinued to carry out suicide and hit-and-run attacks throughout the country, the most \nsignificant occurring on September 14, 2017, during a coordinated attack on a security \ncheckpoint and restaurant on the outskirts of Nasariyah that killed more than 80 Iraqis. \nOn January 13, 2018, a suicide vest attack was conducted against an Iraqi Security \nForces checkpoint in Baghdad, resulting in over 12 casualties. Two days later, twin \nsuicide vest attacks killed over 36 civilians in central Baghdad. The attacks targeted \nIraqi day laborers as they gathered in search of work. ISIS claimed responsibility for the \nattacks in the following days.  \n \nIn February 2018, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI), in his \nStatement for the Record, Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence \nCommunity, provided the following assessment of the situation in Iraq: \n \nOver the next year, we expect that ISIS is likely to focus on regrouping in \nIraq and Syria, enhancing its global presence, championing its cause, \nplanning international attacks, and encouraging its members and \nsympathizers to attack in their home countries . . . ISIS core has started-\nand probably will maintain-a robust insurgency in Iraq and Syria as part of \na long-term strategy to ultimately enable the reemergence of its so-called \ncaliphate. This activity will challenge local [counter-terrorism] efforts \nagainst the group and threaten US interests in the region. \n \nIran\u2019s support for the Popular Mobilization Committee (PMC) and Shia \nmilitants remains the primary threat to US personnel in Iraq. We assess \nthat this threat will increase as the threat from ISIS recedes, especially \ngiven calls from some Iranian backed groups for the United States to \nwithdraw [from Iraq] and growing tension between Iran and the United \nStates. \n \nIraq is likely to face a lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict as it \nstruggles to rebuild, reconstitute the Iraqi state, maintain pressure on ISIS, \nand rein in the Iranian-backed Shia militias that pose an enduring threat to \nUS personnel . . . ISIS will remain a terrorist and insurgent threat, and the \ngroup will seek to exploit Sunni discontent to conduct attacks and try to \nregain Iraqi territory . . . There is an increasing risk that some Shi a \nmilitants will seek to attack US targets in Iraq . . . Despite ISIS\u2019 loss of \n\n \n9   \n                                                                                                                                              \nterritory, the social and political challenges that gave rise to the group \nremain and threaten the cohesion of the Iraqi state. \n \nIn December 2015, President Obama signed into law the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act of 2015, which amended the existing \nVisa Waiver Program. Under the 2015 amendment, citizens of lran, Iraq, Sudan, and \nSyria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver \nProgram. The exclusion of these countries from waiver eligibility reflects the \ndetermination of the Secretary of Homeland Security that the presence of an individual \nin that country increases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat to the \nnational security of the United States; that a foreign terrorist organization has a \nsignificant presence in the country; or that the county is a safe haven for terrorists. \n \nIn its 2017 Human Rights Report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \nviolence continued in Iraq throughout 2017, largely fueled by the actions of ISIS. Iraqi \ngovernment forces successfully fought to liberate territory taken earlier by ISIS, \nincluding Mosul, while ISIS sought to demonstrate its viability through targeted attacks. \nArmed clashes between ISIS and government forces caused civilian deaths and \nhardship. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from ISIS, \ndrastically reducing ISIS\u2019s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. \n \nDuring 2017, Iraq \u2018s most significant human rights issues included allegations of \nunlawful killings by some members of the Iraqi Security Forces, particularly some \nelements of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF); disappearance and extortion by \nPMF elements; torture; harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison \nfacilities; \narbitrary \narrest \nand \ndetention; \narbitrary \ninterference \nwith \nprivacy; \ncriminalization of libel and other limits on freedom of expression, including press \nfreedoms; violence against journalists; widespread official corruption; greatly reduced \npenalties for so-called \u201chonor killings\u201d; coerced or forced abortions imposed by ISIS on \nits victims; legal restrictions on freedom of movement of women; and trafficking in \npersons. Militant groups killed LGBTI persons. There were also limitations on worker \nrights, including restrictions on formation of independent unions. \n \nISIS committed the majority of serious abuses and atrocities occurring in Iraq in \n2017. ISIS members committed acts of violence on a mass scale, including killings \nthrough suicide bombings and IEDs; executions including shootings and public \nbeheadings; use of civilians as human shields; as well as use of chemical weapons. \nThey also engaged in kidnapping, rape, enslavement, forced marriage, and sexual \nviolence, committing such acts against civilians from a wide variety of religious and \nethnic backgrounds, including Shia, Sunnis, Kurds, Christians, Yezidis, and members of \nother religious and ethnic groups. Reports of ISIS perpetrating gender-based violence, \nrecruiting child soldiers, trafficking in persons, and destroying civilian infrastructure and \ncultural heritage sites were credible and common. On August 15, 2017, then-U.S. \nSecretary of State Tillerson stated that, \u201cISIS is clearly responsible for genocide against \nYezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims in areas it controls or has controlled. ISIS is also \nresponsible for crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing directed at these same \ngroups, and in some cases against Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and other minorities.\u201d \n\n \n10   \n                                                                                                                                              \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE) \n \nThe UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates - Abu Zaby \n(Abu Dhabi), \u2018Ajman, Al Fujayrah, Ash Shariqah (Sharjah), Dubayy (Dubai), Ra\u2019s al \nKhaymah, and Umm al Qaywayn. The rulers of the seven emirates constitute the \nFederal Supreme Council, the country\u2019s highest legislative and executive body. The \nemirates are under patriarchal rule with political allegiance defined by loyalty to tribal \nleaders, leaders of the individual emirates, and leaders of the federation. \n \nIn its 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism, the U.S. Department of State reported \nthat during 2017, the UAE remained a regional and global financial and transportation \nhub, and terrorist organizations exploited it to send and receive financial support. \nOperational capability constraints and political considerations sometimes prevented the \nUAE government from immediately freezing and confiscating terrorist assets, absent \nmultilateral assistance. The UAE is a drug transshipment point for traffickers, given its \nproximity to Southwest Asian drug-producing countries, and its position as a major \nfinancial center makes it vulnerable to money laundering. Anti-money laundering \ncontrols are improving, but informal banking remains unregulated.  \n \nExcept for free trade zones specifically established for financial activities, which \nare well regulated, the UAE\u2019s numerous free trade zones vary in their compliance with \nand supervision of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism \ninternational best practices. Exploitation by illicit actors of money transmitters, including \nlicensed exchange houses, hawalas, and trading firms acting as money transmitters, \nremains a significant concern.  \n \nAs the following examples demonstrate, through transshipment and diversion, \nU.S. goods, dual use, military and electronic components, and internet technology have \npassed through the UAE and UAE-owned businesses on their way to Iran and Syria: \nBetween 2005 and 2007, U.S. companies were misled into shipping aircraft parts to the \nUAE that were actually destined for customers in Iran. Between 2007 and 2008, at least \nseven shipments of vacuum pumps and equipment related to uranium enrichment were \nshipped to Iran through a free trade zone located in the UAE, in a manner that made it \nappear that the UAE was the ultimate destination. In 2008, U.S. dual-use and military \ncomponents were funneled through the UAE to Iran and were used in improvised \nexplosive devices (IEDs) employed against coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In \n2009, a U.S. company conspired to export a steel bar peeling machine to Iran, through \nthe UAE, in violation of the Iran embargo. In 2014, a UAE company violated its reseller \nagreement with a U.S. software company and illegally diverted internet monitoring \ntechnology to Syria. In 2016, high-tech electronic components from U.S. companies \nwere illegally transshipped through the UAE on their way to Iran.  \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Abu Dhabi and Dubai as being \nmedium-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. \nGovernment interests. The Department of State remains concerned about the global \nthreat of terrorism, including the continuing possibility of terrorist attacks against U.S. \ncitizens and interests in the Arabian Gulf and Arabian Peninsula. Elevated security \n\n \n11   \n                                                                                                                                              \nthreats have the potential to affect security in the UAE, particularly as the UAE \ncontinues taking on a more prominent role countering extremism in the region. The \nUAE\u2019s participation in the anti ISIS coalition and the ongoing Yemen civil war has raised \nthe overall likelihood of terrorist attacks against Western interests. \n \nThe UAE is a member of a Saudi-led coalition that was formed to counter the \n2014 overthrow of the legitimate government of Yemen by militias known colloquially as \n\u201cHouthis,\u201d and forces loyal to the former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. During \n2018, UAE forces continued an active military role in Yemen, including conducting \nground operations against al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and the Islamic State in \nsouthern Yemen. Iran\u2019s support to the Houthis in Yemen has escalated the conflict and \nposes a serious threat to U.S. partners and interests in the region. Such efforts include \nan attempted December 3, 2017, cruise missile attack on an unfinished nuclear reactor \nin Abu Dhabi.  \n \nOn September 21, 2019, the Secretary of Defense announced that the President \nhad approved defensive deployment of some DOD forces to UAE and increased military \nsales in response to the September 2019 drone-missile attack on Saudi Arabian oil \nfields. \u201cU.S. to deploy military forces to Saudi Arabia, UAE after drone attacks on oil \nsites,\u201d NBC News website (Sept. 21, 2019), https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-\nnews/u-s-deploy-military-forces-saudi-arabia-after-drone-attacks-n1057216. \n \nIn its 2017 Human Rights Report, the U.S. Department of State reported that \ncivilian authorities in the UAE maintained effective control over the security forces. The \nmost significant human rights issues included allegations of torture in detention; \narbitrary arrest and detention, including incommunicado detention; government \ninterference with privacy rights, including criminalization of libel and arrests and \ndetentions for internet postings or commentary; restrictions on assembly and \nassociation; and the inability of citizens to choose their government in free and fair \nelections. Some press reports and human rights organizations alleged that UAE and \nDAE-supported local Yemeni forces abducted, arbitrarily detained, and tortured \nindividuals as part of counterterrorism efforts in Southern Yemen.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \n\n \n12   \n                                                                                                                                              \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision should \nbe construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any \nexpress or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is \nmerely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President,  \nSecretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \n     \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n13   \n                                                                                                                                              \nAnalysis \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 has conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to his sister, and his sister\u2019s connections \nto her spouse, who are residents of UAE, and his sister\u2019s connections to Iraq are \nsufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). Applicant is not close enough to his nephew \nliving in UAE to establish a security concern. SOR \u00b6 3.c is refuted. \n \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \n \nThere are widely documented safety issues for residents of Iraq and to a lesser \ndegree in UAE primarily because of terrorists and criminals. Numerous linguists have \nfamily living in countries that have problems with terrorists and criminals.    \n\n \n14   \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a foreign country \nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his \nor her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship \nwith even one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create \nthe potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) \n(discussing problematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran).  \n  \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. 05-\n00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. \n20, 2002).    \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has indicated for Guideline B cases, \u201cthe nature of the \nforeign government involved and the intelligence-gathering history of that government \nare among the important considerations that provide context for the other record \nevidence and must be brought to bear on the Judge\u2019s ultimate conclusions in the case. \nThe country\u2019s human rights record is another important consideration.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n16-02435 at 3 (May 15, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00528 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 13, \n2017)). Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement.  \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationships of Iraq and UAE with the United States, and the situation in those \ncountries places a burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with any family member living in or visiting Iraq or UAE does not pose a \nsecurity risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist a relative living in or \nvisiting Iraq or UAE.  \n \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-\n*21 n. 18 (App. Bd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \n \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate \nfamily members in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power \nbased on their prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is \nwhether an applicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members \nin a foreign country raise security concerns because those ties and \n\n \n15   \n                                                                                                                                              \ncontacts create a potential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to \nexploit in an effort to get unauthorized access to U.S. classified \ninformation that an applicant -- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers -- has by virtue of a security clearance. A person may be \nvulnerable to influence or pressure exerted on, or through, the person\u2019s \nimmediate family members -- regardless of whether the person\u2019s family \nmembers are prominent or not. \n \nGuideline B security or trustworthiness concerns are not limited to countries \nhostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting \nand safeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or country that is \nnot authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or \ncountry has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 \nat 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. See ISCR Case No. 02-22461, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 1570 at *11-*12 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-26976 at 5-6 (App. Bd.

International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Iraq and UAE have a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in those countries \u201ccould \nbe a means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd.

These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel \nproduced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s relationships with family in UAE and has \nraised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of any mitigating \nconditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \n\n \n16   \n                                                                                                                                              \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for \nproving the applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant lives with his mother, and he and his mother are close to Applicant\u2019s \nsister, who lives in UAE. Applicant, his mother, and his sister, and brother-in-law were \nborn in Iraq. The connections to Iraq of his mother, sister, and brother-in-law are not \ndescribed in detail. Applicant stayed with his sister and brother-in-law in UAE for \nextended periods of time. His sister and her spouse have radicalized against the United \n\n \n17   \n                                                                                                                                              \nStates. If Applicant secures employment as a linguist in Iraq, he plans to have his mother \nlive with his radicalized sister in UAE. His mother knows Applicant will be working for the \nUnited States in Iraq, and that he has applied for a security clearance. There is a risk \nthat those who hate the United States will learn from Applicant\u2019s sister or her spouse that \nApplicant has U.S. employment in Iraq; and they might communicate with elements in \nUAE or Iraq that they should attempt to coerce Applicant for classified information. \nApplicant will be in Iraq where he is more available for coercion than if he resided in the \nUnited States. Applicant did not rule out that he might visit his radicalized sister in the \nUAE, which would increase the potential for compromise of classified information.  \n \nApplicant has frequent contacts with his mother, and she has frequent contact \nwith Applicant\u2019s sister, who is a resident of UAE. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant \nresided in the United States from 2010 to present, except for when he was traveling \noutside the United States. Applicant and his mother are naturalized U.S. citizens.  \n      \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with relatives who are residents \nof UAE. Applicant has close relationships with family in that country, and they are at risk \nfrom criminals, terrorists, and human rights violations of UAE\u2019s government. The \nprimary risk is through his sister and her husband\u2019s relationships with those who hate \nthe United States.  \n \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 huge historical investment of \nmanpower and money in the Middle East. The United States needs linguists who \nunderstand Middle Eastern countries to assist in the accomplishment of various U.S. \nmissions. Applicant\u2019s family members living in UAE are potential targets of terrorists, \nand Applicant\u2019s potential access to classified information could theoretically add risk to \nhis relatives living in UAE.    \n \nIn sum, Applicant and his mother\u2019s connections to their relatives living in UAE are \ntoo significant to mitigate in the circumstances Applicant presented. His sister and her \nhusband are radicalized against the United States. His connections to the United States \ntaken together are not sufficient to overcome the foreign influence security concerns \nunder Guideline B.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n\n \n18   \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets \nas well as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt from 2014 to present establishes AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c).  \n \nSeven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n\n \n19   \n                                                                                                                                              \nApplicant has been unemployed since April 2016, except for some part-time \nemployment in 2019 for about three months. He provided financial support for a friend \nand his family. He lives with and takes care of his mother, who is disabled. These are \ncircumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his finances. However, these \nfinancial circumstances are insufficiently detailed to prove he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. Applicant did not establish that from April 2016 to present he was \nunable to earn enough income or apply some of the travel funds from his mother to \naddress his delinquent debts. He did not provide proof that he diligently sought or was \nunable to seek any employment. \n \nApplicant was misled by DRCC from October 16, 2015, to August 2, 2016 about \nresolution of his delinquent debts. Once he was confronted with the fact that the debts \nwere unresolved, he had an obligation to investigate the situation and take action to \nresolve his delinquent debts. He did not act prudently or responsibly after he learned the \ndebts were not resolved.   \n \nApplicant made numerous trips to European and Asian countries from April 2016 \nto present. He did not establish that he was unable to use some of the funds expended \non travel to address his delinquent debts. He failed to establish mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n  \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuidelines B and F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors \nin AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional \ncomments. \n \nApplicant is 43 years old, and he is seeking a security clearance to enable him to \nbecome a linguist to support a DOD contractor in Iraq. From April 2009 to April 2016, he \nworked in the area of petroleum as a senior technical editor. He is not married, and he \n\n \n20   \n                                                                                                                                              \ndoes not have any children. He was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in chemical \nengineering in Iraq. He attended graduate school in Malaysia in environmental \ncompliance engineering.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR lists eight delinquent debts totaling $14,393. Applicant has been \nunemployed since April 2016. He lives with and takes care of his mother, who is \ndisabled. He made numerous trips to European and Asian countries after April 2016. He \ndid not prove he was unable to find employment or use his any of his travel funds to \nmake any payments to address his delinquent debts.    \n \nApplicant is very close to his mother, and his mother has frequent contacts with \nApplicant\u2019s sister, who is a resident of UAE. His sister is close to her husband who lives \nwith her in UAE. Applicant loves his sister. Applicant and his mother\u2019s relationships with \nand loyalty to family in UAE are positive character traits; however, they raise important \nforeign influence security concerns. Applicant indicated his sister and her husband have \nbeen radicalized against the United States, and they prayed for the deaths of U.S. \ncitizens and residents. \u201cIt is the established policy of the Department of Defense that \u201can \nindividual\u2019s religious affiliation plays no part in the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 11-02842 at 3 (App. Bd. June 7, 2012) (citing ISCR Case No. 10-02902 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 16, 2011)).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s connections to foreign countries must be balanced against \nconnections to the United States. Applicant has resided in the United States since 2010. \nHe is a loyal U.S. citizen. He honestly and sincerely described his love for the United \nStates. In 2015, he took an oath of allegiance to the United States. His mother is a \ncitizen and resident of the United States.       \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning UAE and Iraq must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation and dangers in those countries. See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient discussion of geopolitical \nsituation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). Iraq and to a lesser \ndegree UAE are dangerous places because of violence from terrorists and criminals, \nand the Iraq and UAE governments do not respect the full spectrum of human rights. \nTerrorists and criminals continue to threaten the Iraq and UAE governments, the \ninterests of the United States, U.S. Armed Forces, and those who cooperate and assist \nthe United States. Iraq, UAE, and the United States are allies in the war on terrorism.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence and \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n\n \n21   \n                                                                                                                                              \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \n \nWITHDRAWN \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline B:    \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 9, 2016. \nOn October 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline H. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 20, 2018, and requested a decision \non the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \n03/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment\u2019s written case on December 27, 2018. On December 28, 2018, a complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an \nopportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on January 3, 2019, and submitted a \nresponse, which was included in the record without objection by Department Counsel. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 12, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a, alleging that he used \nmarijuana with varying frequency from the fall of 2011 to at least July 2017. He denied \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, alleging that he intends to use marijuana in the future. His admission of \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old analyst employed by a federal contractor since August \n2015. He attended college from August 2010 to May 2015, received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree, and was hired by his current employer shortly thereafter. He has no military \nservice. He has never married and has no children. He has never held a security \nclearance. \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking if he \nhad illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years. When he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in August 2017, he told the investigator that \nhe wanted to change his answer to the question to \u201cyes.\u201d He told the investigator that he \nused marijuana once or twice a week during college, that he contributed money to buy \nmarijuana, and that he purchased it himself at least once. He told the investigator that \nhe stopped using marijuana in 2015, while looking for employment, and abstained for \nfour to six months after being hired by his current employer. After he became \ncomfortable in his job, he resumed his use of marijuana, smoking it once a month until \nJuly 2017, with a period of abstinence for four to six months in 2016. He admitted using \nmarijuana within 30 days of the interview. \n \nWhen asked about his future intentions, Applicant told the investigator that he \nhad no immediate plans to stop using marijuana and that he intended to move to a \njurisdiction where marijuana was legal. After being advised that marijuana use violates \nfederal law even when it is legal under local law, he told the investigator that he would \nstop using marijuana if he had to choose between using marijuana and holding a \nsecurity clearance. Finally, he told the investigator that he answered \u201cno\u201d to the drug-\nrelated questions in the SCA because he was trying to hide his marijuana use. (FORM \nItem 4 at 7-8.) \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he had abstained from \nmarijuana since his August 2017 interview. He stated that he had disassociated from \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 3) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \nthe \u201ccollegiate sort of crowd\u201d with whom he had used marijuana, and had established a \nnew network of work-related colleagues and acquaintances, including an employee \nsports group. He stated that his social circle now consists of other professionals \nincluding doctors and lawyers. He submitted a statement of intent to refrain from illegal \ndrug involvement and acknowledged that any future drug involvement would be grounds \nfor revoking a security clearance. He attached documentation of a urinalysis conducted \non January 23, 2019, which tested negative for marijuana as well as other controlled \nsubstances.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n\n \n4 \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24:  \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \n \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was recent, frequent, \nand did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement, and he appears to have abstained from marijuana use since his August \n2017 interview. He claims that he has disassociated from his marijuana-using collegiate \ngroup and has become involved in athletic and professional circles related to his \nemployment. He did not provide any corroborating evidence to support his claims. He \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from further drug involvement.  \n \n \nI am not satisfied that Applicant\u2019s assertions are credible. He admitted falsifying \nhis SCA to hide his drug involvement.2 During his security interview in August 2017, he \ndeclared his intention to continue using marijuana until the investigator made it clear \nthat marijuana use was an impediment to obtain a clearance. He then declared that he \nwould stop using marijuana if he had to choose between marijuana use and a security \nclearance. He appears to be willing to say whatever it takes to obtain a security \nclearance.  \n                                                          \n2 Falsification of the SCA was not alleged in the SOR. However, conduct not alleged in the SOR may be \nconsidered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is \napplicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider \nwhether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis. \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification of his SCA for these limited purposes. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003).  \n \n\u201cOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 \nF.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his drug involvement. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement  \nand Substance Misuse): \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n                                                          \n3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Based upon a review of the \nrecord as a whole, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nHistory of Case \n \nOn October 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 16, 2018 (Answer), and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on February 7, 2019. DOHA issued a Notice \nof Hearing on February 12, 2019, setting the hearing for February 26, 2019. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled.1 Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 \ninto evidence. Applicant testified, and called one witness. Applicant offered Exhibits (AE) \nA through D into evidence. All exhibits were admitted by stipulation of the parties. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 6, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nAt the commencement of the hearing, Department Counsel requested that I take \nadministrative notice of facts concerning Jordan, the West Bank, and Gaza, as set forth \nin Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice for Jordan, marked as Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) 1; and Applicant\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice for Israel: West Bank and Gaza, \nmarked as HE 2.2 Applicant did not object to these exhibits, and they were admitted. (Tr. \n13) The facts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. Those facts are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. She was born in Columbia. She attended high school \nand one year of college there. She immigrated to the United States in 1987 when she \nwas 21 years old. Upon her arrival, she studied English. She married her husband in \n1991. She became a U.S. citizen in 1993. She graduated from a U.S. university in 1994 \nwith a bachelor\u2019s degree. She earned a master\u2019s degree in 2008. She and her husband \nhave three daughters born in the United States. (Tr. 71-73, 47; GE 1) She is a dual citizen \nof Columbia. (Tr. 63) \n \n \nIn 1995, Applicant started her current position with a defense contractor. She has \nheld a security clearance since 1995. This is her second security clearance investigation. \n(Tr. 73, 79-80)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Colombia and lived there until they died. She has \nsix siblings (three brothers and three sisters), all of whom were born in Columbia and are \nnaturalized U.S. citizens residing in the United States. (GE 1, 2) After her parents died, \nApplicant and her siblings inherited their family home in Columbia. It is a four-flat building, \nworth about $150,000. One of her sisters, who is retired, stays in one flat when she visits \nColumbia. The other three flats are rented. The rental monies are used to maintain the \nbuilding. Applicant does not receive income from the property. (Tr. 85-88, 99)  \n \n                                            \n1 Applicant waived her right to have 15-days\u2019 notice of this hearing. (Tr. 9)  \n  \n2 Although the SOR raises security concerns related to Applicant\u2019s cousin and friend, who are citizens and \nresidents of Columbia, and Applicant\u2019s ownership of property there, the Government did not submit a \nRequest for Administrative Notice for Columbia, relating to a heightened risk assessment.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant has two living relatives who are citizens and residents of Columbia, an \nelderly aunt and a cousin. She periodically sends her aunt $100 for medicine. (Tr. 89) \nShe speaks to her cousin two or three times a year. That cousin manages the family\u2019s \napartment building in Columbia. Applicant also has a close friend from high school, who \nis a citizen and resident of Columbia, with whom she maintains contact. Applicant speaks \nto her high school girlfriend every month, and connects through the internet. She and her \ngirlfriend talk with other high school friends through online group chats. Applicant does \nnot discuss her employment with her relatives or friends. Applicant visited Columbia in \n1995 and in 2015, at which time she saw her girlfriend. (Tr. 101-105) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified. He is 49 years old. He was born in Iraq, while his \nfamily was working and living there. He and his family left Iraq when he was five years \nold and returned to their home in Jordan. He immigrated to the United States after high \nschool and subsequently attended a U.S. university. He became a U.S. naturalized citizen \nin 1998. (Tr. 21-22) He has worked for a state agency since 1991. (Tr. 17) He holds dual \ncitizenship with Jordan. (Tr. 52) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband had five siblings, four are living. One brother is a retired major \nwith the Palestinian Authority (PA), where he had worked as a police officer from 1996 to \n2018, while residing in Ramallah, West Bank. He no longer resides in Ramallah. He is a \nresident and citizen of Jordan. Applicant\u2019s husband speaks to him quarterly by telephone. \nHe saw him in June 2018, when Applicant\u2019s other brother had heart surgery in Jordan. \nThat brother is a citizen and resident of Jordan. He retired from a public works\u2019 position \nwith a Jordanian government department. (Tr. 43-44, 52-55, 61)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband\u2019s youngest sister works for a zoning department in Ramallah, \nthe city in which she and her husband live. She is a Jordanian citizen. Applicant\u2019s husband \nsaid he sends a couple hundred dollars a year to members of this sister\u2019s family as gifts. \n(Tr. 27-28) He has never discussed the security situation in the West Bank with this sister. \nHis oldest sister worked for a ministry of the Palestinian government in Ramallah. Since \nretiring in 2016, that sister moved back to Jordan where her children live.3 (Tr. 56-61) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband said he does not believe any of his siblings, who have lived \nin or traveled to the West Bank, have visited Gaza in the past 15 years during which it \nwas taken over by Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist organization. (Tr. 61; HE 1) His last \nvisit to Ramallah was in 2009, when his mother was there and became ill and died. (Tr. \n26) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband testified that his brother, the retired major, is aware that his \nwife is seeking a security clearance because he asked that brother for his certificate of \ntraining with the United States Security Coordinator when he worked for the PA. (AE D) \nHe said the other siblings do not know many details about Applicant\u2019s job and have not \n                                            \n3 The SOR did not allege a security concern regarding this sister-in-law. That fact will not be considered in \nanalyzing disqualifying conditions. It may be considered in analyzing mitigating conditions and the whole-\nperson concept.   \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ndiscussed it with him. (Tr. 62) Applicant\u2019s husband testified that he has no ties to the \nJordanian government or to the PA. (Tr. 48-49) He does not have plans to visit Jordan \nunless there is another medical emergency with a family member. (Tr. 64) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband and his four siblings inherited a three-floor building in Jordan \nupon his father\u2019s death. One of his brothers lives in it and manages the rental units. \nApplicant\u2019s husband said he does not receive any income from the rental proceeds. (Tr. \n30-32) The unit has an estimated value of $100,000. (Tr. 65) \n \n \nApplicant traveled to Jordan once in 1998, to meet her husband\u2019s family after they \nmarried. She and her husband stayed for two weeks. While there, she met her husband\u2019s \nsisters and brothers. She informed her employer of the trip prior to leaving. (Tr. 76-78, \n105) Applicant does not speak to her in-laws in Jordan or the West Bank. She said the \nlanguage barrier makes it difficult to communicate with one another. She has no plans to \nvisit Jordan the future. (Tr. 106) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband have assets in the United States. They own a home \nwhich has an estimated value of $300,000. (Tr. 89) She has about $300,000 in her \nretirement account. She and her husband are providing financial support to their daughter \nwho is attending college. The two younger daughters live at home. (Tr. 108; GE 1) She \nand her husband have no intention to move to Columbia or invest in the country. (Tr. 94) \n \n \nApplicant expressed her love for the United States. She said she and her husband \nhave no sympathies with any terrorist organization. They have no intention of moving or \nretiring to another country, such as Jordan. They intend to live in the United States. Her \nchildren have no intention of visiting Columbia or the Middle East. (Tr. 49, 94-96, 105, \n108) \n \n  \n  \nApplicant submitted her 2018-year-end performance review from her employer. \nHer supervisor gave her an over-all assessment as an \u201cexcellent performer.\u201d (AE C) \n \nJordan \n \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npronouncements concerning Jordan, as outlined in HE 1. Jordan is a small, Middle \nEastern country governed by a constitutional monarchy. Jordan has a pro-Western \nforeign policy, and has had close relations with the United States for more than forty \nyears. Torture, arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention, denial of due process, and \nrestrictions on freedom of speech are human rights problems in Jordan. Despite \naggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Jordan \nremains high. Terrorists in Jordan target U.S. interests to exploit and undermine U.S. \nnational security interests. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as \nstate intelligence services. The U.S. State Department issues travel advisories for U. S. \ncitizens traveling to Jordan.    \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n \nIsrael: West Bank and Gaza \n \n \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \npronouncements concerning the West Bank and Gaza, as outlined in HE 2. As a result of \nthe 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and \nEast Jerusalem. In 1994, the Palestinians established the Palestinian Authority (PA) in \nthe Gaza Strip and West Bank, whose purpose was to provide police and security for \ncivilians living in the areas. The PA lacked many of the powers and authorities of a full-\nfledged nation state. In June 2007, Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist organization, took \ncontrol of the Gaza Strip after a brief civil war. Hamas exerts significant control and \ninfluence in the West Bank, and generally among Palestinians, due to its popularity for its \nresistance to Israel. Several other groups operating in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza \nhave been designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) by the State \nDepartment. \n \nHamas engages in violent resistance to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and \nthe Gaza Strip. Hamas receives assistance from Iran, Syria, and the Lebanese Shiite \nmilitant group Hezbollah. Several other foreign terrorist organizations operate in the West \nBank and Gaza Strip. The State Department urges caution when traveling to the West \nBank. U.S. government personnel and their families are allowed only on specifically \nidentified routes, and all other personal travel in the West Bank, unless specifically \nauthorized for mission-approved purposes, is prohibited. U.S. citizens have been injured, \nkilled, or kidnapped by terrorists in the West Bank.  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n\n \n \n \n \n6\ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;4  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology;   \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a dual citizen of the United States and Jordan. She and her \nhusband reside together. Her two brothers-in-law are citizens and residents of Jordan. \nOne of those brothers-in-law worked as a police officer for the PA, located in the West \nBank, until he retired in 2016. One sister-in-law is a citizen and resident of the West Bank. \nApplicant\u2019s husband has ongoing familial connections with these siblings. He also has an \nownership interest with them in a piece of property in Jordan. These relationships create \na heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because terrorists and \ninsurgents in Jordan or the West Bank may seek intelligence or engage in behaviors that \nare hostile to the United States\u2019 interests and citizens. The relationships also create a \npotential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information \nor technology and her desire to help in-laws living in Jordan or the West Bank. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions as to allegations related \nto her husband, in-laws, and her husband\u2019s ownership of property in Jordan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \n7(b), 7(e), and 7(f) apply.  \n \nApplicant has maintained contact with her cousin and a girlfriend, who are citizens \nand residents of Columbia, since leaving that country. Applicant also has an ownership \ninterest, with her six siblings, in a piece of property in Columbia. Only AG \u00b6 7(b) applies \n                                            \n4 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, \ndisqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and \ncould potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nto the contacts she has with the two citizens of Columbia, because an issue of heightened \nrisk has not been raised with respect to Columbia. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e), and 7(f) do not apply. \n \n  \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns at issue in this case: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) has limited applicability. Applicant does not speak to her in-laws because \nof a language barrier. She has not been to Jordan since 1998. Applicant\u2019s husband, \nhowever, has ongoing contact with his four siblings, who reside in Jordan and the West \nBank. Because of those close connections, Applicant is not able to fully meet her burden \nof showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that the relationships between her husband and his \nsiblings could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) applies to Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts with her Colombian aunt and \ncousin that are alleged in the SOR. She credibly testified that her communications with \nthose relatives are minimal, occurring a couple times a year. AG \u00b6 8(c) applies minimally \nto her girlfriend, with whom she speaks on a monthly basis and interacts through a chat \nroom.    \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States.\u201d Applicant has \nestablished substantial connections to the United States. She left Columbia in 1987 and \nimmigrated to the United States. She became a U.S. citizen in 1993. She graduated from \n\n \n \n \n \n9\na U.S. university in 1994 and began working for her current employer in 1995. She has \nheld a security clearance since then, without incident. Her recent performance reviews \nreflect her excellent work. Her husband and children are U.S. citizens and residents. Her \nsiblings are U.S. citizens and residents. She and her husband have significant financial \nties in the United States that outweigh their inherited foreign real estate interests shared \nwith siblings. Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nThe evidence establishes mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(f), as to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. Applicant\u2019s husband has a shared ownership interest with three siblings in a piece of \nreal estate in Jordan that has an estimated value of $100,000 but provides no income to \nhim. Applicant and her husband own a home in the United States worth about $300,000. \nShe has about $300,000 in a retirement fund. They both hold secure long-term \nemployment in the United States. Her U.S. assets are far more significant than the shared \ninterest that her husband may realize if he and his siblings sold their family property.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s substantial, deep, and long-lasting connections to the United States \noutweigh any connections she has to Colombia, or to Jordan and the West Bank through \nher husband and in-laws. She presented sufficient evidence to fully overcome and \nmitigate all foreign influence security concerns under Guideline B. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The foreign influence security concerns \ndo not arise from any questionable conduct by Applicant, but rather circumstances that \nare the result of her husband\u2019s relationship with his siblings in the Middle East and her \nchildhood in Colombia. There is sufficient mitigating evidence weighing in favor of \n\n \n \n \n \n10 \ngranting Applicant a security clearance. Applicant is a mature person, who has lived in \nthe United States since 1987 and has been a citizen since 1993. She has successfully \nworked for the same defense contractor since 1995. Her husband has been a U.S. citizen \nsince 1998. They have three children who were born in the United States. All of \nApplicant\u2019s siblings are U.S. citizens. At this time, her connections to Jordan and the West \nBank are through her husband\u2019s four siblings, with whom she does not communicate. The \nlikelihood that any of those in-laws could pressure her, through her husband, to cause \npotential harm to the United States is minimal. Her long-distance connections to Columbia \nthrough two relatives and a girlfriend do not raise a security concern. Her financial interest \nin the family property in Columbia is minimal. Applicant has demonstrated her loyalty to \nthe United States through her many years of excellent work with the government \ncontractor.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts \nand circumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n   FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h:   \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 4, 2018, Applicant defaulted on five student loans that had been charged off for $41,561 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $38,828 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $35,254 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $29,535 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $7,889 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Additionally, Applicant owed on a credit-card account placed for collection for $4,141 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, she admitted owing the student loans, but indicated that she was repaying them at $100 a month since September 2017; that she intended to continue to make that payment for the next 11 months; and that she planned to increase her payment to $500 a month after her car is paid off in October 2019. She explained she was unable to meet the $1,200 monthly payment term on her student loans because she lacked full-time employment. As for the credit-card debt, she explained that her account was not currently delinquent, and she has established electronic repayments through November 2022. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 35-year-old administrative assistant with a defense contractor. She has never married, but she is engaged. She and her fianc\u00e9 have a five-year-old son. Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 began a cohabitant relationship in approximately October 2010.

Connelley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/20/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on her private student loans, which have accrued to \napproximately $190,000, and on a credit-card debt because of insufficient income. She has \nbeen repaying the student loans since February 2018 at $100 a month and the credit card \nat $50 per month since September 2017, but more progress is needed before I can \nconclude that her financial issues are sufficiently mitigated. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 4, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing a security \nconcern under Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations on November 6, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). Her case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On March 18, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for April 11, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted in evidence. An \nApril 2018 credit report (GE 4) was admitted over her expressed concerns about the \nmisspelling of her first name and old address information because there was sufficient \nindicia that it was her credit report. Two Applicant exhibits (AEs A-B) were admitted in \nevidence, and Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by \nDOHA on April 19, 2019. I received the transcript on April 30, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 4, 2018, Applicant defaulted \non five student loans that had been charged off for $41,561 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $38,828 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b), $35,254 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $29,535 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $7,889 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Additionally, \nApplicant owed on a credit-card account placed for collection for $4,141 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). When \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegations, she admitted owing the student loans, but \nindicated that she was repaying them at $100 a month since September 2017; that she \nintended to continue to make that payment for the next 11 months; and that she planned to \nincrease her payment to $500 a month after her car is paid off in October 2019. She \nexplained she was unable to meet the $1,200 monthly payment term on her student loans \nbecause she lacked full-time employment. As for the credit-card debt, she explained that \nher account was not currently delinquent, and she has established electronic repayments \nthrough November 2022. \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and hearing transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old administrative assistant with a defense contractor. She \nhas never married, but she is engaged. She and her fianc\u00e9 have a five-year-old son. \nApplicant and her fianc\u00e9 began a cohabitant relationship in approximately October 2010. \n(GEs 1-2; Tr. 48-49.) In late February 2019, Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 moved into a home \nthat he purchased from his brother. (Tr. 5, 49.) Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 has covered the rent and \nnow mortgage throughout their cohabitant relationship. Applicant\u2019s living expenses are \nreduced because she has not had to pay rent or contribute to the mortgage. (Tr. 48-49.) \n \nApplicant attended a private university in her home state from 2002 to 2006, when \nshe earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in teaching physical education. (GE 2; Tr. 31-32, 36.) \nShe paid for her education largely with student loans. Available account records (AE A) \n\n3 \n \nand credit reports (GEs 3-4) show that she obtained a combination of federal and private \nstudent loans totaling approximately $100,000.1 (AE A.) \n \nAfter college, Applicant worked as a leasing agent for a real estate company. She \nwas employed full time until January 2007 and then part time one day per week until May \n2007. In January 2007, Applicant began working full time on a contract basis as a medical \nrecords technician at a military health clinic while also attending a local community college. \nIn January 2009, Applicant withdrew from the community college and moved back to her \nhome state. She became employed in a contract position with a pharmaceutical company. \n(GEs 1-2.) Applicant or her father made consistent payments on her private student loans \nfrom October 2008 to February 2010. (GE 2; AE A.) \n \nIn approximately July 2010, Applicant returned to work at the military health clinic. \n(GEs 1-2.) Available student-loan payment records from the loan servicer reflect no \npayments on her student loans from April 2010 to December 2010, when $20,302 was \ncredited to her account. (AE A.) It is unclear what led to this credit entry. Total payments of \n$1,857 were credited to her account in 2011. (AE A.) \n \nIn November 2012, Applicant became unemployed. She moved in with her mother \nand stepfather. Her mother was ill and needed her care and assistance. Applicant collected \nunemployment compensation from approximately November 2012 to September 2013. \nAfter her son was born in July 2013, Applicant was primarily a stay-at-home mother. She \nworked part-time on the weekends as a unit secretary at a hospital from September 2013 \nuntil April 2015. From January 2015 to June 2017, Applicant drove a school bus 30 hours a \nweek at $14 an hour while school was in session. Her take-home pay was approximately \n$300 a week. During the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017, she was laid off and collected \nunemployment compensation of $150 to $190 per week. (GE 2; Tr. 27-28.) Her federal \nstudent loans were deferred when she was unemployed, although interest continued to \naccrue on the loans. (Tr. 40.) \n \nApplicant or her father made some of her student loan payments, including of $743 \nper month from September 2012 through November 2013 and $652 per month in 2014, \nalthough payments were sometimes late.2 (GE 2; AE A.) Payments on her private student \nloans were minimal after April 2015, and interest continued to accrue on the loans, which \nhad interest rates of 6.25% to 11.25% depending on the loan. Neither Applicant nor \napparently her father could afford the $1,200 to $1,300 a month then required on the loans, \nand the loan servicer was not willing to accept lower payments. (GE 2; Tr. 35.) In January \n2016 two of her private student loans were charged off for $41,516 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and \n                                                 \n1 Applicant testified that she obtained about $100,000 in student loans that have now accrued to approximately \n$190,000 due to interest and fees. (Tr. 45.) The account history with the loan servicer for both her private and \nfederal student loans lists disbursements of $9,399 in November 2004; $9,399 in January 2005; $4,900 in \nMarch 2005; $22,222 in October 2005; $18,000 in October 2005; $11,620 in February 2006; $4,800 in \nFebruary 2006; and $13,121 in November 2006. (AE A.) The private loans were to be repaid at $1,133 a \nmonth per the available credit information. (GE 4.) \n \n2 Applicant testified in part, \u201cThe bigger payments\u2014like the $652\u2014those type of payments\u2014those definitely \ncame from my dad helping me financially.\u201d (Tr. 44.) \n\n4 \n \n$38,828 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In February 2016, three more private student loans were charged off \nin the amounts of $35,254 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $29,535 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and $7,889 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \n(GE 3.) The loan servicer offered to settle her loans for a lump-sum payment of $75,000 \nthat she could not afford. (Tr. 30.) \n \nApplicant became seriously delinquent on a credit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.f) in late \n2015. Available credit reports show that she brought her account current in February 2016 \nbefore ceasing payment again in July 2016. In January 2017, Applicant\u2019s account was \nreferred for collection. As of April 2017, her account was $4,658 past due. (GE 3.) \n \nWith her son about to start full-day school, Applicant applied to work with a defense \ncontractor. (Tr. 28.) On March 25, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy \nof a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). She reported no issues of \npotential security concern, including no delinquencies involving routine accounts in the last \nseven years. (GE 1.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on May 16, 2017, revealed that she had defaulted on \nfive private student loans and on the credit card account. Applicant was making timely \npayments on a credit-card account with a balance of $5,904 and on an unsecured loan \nwith a $4,158 balance, although both accounts had been past due previously. She was \nmaking $405 monthly payments on a car loan obtained for $18,424 in June 2014 with a \ncurrent balance of $10,822. Her federal student loans were in deferment with a \nconsolidated balance of $15,169. (GE 3.) \n \nIn late August 2017, Applicant began working for the defense contractor at $17.69 \nan hour. (Tr. 28.) As an administrative assistant with an interim clearance in a secured \nbuilding, she worked on technical manuals containing both classified and unclassified \ninformation. (Tr. 37-38.) In September 2017, she began repaying her delinquent credit card \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) at $50 a month under a repayment arrangement that ends in November 2022. \n(AE B; Tr. 29, 42.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s charged-off private student loans were placed for collection with a \ncollection entity willing to accept what she could afford in repayment, and she began \nrepaying the loans at $100 a month in February 2018. As of April 2009, Applicant had \nmissed no payments, although her payments were late in May 2018 and August 2018. (AE \nA; Tr. 29, 40.) By then, the loans had been transferred back to the loan servicer, who \naccepted the repayment arrangement. Despite her consistent repayments since February \n2018, Applicant had made little to no progress in reducing the balance of her private \nstudent loans because of the interest rate on the loans. (Tr. 45.) \n \nOn July 3, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant volunteered that she had financial \ndelinquencies that should have been reported on her SF 86. She explained that she \nobtained student loans for her undergraduate education, and that she could not afford the \nmonthly repayment required. Her father made the payments for her until approximately \n2015, when he could no longer afford to do so. She advised the loan servicer that she \n\n5 \n \ncould not afford the payments. Sometime in early 2018, she arranged with a collection \nentity to make $100 monthly payments. Applicant expressed an intention to re-evaluate her \nfinances in October 2018 and see whether she could increase her monthly payment. She \nestimated her outstanding balance at $160,000 for five private student loans and indicated \nthat two other loans had been paid off previously. She expressed her belief that she had no \nother past-due debts. When confronted about the credit-card delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nApplicant stated that she had failed to recall the debt earlier, but it was being repaid at $50 \na month toward a current balance of $4,100. Applicant attributed her financial problems to \nunderemployment and unemployment. On July 3, 2018, Applicant was re-contacted by the \nOPM investigator. Applicant provided proof that she was making payments toward her \ndelinquent credit card and her private student loans. (GE 2.) \n \nAs of July 2018, Applicant reportedly owed $184,528 on her defaulted private \nstudent loans ($51,380 on SOR \u00b6 1.a; $48,001 on SOR \u00b6 1.b; $43,097 on SOR \u00b6 1.c; \n$33,185 on SOR \u00b6 1.d; and $8,865 on SOR \u00b6 1.e). The balance on her delinquent credit \ncard in SOR \u00b6 1.f was $4,141. She had no other past-due debts on her credit record. She \nowed $5,907 on her $18,424 car loan; $16,106 in federal student-loan debt; $5,374 on a \ncredit-card account closed by the credit grantor; and $3,598 on an unsecured loan. Those \naccounts were rated as current. (GE 4.) \n \nApplicant began repaying her federal student-loan debt at $65 a month in November \n2018, after she was contacted about her ability to commence repayment. (Tr. 40-41.) She \nhas remained current on her federal loans since then. (AE A.) She recently received an \noffer to settle her federal student-loan debt of approximately $16,000 for $10,000 payable \nat $250 a month for five months followed by $85 a month until the $10,000 is paid. After \nsome consideration, she elected not to accept the offer because of the tax implications in \nthat she would have to report cancelled debt as income on her tax returns. (Tr. 47.) \n \n \nOn October 4, 2018, Applicant was issued an SOR because of her large private \nstudent-loan delinquencies and her credit-card debt in collection. Her employer moved her \nto a non-secure building and gave her unclassified work handling correspondence. (Tr. 31, \n37-38.) She does not need a security clearance for those duties but advancement \nprospects within the company are limited without a clearance. (Tr. 37.) \n \n \nApplicant received a $4,000 income tax refund for tax year 2018 in 2019. She saved \n$1,000 of her refund for a summer vacation. She paid down her car loan to a balance of \n$1,700 as of April 2019, and also purchased items for her new home. (Tr. 30, 42-43.) \nBased on her required monthly payment, Applicant\u2019s car loan will be paid off in October \n2019. She hopes to satisfy her car loan by mid-July 2019, which would free up about $400 \na month. She plans to put the funds toward her credit-card and student-loan delinquencies \n\u201cto try and get ahead of the interest\u201d on her private student loans. (Tr. 29, 33-34, 46.) As of \nApril 2019, her private student-loan debt had accrued to approximately $190,000. (Tr. 45.) \nIn hindsight, she regrets taking on such sizeable student-loan debt because of the financial \nburden. (Tr. 32.) \n  \n\n6 \n \nApplicant had credit counseling six or seven years ago. (Tr. 47.) Her fianc\u00e9\u2019s \nmortgage on their home is being repaid at $993 a month. He had been paying $1,200 a \nmonth in rent before he bought their home. (Tr. 49.) Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 was self-employed \nfor about five years, during which time they \u201cwere scraping by.\u201d He returned to work a year \nago. (Tr. 49.) The record contains no information about his employment or income.  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage her finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on her private student loans that she obtained for her \nundergraduate education at a private university. Five private student loans totaling \n$153,067 were charged off in early 2016. By July 2018, the aggregate delinquency had \naccrued to $184,528. Additionally, Applicant owed $4,141 on a credit-card account in \ncollection. Applicant\u2019s record of delinquent accounts triggers disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for her financial \njudgment raised by her delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nFour of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some consideration and could potentially \napply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n8 \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the student loans in the SOR became seriously past due in \n2015. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at \n2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Available credit information shows that she rehabilitated her \ncredit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.f in February 2016 only to default again in the summer of \n2016. Despite efforts to address her credit-card and private student-loan delinquencies \nsince she started working for a defense contractor in late August 2017, it is difficult to apply \nAG \u00b6 20(a). Because of the interest rates on unpaid balances, her private student-loan \ndebts now total approximately $190,000. There is no evidence that her private student \nloans have been rehabilitated from default, but the loan servicer creditor is currently \naccepting payments. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant lacked the income to make the $1,133 required \neach month to remain current on her private student loans. She became unemployed and \nmoved home to care for her ill mother in November 2012, although at that time, her father \nhelped her financially by making some student-loan payments for her. Her student-loan \ndefault in 2015 was not entirely outside of her control because it was her choice to be \nprimarily a stay-at-home mother while her son was young. It is unclear whether she would \nhave been successful landing a job that provided income sufficient to cover daycare as well \nas her monthly student-loan payments, but there is no evidence that she made a concerted \neffort to find full-time employment before 2017. Little information was presented about her \nexpenses. She testified that she and her fianc\u00e9 were scraping by.  \n \n \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to \ncircumstances outside of her control, I have to consider whether Applicant acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with her financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. \nMay 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant maintained \ncontact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep debts \ncurrent. Applicant asserts that she informed the loan servicer for her private student loans \nthat she could not meet the repayment terms, but the company would not accept partial \npayments. There is no evidence that she kept in contact with the bank identified in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f to possibly avoid that credit-card debt going to collections. \n \n\n9 \n \n \nApplicant began repaying the credit-card delinquency at $50 a month in September \n2017 and the private student loans at $100 a month in February 2018 while were in \ncollections. Her consistent monthly payments since then show some good faith under AG \u00b6 \n20(d). Yet, it is difficult to conclude that her financial situation is sufficiently under control \nunder AG \u00b6 20(c), given the minimal progress shown toward reducing the debt balances. \nShe testified that her $100 monthly payments do not even cover the interest on her private \nstudent-loan debts that have accrued to approximately $190,000.3 She used some of her \n$4,000 income tax refund for tax year 2018 to reduce the balance remaining on her car \nloan, and she intends to increase her monthly repayment of her private student loans by \n$400 a month when her car loan is paid off in a few months. Nonetheless, her student loan \ndebts are a financial burden that is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. \n \n Whole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nLike many students of her generation, Applicant took on large student loans for her \ncollege education expecting to land a job at some future date that would provide the \nincome needed to repay them. After her son was born in July 2013, she worked part time \nuntil she began her current employment in August 2017. Her decision to be primarily a \nstay-at-home mother was understandable in some aspects, but it also had negative \nconsequences in that the balance of her private student loans is now almost double that \nborrowed for her education. \n \nApplicant began addressing her SOR debts after she applied for a security \nclearance but well before the SOR was issued. She is not required, as a matter of law, to \nestablish that she has paid off every debt in the SOR. She is required to demonstrate that \nshe has established a plan to resolve her financial problems and taken significant actions \nto implement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Applicant\u2019s creditors have accepted her \n$50 and $100 monthly payments. She has a track record of more than a year of payments, \nbut she also incurred late fees in May 2018 and August 2018 on her student-loan account. \nShe did not offer an explanation for the late payments to rebut inferences of financial \nirresponsibility or alternatively a tenuous financial situation. Applicant and her fianc\u00e9 have \nreduced their monthly expenses somewhat in that his mortgage payment is less than his \nprevious rent. She should be in a position to increase her monthly student-loan payments \nsubstantially once her car loan is paid off in a few months, but it remains to be seen. She \nprovided little information about her monthly expenses apart from her car loan. \n \n \n                                                 \n3 The $100 payments have been applied to interest on her account. (AE A.) \n \n\n10 \n \nIn exceptional cases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility \nfor a security clearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated.4 Applicant testified credibly to a willingness to repay her debts. Yet, \nat even $500 a month, it will take her more than 30 years to pay off her student loans.  \nWhile this alone does not disqualify her from an exception under Appendix C, I have to \nconsider that the larger student loan payments of the past were made by her father for her \nand not by Applicant herself. Her late $100 payments for May and August 2018 cast some \ndoubt about her current finances, and she has other obligations that may take priority, \nincluding the credit card and unsecured loan debts on which she owed $8,972 in July 2018. \nA longer track record of consistent, timely payments is needed before I can confidently \nconclude that her financial situation no longer presents a security risk. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a security \nclearance in the future. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nevidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

DOHA assigned the case to me 26 \nFebruary 2019 and I convened a hearing 18 March 2019. DOHA received the transcript \n26 March 2019. \n1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.

She is a 52-year-old technical program manager \nemployed by a defense contractor since March 2015. She was unemployed from \nOctober 2014 to March 2015, and from October 2009 to November 2011 (GE 1). She \nclaims to have previously held a clearance, but was unable to provide any dates. \nThe SOR alleges, and GE 1-4 substantiate, 14 delinquent debts totaling over \n$97,000. Applicant admits nine debts totaling over $94,000. She also admits filing for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection in January 2011, with a discharge of her eligible debts \nin May 2011. She disclosed the bankruptcy petition on her September 2016 clearance \napplication (GE 1). The debts comprise a $23,000 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax \nlien (SOR 1.a), two delinquent education loans totaling over $60,000 (SOR 1.b-1.c)), \ntwo delinquent vehicle loans (SOR 1.e-1.f), and nine delinquent consumer accounts \n(SOR 1.g-1.o). Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits show that on 4 April 2019, she entered \na debt management program not otherwise detailed (AE A). On 5 April 2019, she \nauthorized full payment on SOR debt 1.o (AE B). She did not otherwise document any \nof the claimed payment arrangements or payments asserted during her hearing. \nApplicant attributed her 2011 bankruptcy to her ongoing unemployment. Her \n2014-2015 unemployment led to additional financial problems, as did some periods of \nunderemployment after 2015. She claimed to be making regular payments to the IRS, \nbut did not document any payment arrangement or payments. She claimed to have paid \nSOR debt 1.k, but again, did not document the payment. She had not taken any action \nto address the remainder of her debts. Applicant works a full-time job and a part-time \njob, and her husband works full time as well. Their combined monthly take-home pay is \nabout $13,000. They have $400-500 positive monthly cash flow (Tr. 47-51). \nApplicant received the financial counseling required by her 2011 bankruptcy, but \nhas not otherwise received credit or financial counseling (Tr. 54). The pastor of her \ncurrent church, a former supervisor, and a former user-agency representative gave \nApplicant favorable references. However, none of them noted any awareness of her \nfinancial issues (AE A). Her work performance was recently praised by her superiors \nand the user agency (AE C). \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.3 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s 2009-2011 unemployment \nled her to file for bankruptcy protection, and the ensuing discharge gave her a new start. \nNevertheless, she continued to experience financial problems, which were only partially \ncaused by her 2014-2015 unemployment. Moreover, she appears to have undertaken \nlittle action to address her delinquent debts, and has not documented what little action \nshe has claimed.4 \nApplicant only partially meets the mitigating factors for financial considerations. \nHer financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and have not ended; so they \ncannot be considered unlikely to recur. 5 Her initial financial problems were due to \ncircumstances beyond her control, and her later financial problems were at least partly \ndue to a short period of unemployment. However, she cannot be said to have dealt \nresponsibly with her delinquent debts. She has few claimed, and no documented, \nactions to address her delinquent debts. The recent payment of SOR debt 1.o and entry \ninto a debt management program\u2014not otherwise detailed\u2014were undertaken only after \nher hearing.6 \n3See, Department of the Navy v.

Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic \nplan to resolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant actions to implement \nthe plan. 9 Applicant has demonstrated neither plan nor action. Moreover, her \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d evidence is inadequate to support a \u201cwhole-person\u201d analysis arguing for \ngranting her clearance notwithstanding her financial issues.

She provided sufficient evidence \nshowing her actions to pay or otherwise resolve the delinquent obligations listed in the \nStatement of Reasons (SOR). Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, financial considerations, under which it was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for her.  \n \nThe DoD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \namended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 30, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). (SOR Response) On March 21, 2019, DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing \nscheduling a hearing that was conducted on April 10, 2019.  \n \nSix Government exhibits (Ex. 1 \u2013 6) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A \u2013 C) were \nadmitted into evidence without objection at the hearing. The record was held open \nfollowing the hearing to allow Applicant to submit additional documentation. On May 2, \n2019, eight additional documents were received and admitted into evidence without \nobjection as Ex. D \u2013 K. Applicant and her cohabitant testified, as reflected in a transcript \n(Tr.) received on April 19, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the delinquent obligations set forth \nin the SOR and indicated she was establishing repayment plans with her creditors. After \na thorough review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings \nof fact.  \nApplicant is a 45-year-old over-the-road truck driver who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since May 2017 and seeks to obtain a security clearance. Her income is \ndependent on the number of loads she hauls. (Tr. 28) Her income last year was between \n$35,000 and $40,000, which included $628 monthly from her ex-husband\u2019s military \nretirement. (Tr. 35, 40. 61) From August 1993 thought September 1994, she honorably \nserved in the U.S. Air Force. (Tr. 65) In 1993, she had been granted a secret security \nclearance. She left the Air Force in 1994 due to her pregnancy. (Tr. 65) She has two \ndaughters ages 24 and 21. (Ex. 1, Tr. 32) In April 2010, she was divorced having \nseparated from her ex-husband in 2008. (Tr. 22)  \nApplicant\u2019s current partner is also an over-the-road truck driver who holds a DoD \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. 68) Applicant and her partner both have their Transportation \nSecurity Administration (TSA) clearance. (Tr. 72) Applicant and her partner hope to save \n$30,000 over the next five years in order to purchase their own truck. (Tr. 73)  \n \nFollowing her divorce, Applicant lived with a girlfriend who caused serious financial \nproblems. Applicant was the only one working and had difficulty controlling her friend\u2019s \nspending. (Tr. 25) Applicant was an assistant store manager making ten dollars per hour. \n(Tr. 26) In September 2013, the relationship with the friend ended. (Tr. 25) From April \n2014 through January 2016, Applicant was unemployed. (Ex. 1, Tr. 77) She has lived with \nher cohabitant since January 2014. (Ex. 1) \n \nOn Applicant\u2019s September 2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), she indicated she had filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection in \n2012. (Ex. 1, Ex. D) She had been unemployed from March 2011 through October 2011. \n\n \n3 \n(Ex. 1, Tr. 77) The bankruptcy listed assets of $40,585 and liabilities of $78,884. (Ex. 1, \nEx. 3) A mobile home/trailer was surrendered during the bankruptcy and her debt was \ndischarged in the bankruptcy proceedings. (Ex. 2) She did not list any financial \ndelinquencies on routine accounts on her e-QIP, other than the bankruptcy.  \n \nThe SOR lists 13 past due, charged-off, or collection accounts totaling $33,483. \nFour of the debts totaling $14,147 were for student loans. (Tr. 46) Applicant\u2019s student loan \nobligations represents 42 percent of her total delinquent obligations. Applicant has \ncontacted 11 of the 13 creditors and set up payment arrangements or, in some cases, \nhas paid off the debts. (Tr. 12) She intends to pay all of her delinquent accounts. (Tr. 12) \nShe contacted the creditor for a $609 medical debt (SOR \u00b6 1.n) and was told the account \ncould no longer be found. (Tr. 55) She is continuing to pursue this obligation. (Tr. 55) The \nother creditor she has been unable to reach was the holder of the vehicle debt (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). (Tr. 55, 60)  \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2018 Enhanced Subject Interview, she indicated she was \nunemployed from March 2014 through January 2016. (Ex. 2) Following her divorce, she \nlived with a girlfriend who contributed to Applicant\u2019s financial problems leading to the \nbankruptcy. Applicant\u2019s credit score was almost 800 before this girlfriend caused her \nfinancial difficulties. (Ex. 2) Applicant had two car payments, but could not afford to pay \nboth of them after she became unemployed. In late 2012 or early 2013, she had \npurchased a $17,000 vehicle. (Tr. 58) In 2015, one vehicle was voluntarily repossessed \nresulting in a $16,536 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) being charged off in September 2015. (Ex. 2) As \nof June 2018, the balance on the debt was $14,165. (Ex. 5, Ex. 6) It took the creditor over \na year to repossess the car after being told to come and get it. (Ex. 2) She is continuing \nin her efforts to reach the creditor. (Tr. 59)  \n \nThe $549 credit card collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.g) was a credit card account \nopened after the bankruptcy. (Ex. 2, Ex. 4, Ex. 6) Applicant entered into a repayment with \nthe collection agency to make $25 monthly payments on the debt. (Tr. 52) She has made \nher required payments from March 2019 through September 2019. (Ex. A, Ex. I, Ex. J)  \n \nApplicant attended a university for four semesters in 2015 and 2016. She obtained \nfour student loans, one each for the four semesters. Two of the loans (SOR \u00b6 1.c, $6,868 \nand SOR \u00b6 1.d, $6,629) have been placed for collection. (Ex. 4, Ex. 5, Ex. 6) Her other \ntwo loans were $322 (SOR \u00b6 1.k with a $3,500 balance) and $328 (SOR \u00b6 1.l with a \nbalance of $3,500) are 120 days or more past due. (Ex. 4, Ex. 5) In November 2018, she \nentered into a rehabilitation plan with the U.S. Department of Education whereby she \nwould make $5 monthly payments, an amount calculated on her income. (Ex. E, Tr. 43, \nTr. 47) From November 2018 through September 2019, she made her monthly payments \nas required. (Ex. A, Ex. I, Ex. J) She has requested to continue payments by automatic \nwithdrawal from her bank account starting in November 2019, which will put her on a \nregular payment plan. (Ex. I, Tr. 20) Applicant intends to give priority to resolving her other \ndebts before significantly increasing her student loan payments. (Ex. 2) \n \n\n \n4 \nFollowing her divorce, Applicant did not have health insurance and when she \nobtained a job, her health insurance did not cover the entire cost of medical treatment. \nShe underwent gall bladder surgery and had a separate treatment for a broken foot. (Tr. \n77, 78) She has two medical collection accounts of $618 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) and $609 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.n). She also is delinquent on a third medical account of $469 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Ex. 4, Ex. \n5, Tr. 42) She has a repayment agreement on the third account whereby she pays $78 \nmonthly since March 2019. (Tr. 49) In October 2018, Applicant entered into a repayment \nagreement with the holder of the $618 medical debt to pay $51.56 monthly on the debt. \n(Ex. A, Ex. B, Ex. H, Ex. I, Ex. J, Tr. 53) She honored the agreement and paid off the debt \nin August 2019. (Ex. I)  \n \nThe $249 charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.j) for a utility bill was paid in full in March \n2019. (Ex. C, Tr. 53) The $802 collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.e) was a credit card account. \n(Ex. 2, Ex. 4, Ex. 5) In November 2018, the creditor offered to settle the debt for $401, \nwhich Applicant accepted and paid. (Ex. H, I, Tr. 60)  \n \nApplicant owed a collection agency $1,468 (SOR \u00b6 1.m) for a telecommunications \ndebt. (Ex. 4) In March 2019, she made a repayment agreement with the creditor to pay \n$118 monthly for 11 months. (Ex. G, Tr. 50) Starting in March 2019, she made her monthly \npayments on the debt. (Ex. A, Ex. H, Ex. I, Ex. J) As of August 2019, she owed only one \nmore payment on a balance of $118. (Ex. I) A collection agency was attempting to collect \n$407 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) for a credit card. (Ex. 2, Ex. 4, Ex. 6) In March 2019, she entered into a \nrepayment agreement with the creditor to pay $89 monthly for three months. (Ex. F, Tr. \n52, 54) In April 2019, May 2019 and June 2019, she honored the repayment agreement \nby making the $89 monthly payments on the debt. (Ex. A, Ex. H)  \n  \n Applicant is current on her $450 monthly rent, her $392 monthly loan payments \non her 2008 vehicle, and the $628 monthly payments on a 2011 motorcycle. (Tr. 36-37, \n83) She can afford her monthly obligations. (Tr. 39) Applicant asserts she has matured \nand thinks more about the future. (Tr. 62) Her children are now older and less dependent \non her for financial support. (Tr. 82)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe adjudication process is an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weight of a \n\n \n5 \nnumber of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the \nindividual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination of the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n\n \n6 \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n  \nThe record having established disqualifying conditions, additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions is required. Applicant has the burden of \nestablishing that matters in mitigation apply. Five financial considerations mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n\n \n7 \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant purchased a vehicle in 2012 and voluntarily surrendered it. She was \nunable to make the monthly payments. It was over a year before the creditor came to \ncollect the vehicle after Applicant informed them to come and get it. Once the vehicle was \nrepossessed and resold, Applicant owed $14,165. She has attempted to reach the \ncreditor to establish a settlement of this debt. This debt and a $609 medical debt are the \nonly two obligations Applicant has yet to address.  \n \nFollowing her divorce, she lived with a girlfriend who caused her serious financial \nproblems. In 2013, the relationship with the friend ended. (Tr. 25) From April 2014 through \nJanuary 2016, Applicant was unemployed. (Ex. 1, Tr. 77) She has lived with her current \npartner since January 2014. (Ex. 1) \n \nSeven years ago, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection partly \nbecause of her unemployed from March 2011 through October 2011 and partly due to the \nspending habits of her then cohabitant girlfriend. She earned only $10 per hour and had \ndifficulty controlling her friend\u2019s spending. The bankruptcy listed assets of $40,585 and \nliabilities of $78,884. She surrendered a mobile home/trailer during the bankruptcy. The \nbankruptcy is security significant because it shows that Applicant has had financial issues \nfor some time, but does not directly impact on Applicant\u2019s current financial condition, given \nthat her debts covered by the bankruptcy were discharged.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies because the debts were incurred some time ago and Applicant \nhas acted reasonably by making payments on 11 of the 13 SOR obligations. AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies because Applicant experienced periods of unemployment from March 2011 \nthrough October 2011 and April 2014 through January 2016. More importantly, she has \nkept in contact with her creditors and has made payments on the majority of her \ndelinquent obligations. This shows that she has acted responsibility under the \ncircumstances. \n \nAn applicant is not required to establish that she has paid each of the delinquent \ndebts in the SOR. However, an applicant needs to show that she has a plan to resolve \nher debts and that she has taken significant steps to implement her plan. This she has \ndone. Having addressed the majority of her debts by making monthly payments, I believe \nshe will reach settlement agreements with the two creditors lacking current repayment \nplans and honor those agreements. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not completely apply because there is no evidence of financial \ncounseling, but there are clear indications that her financial problems are being resolved \nand are under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies because she was able to initiate and adhere to \ngood-faith efforts to address her delinquent debts. While acknowledging that Applicant \nhas yet to arrange for repayment of her largest delinquency (the delinquent vehicle loan \n\n \n8 \nfor $14,165), that debt is not likely to be source of pressure or coercion for her while she \ncontinues to try and reach the creditor. It has been charged off and there is no indication \nthat the creditor is currently pursuing her for payment. Her current debt obligations are \nbeing paid on time. Under all of these circumstances, Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsideration security concerns. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. The comments under Guideline F are incorporated in the whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n \nA security clearance adjudication is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. It is not a debt-collection procedure. Applicant provided \nextensive evidence of payments, payment plans, or other actions to resolve the \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. She has maintained contact with her creditors. Her \nactions show financial responsibility. Questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information have been mitigated. The record shows good \njudgment and a willingness to comply with rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nThe law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, have \nbeen carefully applied to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. \nThe issue is not simply whether all the delinquent obligations have been paid\u2014the \nmajority of her delinquent obligations are being addressed\u2014it is whether Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial circumstances raise concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. \n(See AG & 2(c)) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \n\n \n9 \nher eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20141.n:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

White, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/17/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated foreign influence security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on December 12, 2016. On \nOctober 24, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) implemented by the DOD \non June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR, and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on February 27, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on \nMarch 28, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the file, and identified as \n\n \n2 \n \nItems 1 through 5, was admitted without objection.  Applicant did not respond to the \nFORM.  I was assigned the case on June 6, 2019.  \n \n                                      Procedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about South Korea. The request and the attached source documents \nwere not admitted into evidence but were included in the record. All of the documents \nreferenced in the Request for Administrative Notice and the facts asserted therein, are \nfrom open sources and are dated. South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea, is a \nself-governing state located in the southern part of the peninsula of Korea. The United \nStates and South Korea share a long history of friendship and cooperation based on \nshared values and interests. The two countries work together to combat regional and \nglobal threats and to strengthen their economies. South Korea is now the United State\u2019s \nsixth largest trading partner with a trillion-dollar economy. The longstanding relationship \nhas brought positive rewards to the U.S. economy including more job opportunities for \nAmericans. \n \nSouth Korea is one of the seven countries most actively engaged in foreign \neconomic collection and industrial espionage against the United States. Although South \nKorea is considered an ally, it has been the unauthorized recipient of technology \ncontrolled under U.S. export control laws, including material that could be used in \nmissile delivery/reentry systems, encryption software, optics and prism data and \ninfrared detectors and camera engines. Industrial espionage remains a high profile \nconcern relating to South Korea and South Korean companies. In July 2014, a South \nKorean chemical company agreed to pay a criminal penalty of over two million dollars to \nresolve an investigation into the company\u2019s attempted theft of a U.S. company\u2019s trade \nsecrets regarding a meta-aramid fiber used in protective fabrics, electrical insulation, \nand lightweight structural support for aircraft. Sources have also reported that South \nKorea may have attempted to compromise protected technology of U.S. F-15 fighters \nthat it purchased. (Item 5) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged  under Guideline B that (1.a) that Applicant\u2019s grandmother is a \ncitizen and resident of South Korea; (1.b) that he owns a home in South Korea with an \napproximate value of $270,000; (1.c) that he maintains a bank account in South Korea \nwith an approximate value of $15,000; and (1.d) that Applicant maintains contact with \ntwo friends who are citizens and residents of South Korea, both of whom have \ncompleted or are currently serving mandatory service in the South Korean military. \nApplicant admitted all the allegations, but noted that the bank account has been \ntransferred to his father\u2019s account in South Korea. (Item 1, 2) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n Applicant is a 31-year-old, who was born in the United States to South Korean \nparents. He lived in South Korea prior to the age of 12. (Item 4) At the age of 15, he \nrenounced his South Korean citizenship at the advice of his father so that he could \navoid the mandatory military requirement in South Korea. (Item 3) He attended a \nuniversity in South Korea in 2009 as an exchange student. (Item 3) He attended high \nschool in the United States. Applicant obtained an undergraduate degree from an \nAmerican university in May 2010. He received his master\u2019s degree from another \nAmerican university in 2016. \n \n \n Applicant was married in late 2016 to a citizen of South Korea and is sponsoring \nher for a green card. (Item 4) She lives with Applicant. From September 2011 until \nSeptember 2012, he resided in South Korea. Applicant noted on his 2016 security \nclearance application that he worked in South Korea from about 2010 until 2013. One \nemployer was an IT company. (Item 3) His last reported visit to South Korea was in \n2017. Applicant is not employed but is sponsored for a security clearance by a defense \ncontractor. He is taking courses for a certification in cyber security.   \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother is 90 years old and has never worked outside the home.  \nThere is no information in the file concerning contact with Applicant\u2019s grandmother. \n \n \nApplicant owns a home in South Korea valued at about $270,000. He stated in \nhis interview that he has owned the home since 2012. He also noted that it was a gift, \nbut he maintains ownership of it and rents the home. He does not own any other \nproperty in South Korea. He does not know if he will keep the property in his name. \n(Item 4) \n \n \nThe bank account in South Korea was closed after his investigative interview. \nThe money was transferred to his father\u2019s account in South Korea. (Item 4) He opened \nthe account in 2010, when he lived in South Korea. The amount in the account in 2012 \nwas $27,184. However, in the 2018 investigative interview, Applicant stated that he \nintended to close the account, but he had to physically be in South Korea to do so. \nApplicant also stated that perhaps his father could close the account on his next trip to \nSouth Korea.  \n \n \nApplicant maintains contact with two friends in South Korea .He explained during \nhis investigative interview that he participates in an electronic chat with the two friends \nhe met while living or studying in South Korea. He has several foreign national friends in \nthe chat group, and has had weekly or daily contact with them. One friend is a South \nKorean citizen but lives in the United States. Applicant keeps in touch with another \nSouth Korean citizen who lives in Australia. He has daily to weekly electronic contact \nwith him. (Item 4) The friends served mandatory service in the Korean military. \nApplicant feels allied with South Korea since he lived there as a child. (Item 4) \n \n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM to provide any additional information.  \nApplicant expressed he has loyalty to the United States, he clearly stated that he will \ncontinue to have contact with his foreign national friends.  (Item 4)  Also, he has \nproperty in South Korea and provided no information that would mitigate the \n\n \n4 \n \nimportance. He is unemployed and lives with his family. Thus, financial interests cannot \nbe weighed because he did not sufficiently explain his future intentions concerning the \nproperty. In addition, he is now married to a South Korean citizen. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s grandmother and various friends are citizens and residents of South \nKorea. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts may create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, both directly and through his family members. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been \nraised by the evidence. In addition, Applicant has property in South Korea. He provided \n\n \n6 \n \nno information about his own finances, except that he is unemployed. AG 7(f) raises \nanother security concern due to financial interests. \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States ;  \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation;  \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \nf) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.1  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \n                                                          \n1 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in the United States and renounced his South Korean \ncitizenship. However, his grandmother still lives in South Korea. There is no information \nas to the contact, but family ties are presumed. He noted in his interview that he feels  \nallied with South Korea since he lived there as a child. He now has a wife from South \nKorea who he is sponsoring for a green card. He provided no updated information in \nresponse to the FORM. He still maintains property in South Korea. He has worked in \nSouth Korea for an IT company. He maintains his group chats with his friends in South \nKorea. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n  \n.   \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B and in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \n\n \n8 \n \nwere addressed under those guidelines. Applicant has not provided sufficient \ninformation to meet his burden of proof. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nAGAINST Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 50 years old. He has been married to his wife since 2012, and they have two young children. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2002, a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003, and he attended some courses toward a master\u2019s degree. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy from 1988 until 1998, when he was honorably discharged. Applicant has worked for his current employer overseas in Kuwait as a force protection officer since September 2017. He held a top secret clearance while he was in the U.S. Navy, but has not held a clearance since approximately 1998. (GE 1; Tr. 12-15, 22-23) Applicant worked overseas as a defense contractor from 2009 until May 2013, when he was let go by his employer because he did not have a security clearance. He remained unemployed until May 2014. (Tr. 14-15, 27-28, 30) From May 2014 until September 2017, Applicant was underemployed and did not earn sufficient income to cover his expenses. Additionally, his wife was unemployed for a period of time. (Tr. 26, 30-33, 57) Applicant took the job overseas, in part, to resolve his delinquent debts. (Tr. 27) Applicant has 12 unresolved SOR debts, totaling $32,800, and he resolved 7 SOR debts, totaling $17,762. SOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off in 2014, and the outstanding balance is $16,889. Applicant testified that he has been making monthly payments of $66 since November 2018; however, he did not provide documentation to support his claims. (GE 2 at 9; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 35-36",

National \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nHistory of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 5, 2017. On \nOctober 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. Applicant \nanswered the SOR on November 13, 2018, and requested a hearing. \n \nI was assigned to the case on January 30, 2019. On April 1, 2019, I issued an \norder to both parties to produce their documentary evidence by April 29, 2019. On April \n8, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for May 14, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted, without objection. \nApplicant testified, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through F were admitted, without \nobjection. The record was held open until June 14, 2019, to allow Applicant to submit \nadditional documentation, which is admitted as AE G through I, without objection. I \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on May 29, 2019, and the record is closed. \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 50 years old. He has been married to his wife since 2012, and they \nhave two young children. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2002, a bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2003, and he attended some courses toward a master\u2019s degree. Applicant served in \nthe U.S. Navy from 1988 until 1998, when he was honorably discharged. Applicant has \nworked for his current employer overseas in Kuwait as a force protection officer since \nSeptember 2017. He held a top secret clearance while he was in the U.S. Navy, but has \nnot held a clearance since approximately 1998. (GE 1; Tr. 12-15, 22-23) \n \nApplicant worked overseas as a defense contractor from 2009 until May 2013, \nwhen he was let go by his employer because he did not have a security clearance. He \nremained unemployed until May 2014. (Tr. 14-15, 27-28, 30) From May 2014 until \nSeptember 2017, Applicant was underemployed and did not earn sufficient income to \ncover his expenses. Additionally, his wife was unemployed for a period of time. (Tr. 26, \n30-33, 57) Applicant took the job overseas, in part, to resolve his delinquent debts. (Tr. \n27) Applicant has 12 unresolved SOR debts, totaling $32,800, and he resolved 7 SOR \ndebts, totaling $17,762. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off in 2014, and the outstanding \nbalance is $16,889. Applicant testified that he has been making monthly payments of $66 \nsince November 2018; however, he did not provide documentation to support his claims. \n(GE 2 at 9; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 35-36, 39, 60) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a personal loan opened in 2013 and charged off in 2014 for $9,933. \nApplicant settled this debt in May 2019, shortly before the hearing. (GE 2 at 13; GE 3 at \n2; GE 4 at 4; AE A; Tr. 40-42) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a credit-card account that was opened in 2011 and charged off in \n2014 for $3,245. Applicant settled this debt in May 2019, shortly before the hearing. (GE \n2 at 13; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5; AE B; Tr. 42-43) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.h remain outstanding and unpaid. Applicant testified that he \nwas planning to try to resolve several of these debts before the record closed, but did not \nprovide documentation of payment or settlement. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; Tr. 44-50, 61) \n \n \nApplicant paid and resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j in May 2019. (AE C; AE G; Tr. 50-\n51)  \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant claimed he paid and resolved SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, 1.o, 1.q, \nand 1.r, but he did not provide documentation to substantiate his claims. (Tr. 51-55, 58-\n59) \n \n \nApplicant settled SOR \u00b6 1.m in May 2019. He paid SOR \u00b6 1.p the day of the \nhearing, and he settled SOR \u00b6 1.s in December 2018.  (AE D; AE E; AE F; Tr. 54-58) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n remains unpaid and outstanding. (Tr. 62) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and his debts were \ndischarged a few months later. This bankruptcy was related to a lawsuit that was filed \nagainst Applicant for a car accident that occurred while he was on active duty in the U.S. \nNavy. His insurance company went out of business, and Applicant was held responsible \nin the lawsuit. (GE 5; Tr. 68-70) \n \nIn June 2008, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, to prevent his \nvehicle from being repossessed. The bankruptcy was dismissed in November 2010, due \nto Applicant\u2019s failure to make payments according to the bankruptcy plan. (GE 6; Tr. 70-\n72) \n \nApplicant provided an updated credit report, which reflected three new unalleged \ndelinquent debts, totaling over $1,000. In his post-hearing submission, he provided \ndocumentation to show that he paid and resolved an additional unalleged debt. (AE H; \nAE I) Applicant does not follow a written budget, nor has he received credit counseling. \nAt the time of the hearing he had $2,900 in savings to resolve his $32,800 in delinquent \nalleged debts. (Tr. 32-33, 60)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \n\n \n4 \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish two disqualifying \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \n\n \n5 \n \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant provided documentary evidence that he recently resolved 7 of the debts \nalleged in the SOR. However, he failed to provide substantiation to support his claims of \nother debt-resolution efforts. The majority of the alleged debts remain delinquent and \noutstanding. He receives partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). \n \nHis two bankruptcy filings demonstrate that his financial issues have been an \nongoing issue for a number of years, and they are not isolated to his 2013 to 2017 period \nof unemployment and underemployment. Applicant\u2019s new unalleged debts further \ndemonstrate that his financial issues are an ongoing and unresolved problem. Finally, \nApplicant failed to demonstrate that he acted responsibly to address his delinquent debts \nafter his employment issues ended in 2017. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b), was \nnot established.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I conclude Applicant did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. \nHe failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d \u2013 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i \u2013 1.j: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k \u2013 1.l: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n \u2013 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.q \u2013 1.r:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nCAROLINE E.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted some of the SOR allegations, with explanations and denied others. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for this employer since August 2016. He was unemployed from November 2015 to June 2016 and from April to July 2015. He is a high school graduate. He is twice divorced.

Eligibility for access to \nsensitive information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 23, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal \nconduct. DOD acted under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines implemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \n \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on March 14, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 24, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 23, \n2019, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on July 23, 2019. The Government \noffered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were admitted into evidence without objection. \n\n \n2 \n \nThe Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified \nand offered exhibits (AE) A through G, which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The record remained open to allow both sides to produce additional evidence. \nPost-hearing, the Government offered GE 9 and Applicant offered AE H through L. All \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on August \n7, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted some of the SOR allegations, with explanations and denied \nothers. His admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for \nthis employer since August 2016. He was unemployed from November 2015 to June \n2016 and from April to July 2015. He is a high school graduate. He is twice divorced. \nHis first marriage was from 1988 to 1993 and his second marriage was from 1994 to \n2008. He has three children from each marriage. (Tr. 7, 27-30; GE1)  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2013-2015 federal income tax \nreturns; that he owes approximately $9,725 for delinquent federal taxes for tax years \n2014-2017; that he failed to file state income tax returns for tax years 2012-2015; that \nhe is indebted to the state in the amount of $840, for which four state tax liens were \nentered; that he has five delinquent debts, including past-due mortgage payments, an \nauto repossession account, and three collection accounts totaling $11,023. The SOR \nalso alleged, as both personal and criminal conduct concerns, that Applicant was \ncharged in 2012 with assault of a family member; in 2004 he was arrested and charged \nwith lewdness involving a child; in August 2003, he was cited for having an open \ncontainer; in November 1986, he was convicted of shoplifting; and in July 1985 he was \ncharged with being a minor in possession of alcohol. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his \nanswer, credit reports, and court and police documents establish the allegations. (Ans., \nGE 3-8) \n \nFinancial \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties. He has two earlier bankruptcy \ndischarges, a Chapter 7 discharge in 1993 and a Chapter 13 discharge in 2000. (These \nbankruptcies were not alleged in the SOR, so I will not use them as a basis for \ndisqualification, but I will use them to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility, the potential \napplication of mitigating conditions, and in my whole-person analysis) Applicant \nexperienced periods of unemployment in 2015 and 2016. Applicant owns a home, which \nhe leases out, and some undeveloped property (about 40 acres), which he owns free \nand clear. He pays $900 monthly for a well that is on the land. His take-home monthly \npay is approximately $5,000. (Tr. 46-48, 51-52, 61, 63; GE 1, 2, 9) The status of the \nSOR-related debts is as follows:    \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (failure to file 2013-2015 federal tax returns): \n \n \nApplicant admitted not timely filing his federal tax returns and testified that \nbecause of his periods of unemployment he could not afford to pay what he owed in \ntaxes and therefore he did not file his returns for those years, except for tax year 2013. \nApplicant provided documentation showing his 2013 federal tax return was timely filed. \nHe claims that his 2014 and 2015 returns were filed in March 2017, but he failed to \nprovide supporting documentation. He also claims that his 2016-2018 federal returns \nwere timely filed. (Tr. 31-35; GE 2: AE A) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (delinquent federal taxes for 2014-2017 in the amount of $9,725): \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing federal taxes for those years. He provided \ndocumentation showing that he entered into a payment agreement with the IRS in July \n2018 to make monthly payments of $130 on his approximately $10,000 delinquent tax \ndebt. He also documented regular payments from his bank account to the IRS from \nNovember 2018 to May 2019 of $130. (Tr. 35-38; AE A, G, K) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c -\u00b6 1.g (failure to file 2009, 2012-2015 state tax returns and amount owed \nto the state documented by four tax liens in 2009, 2013-2015): \n \n \nApplicant admitted not timely filing his state tax returns for the same reason he \ndid not file his federal returns\u2014because he did not have the money to pay them at the \ntime. He provided documentation showing that he had a zero balance on his state tax \ndebt as of January 2019, and that all the liens against him were released because all \nthe underlying tax debt was paid. Several of these debts were due to Applicant\u2019s \nproperty taxes on the land that he owns not for state income tax debt. (Tr. 20-41; AE B) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h (auto repossession debt-$6,233): \n \n \nApplicant explained this debt arose when he co-signed on an automobile lease \nagreement for his son in approximately 2008. His son lost his job and was unable to \ncontinue making the monthly lease payments. In 2009, he turned in the car to the \nleasing company. This was earlier than the contract allowed for. Applicant\u2019s son failed to \nmake payments on the remaining lease term and the debt accrued to Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s son provided a letter acknowledging his responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 53; \nAE I) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i (past-due mortgage payment-$2,322): \n \n \nApplicant had become past due on his mortgage payments in the past. He \nprovided documentation showing that as of February 2019, he was current on those \npayments with no indication of any past-due amount. (Tr. 55; GE 2; AE C) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j (collection debt-$1,472): \n \n \nApplicant claims he settled this debt in January 2019 with a collection company \nrepresenting the creditor. This debt does not appear on his March 2019 credit report. \n(Tr. 56; GE 5; AE D) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k (collection debt-$636): \n \n \nApplicant claims this debt was for internet equipment that was returned but never \ntaken off his account. This debt does not appear on his March 2019 credit report. (Tr. \n56-57; GE 5; AE H) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l (collection debt-$360): \n \n \nApplicant claims this debt was for a school fee attributed to his daughter. This \ndebt does not appear on his March 2019 credit report. (Tr. 58; GE 5; AE H) \n \nPersonal and Criminal Conduct \n \n \nIn March 2012, Applicant and his stepdaughter got into a dispute at their home. \nEach one stuck the other party. The police arrived and cited both parties for disorderly \nconduct. No prosecution resulted but Applicant attended an anger management class. \nNo further incidents have occurred between the two of them. (Tr. 45-46; GE 2, 8) \n \n \nIn January 2004, Applicant was home with his two stepdaughters (S1 (13 or 14 \nyears old) and S2 (7 or 8 years old)) who were asleep on the couch in the living room. \nApplicant tried to wake up the girls and have them move into the bedroom. S1 would not \nwake up and remained on the couch. Thereafter, both S1 and S2 told their mother that \nApplicant touched them inappropriately. The girls were interviewed by child protective \nservices. S2 recanted her allegations against Applicant and further stated that S1 had \ntold her to say that she had been inappropriately touched by Applicant even though she \nhad not been touched. Applicant denied any inappropriate touching of the girls. \nApplicant was initially charged with lewd behavior involving a child, a misdemeanor in \nMarch 2004. The charge was dismissed without prejudice in June 2004. Applicant was \nnever recharged with this offense. This incident was investigated by the DOD in 2009 \nduring an earlier investigation. Applicant was not denied trustworthiness determination \nbecause of that incident. (Tr. 44; GE 1-2; AE F) \n \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant was cited for possessing an open alcoholic container. \nWhile driving home from work, Applicant had an open can of beer in his car. He was \nstopped by a law enforcement officer and cited for the open container violation. He went \nto court and paid a fine for the infraction. This incident was investigated by the DOD in \n2009 during an earlier investigation. Applicant was not denied trustworthiness \ndetermination because of that incident. (GE 2; AE F) \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant admitted shoplifting four cassette tapes from a local retail store in 1986. \nHe was charged, pleaded guilty, was fined, and placed on probation for one year. This \nincident was investigated by the DOD in 2009 during an earlier investigation. Applicant \nwas not denied trustworthiness determination because of that incident. (GE 2; AE F) \n \n \nIn July 1985, Applicant was arrested at a party for being a minor in possession of \nalcohol and misrepresenting his age. He pleaded guilty and received a fine.  This \nincident was investigated by the DOD in 2009 during an earlier investigation. Applicant \nwas not denied trustworthiness determination because of that incident. (GE 2, 6; AE F) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant provided four letters of support from his work supervisors. All attest that \nhe is a dedicated and reliable employee who performs hazardous duties on a daily \nbasis. He follows the company\u2019s rules and procedures. His operations manager noted \nthat Applicant does community volunteer work and is respected for doing so. (AE L)   \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n\n \n6 \n \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \n \n \n \nApplicant had delinquent debts. He also failed to timely file his 2014 and 2015 \nfederal income tax returns; his 2009 and 2012 through 2015 state income tax returns; \nhe owed approximately $9,700 in federal taxes for years 2014 through 2017; and he \nowed state taxes for years 2009 and 2013 through 2015. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n  \n  \nSeveral financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n7 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and   \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent, multiple, and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Although he has filed all his federal and state tax \nreturns, paid all his state tax obligations, and established a payment plan with the IRS \nfor his unresolved federal tax debt, he only recently took these actions. His remaining \nnon-federal tax debt appears resolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant was unemployed for periods of time. This is a condition beyond his \ncontrol. He eventually resolved his state tax debt and consumer debts, but failed to \nrespond to his federal tax obligations in a timely manner. AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence of financial counselling. Given the unpaid status of his \nfederal tax debt and his history of financial troubles, including two previous \nbankruptcies, there are not clear indications that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are \nunder control. Although Applicant filed his federal and state tax returns before the \nissuance of the SOR, he did not pay his state tax debt until after the issuance of the \nSOR and his payment plan with the IRS is ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(c) and \u00b6 20(d) partially \napply. Applicant also receives credit under AG  \u00b6 20(g) for establishing a payment plan \nwith the IRS. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct trustworthiness concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n\n \n8 \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially \napplicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information \n \nAppellant was involved with five criminal incidents in the timeframe from 1985 \nthrough 2012. While they may or may not arise to the level of criminal activity sufficient \nto cause concern under the criminal conduct guideline, they do raise the issue of \nApplicant\u2019s judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) applies. \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant:  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \n \nAppellant was last involved in a law enforcement matter in 2012 and the charges \nwere dropped. He has not had any further disputes with his stepdaughter, which led to \nthe 2012 incident. The remaining incidents were not repeated and are mitigated by age. \nIt is unlikely this behavior will recur and Appellant\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness have \nnot been impacted. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set \nout in AG \u00b6 30: \n \n\n \n9 \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \n \nAppellant was arrested or cited on criminal charges on two occasions in 2004 \nand 2012. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies.  \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;    \n \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \n \nThe most recent criminal charge against Appellant occurred in 2012 and involved \nan altercation with his stepdaughter. A police report describes culpability by both \nparties. The charge was dropped and Applicant completed an anger management \ncourse. No repeat incidents have occurred since that time. The alleged lewdness \ncharge was dismissed when one of the witnesses recanted. That charge was never \nresurrected. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), 32(c), and 32(d) apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nsensitive information must be an overall commonsense assessment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant \nadditional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s letters of support; the circumstances by which he \nbecame indebted; and that he resolved his state tax debt, paid his consumer debt, and \nset up a payment plan with the IRS. However, I also considered that he failed to timely \nfile his federal and state tax returns and the length of time he took to act on his federal \nand state tax obligations. He has not established a meaningful track record of financial \nresponsibility, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his future debts. The \nGuideline E and J concerns were mitigated, mostly by the passage of time.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to sensitive information. For all these \nreasons, I conclude that although Applicant mitigated the Guideline E and J concerns, \nhe has not mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a \u2013 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.d \u2013 1.l:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 2.a \u2013 2.e:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph:   3.a: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national \nsecurity to grant Applicant eligibility for access to sensitive information. Eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information is denied. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Applicant is a 49-year-old high school graduate who retired from the U.S. military in late August 2016 after over 24 years of active-duty service. He served honorably and achieved the rank of chief petty officer. He has worked for a defense contractor as a uniformed protection officer since August 2016. (GE 1; AEs J-K.)

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n04/17/2019 \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in February 2019 \nseeking a discharge of most of their debt exceeding $1.2 million, including approximately \n$40,000 in defaulted credit-card and loan debt. Serious medical issues for Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and daughter have strained their household finances since 2010, but it is too soon \nto conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are safely in the past. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn October 5, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. The SOR explained why the DOD CAF was \nunable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security \nclearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 13, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn January 8, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On January 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for February 14, \n2019. \n \nAt the hearing, four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) were admitted. A December 26, \n2018 letter (HE 1) forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs (HE II) \nwere marked as hearing exhibits (HE) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Thirteen \nApplicant exhibits (AEs A-M) were admitted in evidence. AE E, part of a February 2019 \ncredit report, was admitted over the Government\u2019s objections. Applicant and his spouse \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 5, 2018, Applicant owed \ncharged-off debts of $9,842 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $4,333 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); $2,026 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $934 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f); $560 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); $3,384 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and $2,785 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Applicant was \nalleged to owe collection debts of $3,598 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); $1,542 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $229 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h); $2,336 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and $319 (SOR 1.l). When Applicant responded to the SOR, he \nadmitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.g, 1.i-1.j, and 1.l. He denied the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e, 1.f, 1.h, and 1.k, contending that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k are the same debt. \nAt his hearing, he indicated that he was no longer denying the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and \n1.k. In his Answer, Applicant explained that his spouse is currently on disability because of \na chronic illness, and that he and his spouse have retained an attorney to assist them with \na bankruptcy filing. (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n  \nApplicant is a 49-year-old high school graduate who retired from the U.S. military in \nlate August 2016 after over 24 years of active-duty service. He served honorably and \nachieved the rank of chief petty officer. He has worked for a defense contractor as a \nuniformed protection officer since August 2016. (GE 1; AEs J-K.) Applicant was granted a \nsecret clearance in July 2014. (GE 4; AE K.) His employer has requested that he obtain a \ntop secret clearance. (Tr. 109.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse have been married since March 1994, although they have \nbeen together longer. (GE 1; Tr. 45.) They have two daughters, ages 24 and 27. Applicant \nadopted his older daughter when she was three years old. (Tr. 111.) \n\n3 \n \nApplicant directly supported Operation Enduring Freedom, and he was awarded \nseveral decorations and medals for meritorious military service. (AE J.) Because of his \nvarious military deployments, including 21 months in Southwest Asia,1 his spouse handled \ntheir household finances with little oversight from him. (Tr. 103-105, 117-118.) Applicant\u2019s \nspouse worked as a laboratory technician part time, earning $30,000 a year before July \n2007. (GE 1; Tr. 55.) In 2008, she was diagnosed with cancer. When her illness went into \nremission, she worked in the healthcare industry earning $40,000 a year. In 2010, \nApplicant and his spouse\u2019s younger daughter was diagnosed with bone marrow failure, \nwhich was treated with a very expensive medication.2 (AEs A-B; Tr. 30, 53.) TRICARE \ncovered of some of her medical expenses at 80%, and for about one year, Applicant\u2019s \nspouse had a second insurance through her employer. She lost the insurance coverage \nwhen she became a per-diem employee so that she could care for their daughter. (Tr. 47-\n48.) \n \nIn 2012, Applicant\u2019s spouse stopped working after she was injured at work. (GE 4; \nTr. 56.) In July 2012, Applicant purchased a 2008 model-year vehicle, obtaining a six-year \nloan of $25,350 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His monthly car payments were $594. Applicant\u2019s spouse \nmade the car payments on time for a couple of years, despite mounting medical expenses. \n(GE 2.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that she and Applicant paid about $130,000 to $140,000 \nout-of-pocket for their daughter\u2019s medical care over the years, including about $3,200 a \nmonth for approximately nine months from 2012 to 2013 for a medication when their \ndaughter, then age 18, was pregnant. (Tr. 30-32, 53.) Applicant did not present \ndocumentation showing those payments. He submitted records for their daughter\u2019s care in \n2013 which show that claims totaling $1,096,086 were submitted to TRICARE for her \nchemotherapy from January 15, 2013, to August 15, 2013.3 (AE A.) Separate hospital \nbilling records for their daughter show expenses of $193,578 incurred between January 2, \n2013, and July 18, 2013, that were paid by TRICARE or written off as \u201cother govt. \nallowance.\u201d (AE B.) However, approximately $1,097,394 owed to a cancer institute for their \ndaughter\u2019s care went unpaid.4 (AE I.)  \n                                                 \n1 Applicant did not detail his deployments. His SF 86 indicates that he was in Southwest Asia from June 2006 \nto June 2007. (GE 1.) He was apparently deployed to Kuwait from May 2009 to February 2010. (GE 2.) His DD \n214 indicates that he received the Iraq Campaign Medal and that he served one year and nine months in Iraq. \n(AE J.) \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that she went into remission in 2010 and that \u201calmost to the day that [she] was in \nremission,\u201d their daughter was diagnosed with bone marrow failure; that their insurance did not then cover the \ntreatments; and that she and Applicant paid about $130,000 to $140,000 out-of-pocket for their daughter\u2019s \ncare. (Tr. 30.) According to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, the debt to the cancer institute was incurred in \nDecember 2010. (AE I.) \n \n3 Applicant\u2019s daughter married her child\u2019s father in January 2013. (GE 1.) Available custody records indicate \nthat her husband was \u201coften at sea.\u201d (AE C.) He was apparently in the military. Neither Applicant nor his \nspouse explained why they continued to pay medical expenses for their daughter after her marriage, although \nthere is no evidence that their daughter had insurance coverage other than TRICARE through Applicant. \n \n4 Applicant did not submit any medical records from the cancer institute. The TRICARE claims in AE A could \nbe for care at the cancer institute, although they do not name the provider of care. She was treated with \n\n4 \n \nApplicant\u2019s daughter gave birth to a daughter in April 2013, and in 2014, she lost \ntemporary custody of her child to her parents. She had serious drug addiction issues, and \nher husband was often at sea. In December 2014, Applicant and his spouse were granted \nlegal permanent custody of their granddaughter. Their daughter had relapsed into drug \nabuse after attending an intensive drug-rehabilitation program. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 34, 122.) \nIn February 2016, the court denied a motion to terminate Applicant and his spouse\u2019s \nguardianship of their granddaughter. (AE C.) As of February 2019, Applicant and his \nspouse want to adopt their grandchild, but the father will not give up his parental rights. (Tr. \n46-47, 123.) \n \n In March 2014, Applicant\u2019s spouse was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and given \na life expectancy of three to five years. (Tr. 33, 45.) In December 2016, she became \neligible for hospital insurance under Medicare. In June 2017, she was granted Social \nSecurity disability status, and she became eligible for Medicare medical insurance. She \nreceived a lump-sum payment of $20,458 in retroactive disability income, and began \nreceiving monthly Social Security Disability income (SSDI) of $554 a month. (AE D; Tr. 56-\n58.) The lump-sum disability payment went to repair a vehicle and to catch up on some \nhousehold bills. (Tr. 57.) \n \nApplicant continued to perform his military duties with professionalism despite his \ndifficult family circumstances. His enlisted performance evaluation for 2015 indicates he \nhad his superior\u2019s highest recommendation for advancement. Applicant was considered the \n\u201cideal ambassador\u201d for military bearing and rated as excellent in several competencies. (AE \nL.) Applicant went on terminal leave from the U.S. military in June 2016. (AE J; Tr. 104-\n106.)  \n \n Applicant began working for his defense-contractor employer in August 2016. On \nSeptember 4, 2016, he completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) on which he disclosed one delinquency involving \nroutine accounts. He indicated that he owed approximately $3,000 on a loan for a vehicle \nthat was voluntarily repossessed (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He explained that the debt was incurred \nbecause of his spouse\u2019s and his daughter\u2019s medical issues. He indicated that the creditor \nwas willing to settle the debt for a lump sum and that his spouse would be receiving a \nsettlement that would be used to pay off their debts so that they would be debt free by the \nend of the year. (GE 1.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on September 29, 2016, revealed that the creditor \nlisted on his SF 86 had charged off his auto loan for $9,842 in July 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nMoreover, he owed several other past-due debts. A utility provider had charged off his \naccount for $3,384 in December 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Equifax and Experian reported a \npayday loan obtained in December 2012 had been charged off for $2,917 in January 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b). Trans Union reported that the creditor had charged off a note loan obtained in \nDecember 2012 for $2,785 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). Dates of last activity for both credit entries was \nMay 2015, so they could be the same debt. A credit-card account opened in October 2015 \n                                                                                                                                                             \neculizumab, which is a very expensive chemotherapy drug. The TRICARE records show only the charges and \nnot what TRICARE paid, if anything. Their daughter was listed as an established patient at that time. (AE A.) \n\n5 \n \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) was in collection for $934 due to inactivity since June 2016. Applicant owed \n$516 on another credit card with the creditor that was suspended because it was 90 days \npast due (SOR \u00b6 1.g).5 An unsecured loan obtained for $6,251 in June 2013 was more \nthan 120 days past due with a balance of $1,301 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). No payments had been \nmade on the debt in the previous two years. Two cellphone accounts from 2013 and 2012 \nwere in collection for $2,336 (SOR \u00b6 1.k) and $229 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). A cable television and \nInternet service provider placed $319 for collection in December 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). (GEs 2-\n4.) \n \nOn August 24, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He explained that his spouse handled their \nfinances because of his multiple deployments and security details when he was in the \nmilitary. Applicant admitted that he did not pay attention to his bills, and until recently, he \nbelieved that his household finances were in order. He became alerted to some financial \nstruggles when his vehicle was voluntarily repossessed in approximately 2014. He \nregained possession after paying the past-due balance, but his spouse again fell behind on \nhis loan payments. They then surrendered the vehicle voluntarily, and were led to believe \nthat the creditor would settle his balance for $3,000. They did not have the funds to make a \nlump-sum payment so the unpaid balance accrued to approximately $9,000. Applicant \nstated that it was likely that other debts were over 120 days past due or in collection, but he \ndid not know for sure. When confronted with the debts on his credit record, Applicant \nrecalled the utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b, possibly duplicated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.j), which first came to his attention during his 2014 background investigation. He \ndenied any knowledge of the other delinquencies on his credit record, and explained that \nhe had not known that his spouse had obtained the credit cards with the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.f and 1.g.6 (GE 4.) \n \nApplicant told the OPM investigator that he took over the family\u2019s finances in August \n2017; that he was surprised to learn that there were delinquent credit-card accounts on his \ncredit record because his spouse told him she did not have any credit cards; and that he \nwould contact his creditors to settle his debts. Applicant volunteered that he was granted a \nservice-connected disability of 90% in August 2017, and that he would make payments \ntoward his debts on receipt of about $24,000 in expected retroactive disability income. He \nadded that his spouse had a pending worker\u2019s compensation claim. Applicant showed little \nknowledge of his household expenses. He reported monthly income of $1,300 from his \nemployment and $2,100 per month from his military pension. He acknowledged that he \nhad been negligent concerning his financial responsibilities, and indicated that resolution of \nhis debts was largely dependent on his spouse\u2019s settlement of her work injury. (GE 4.) \n \n                                                 \n5 The credit cards are listed as individual accounts on Applicant\u2019s credit record. Neither Applicant nor his \nspouse explained how the debts were incurred. It is possible that his spouse was an authorized user on his \naccounts, but there is no evidence in that regard. \n  \n6 Applicant\u2019s September 2016 credit report (GE 2) lists the accounts as individual accounts, so Applicant either \nopened them or his spouse opened them in his name. \n\n6 \n \nFor calendar year 2017, Applicant had $78,985 in wage income, $30,708 in military \nretirement income, and $11,408 in Veterans Affairs (VA) disability income. His spouse had \nher SSDI of $23,782. (AE I.) \n \nIn June 2018, Applicant\u2019s spouse had a motor vehicle accident. She testified that \nshe owed \u201cless than $8,000\u201d on her car loan, but she had let the insurance lapse because \nshe was considering trading it for another vehicle. She agreed to a voluntary repossession \nbelieving she had equity in the car, but she was held liable for a $29,119 balance on the \nloan. (AE I; Tr. 65-66.) Applicant and his spouse then purchased a 2017 model-year \nminivan for her. They obtained a loan for $32,814 at 26% interest. Monthly payments are \n$753 per month for 72 months. (GE 3; Tr. 67-69.) Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s disability income \ncovers the monthly payment and insurance on the vehicle. (Tr. 70.) \n \nAs of September 2018, Equifax was reporting past-due balances of $9,842 on \nApplicant\u2019s defaulted car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a); $4,333 on the payday loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b; \n$2,026 on the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d; and $934 and $560 on the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and \n1.g. Three debts were reportedly in collection: a $229 cellphone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h); a loan \ninactive since December 2015 with a balance of $3,596 (SOR \u00b6 1.c, no account number \nlisted); and a cellphone debt from August 2017 with a balance of $1,542 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nApplicant and his spouse dispute the balance of the cellphone debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e because \nafter their contract ended, they returned the cellphones to the provider, who gave them \nonly the trade-in amount and not what the phones are worth. A collection entity now holds \nthe debt. (AE I; Tr. 90-91.) The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.l were no longer on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport. (GE 3.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse continues to receive medical treatment, but her co-payments are \naffordable. (Tr. 50.) In October 2018, she had three major surgeries. She was billed \n$3,600, although she believes she is legally responsible for only $1,000 of that amount. \nShe resubmitted a claim to TRICARE. (Tr. 51-52.) She has incurred approximately $2,100 \nin dental expenses since October 2018. (Tr. 80.) She estimates that they have paid \n$15,000 in medical expenses over the years for her care. (Tr. 54.) Applicant and his \nspouse have not paid any medical expenses for their daughter since 2015. (Tr. 49.) \n \nOn October 5, 2018, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because of the \ndelinquent consumer credit (non-medical) debts on his credit reports totaling $31,886. \nWhen he responded to the SOR on November 13, 2018, Applicant indicated that he and \nhis spouse had retained an attorney to assist them in a bankruptcy filing. (Answer.) \nApplicant had previously resisted filing for bankruptcy in the belief that they could repair \ntheir financial situation. After becoming involved in their finances, he realized that their debt \ncould not be repaid. (Tr. 118-121.) Applicant and his spouse received $2,938 in child \nsupport in 2018. Applicant\u2019s wage earnings totaled $63,262. His retirement income was \n$31,008, and he received $24,500 in VA disability payments. Applicant\u2019s spouse had only \nher monthly disability income, which totaled $7,754. (AE I.) Their outstanding debt \nexceeded $1.2 million. (AE I.) \n \n\n7 \n \nAs of December 2018, Applicant and his spouse were approximately $629 past due \nfor utility service at their current residence. Applicant arranged to repay the past-due \nbalance at $187.24 per month starting in February 2019.7 (AE F; Tr. 77-78.)  \n \nOn January 15, 2019, Applicant and his spouse retained a bankruptcy attorney at a \nfee of $2,500 plus the $335 bankruptcy filing fee. (AE H.) To assist in preparing their \nbankruptcy petition, Applicant and his spouse obtained their credit reports. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report showing five outstanding balances on closed accounts:  SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($9,842); \n1.b ($4,658); 1.d ($2,180); 1.f ($934); and 1.g ($560). (AE E.) On February 5, 2019, \nApplicant and his spouse obtained the credit counseling required to file for bankruptcy. (AE \nG.) \n \nOn February 12, 2019, Applicant and his spouse filed a joint Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition. They listed $44,555 in secured claims: a 401(k) account valued at $19,823;8 the \ncar purchased in June 2018 on which they owed $32,879; and a 2008 model-year vehicle \non which Applicant owed $3,996.9 They claimed their secured property as exempt from the \nbankruptcy. They listed nonpriority unsecured claims totaling $1,218,082, which included a \n$1,097,394 medical debt owed to a cancer institute for their daughter\u2019s care;10  the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d-1.g, 1.i, and 1.k-1.l;11 and a $1,267 credit-card debt of Applicant\u2019s \nincurred in March 2013 that was not alleged in the SOR.12  Several other debts belonged to \nhis spouse, including $45,577 in student loans. They included some medical creditors with \n                                                 \n7 Applicant\u2019s spouse initially testified that they had an outstanding utility bill with the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i since \n2012 that was rolled into their current account, and that they have been paying an extra $187 per month for \nthe last nine months to repay the debt. (Tr. 37-38.) However, documentation from the creditor shows a \nrepayment arrangement to pay $187.24 monthly from February 2019 through December 2019. (AE F.) When \nasked on cross-examination about repayment of any of the SOR debts, Applicant\u2019s spouse responded that \npayments were made to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.i, but it appears that the $187 payments are to resolve a \nrecent utility delinquency. (Tr. 77-78.) She admitted that the repayment arrangements were made after they \nreceived the SOR. The full $3,384 utility delinquency (SOR \u00b6 1.i) from 2011 is listed on their bankruptcy \npetition. (AE I.) \n  \n8 Applicant and his spouse listed a $7,680 claim (\u201c401(k) loan\u201d) incurred in June 2018 that is secured by the \n$19,823. (AE I.) Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that it is not a 401(k) loan but rather is Applicant\u2019s contribution to \nhis 401(k). (Tr. 86.) \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that they thought Applicant\u2019s vehicle was paid off, but after an audit of the \naccount, they were advised that they owed a balance. She offered to settle with the creditor for $1,300, and \nwas awaiting a response to her offer as of the hearing. (Tr. 67.) She was told the account had been charged \noff in 2015, even though she asserts that they had been making payments on the loan. (Tr. 85-86.) \n \n10 Applicant\u2019s spouse testified that they paid from $200 to $500 a month to the cancer institute at one point in \nan effort to keep the debt off their credit reports. (Tr. 81.) \n \n11 Applicant and his spouse included among their nonpriority unsecured debts a loan of Applicant\u2019s in \ncollection for $3,780. It may well be the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, although it is unclear. They did not include the loan \nin SOR \u00b6 1.j. Applicant\u2019s spouse asserted it was paid through military allotment before September 2016. (Tr. \n74-76.) The loan terms suggest that it is the same debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, which has not been paid and was listed \non their bankruptcy petition. Whether it is a duplicate listing or has been paid, it was no longer listed as a past-\ndue debt on Applicant\u2019s credit report as of September 2018. (GE 3; AE E.) \n \n12It is unclear whether that account was ever delinquent. It does not appear on Applicant\u2019s credit reports.  \n\n8 \n \nno balances listed. Their attorney advised them to list all their medical creditors, even those \nthat are being repaid. (Tr. 51.) In the 90 days preceding their bankruptcy filing, they \nreportedly had made payments totaling $16,169 toward their household expenses and \nmedical and dental bills. In the year before they filed, they gave $9,145 to Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law to cover their share of the expenses for a family camp; $4,070 to their older \ndaughter for her rent, daycare, college, and other expenses; $2,200 to Applicant\u2019s sister-in-\nlaw for summer camp for her son with special needs and for repairs to the family camp; \nand $10,000 to their younger daughter for her drug rehabilitation, rent, and food. (AE I.) In \nresponse to whether they made any gifts or contributions with a total value exceeding $600 \nto any charity in the two years preceding their filing, they listed church donations of \n$12,000. (AE I.) Applicant\u2019s spouse testified discrepantly that the $12,000 was donated \nover four years. (Tr. 66.) Applicant and his spouse reported cash assets on hand totaling \n$2,230, but one checking account was overdrawn for $103. (AE I.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse now handle their finances together. (Tr. 61.) Their \ncombined monthly income is $9,343, and their monthly expenses are $9,257. (AE I.) They \nare currently paying an estimated $800 in medical and dental expenses each month. They \nlease their cellphones, and they pay $482 a month for cellphone and cable service. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse testified that their cellphone and cable television contracts end in March \n2019. They plan to change to prepaid phone services at $30 a month since they will own \nthe phones and to reduce their cable costs by paying only for Internet service. (Tr. 87-88.) \nThey no longer take out any payday loans. (Tr. 95.) They have never been late on their \nrent. (Tr. 72.) Their finances were impacted by the partial government shutdown in January \n2019 in that Applicant did not receive his retirement pay on time. (AE M.) \n \nOn their bankruptcy petition, Applicant and his spouse reported that they are owed \n$7,900 in child support for their granddaughter\u2019s care. (AE I.) They currently receive $188 \nmonthly in child support. (Tr. 61.) Applicant is still owed retroactive disability pay from the \nVA for the period June 2016 to July 2017. (Tr. 62, 115.) His spouse received $166,000 \nfrom her work-injury settlement after her lawyer took his fee. Applicant\u2019s spouse testified \nthat the funds went to TRICARE and Medicare for her medical expenses associated with \nher accident. (Tr. 63-64.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse owe no past-due taxes, although they anticipate that they \nwill owe about $1,100 to the Internal Revenue Service for tax year 2018. They plan to \nrepay any taxes owed under an installment repayment plan. (Tr. 97.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse attended college from 2004 to 2008. She made some student \nloan payments of $348 to $412 per month from 2010 until 2017. When the current loan \nservicer acquired her loans, her monthly payment ballooned to $756. Her loans were then \nplaced in forbearance. Applicant and his spouse understand that her student loans will not \nbe dismissed in their bankruptcy, but they believe the loans might be discharged because \nof her disability. (Tr. 97-101.) \n \nApplicant and his spouse provide some financial assistance to their older daughter \nwhen they can. She works as a nurse but is a single mother. (Tr. 98.)   \n\n9 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n10 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \nAvailable credit reports and the bankruptcy petition establish the delinquencies in \nthe SOR, with the possible exception of the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.j, which was paid or is \npossibly an earlier balance of the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy records show \nthat his and his spouse\u2019s financial problems are more extensive than those alleged in the \nSOR. Although several of the nonpriority unsecured debts belong to his spouse, Applicant \nand his spouse are jointly liable on some unalleged debts, including a medical debt \nexceeding $1 million owed to a cancer institute. Applicant\u2019s loan for his current vehicle, \nwhich he had believed was paid off, was charged off for approximately $3,996. Debts not \nincluded in the SOR cannot be considered for disqualifying purposes.13 Even so, the debts \n                                                 \n13 In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \n\n11 \n \nalleged in the SOR are enough to implicate disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing matters in mitigation. One or more of the \nfollowing conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i is a charge-off balance from December 2011. \nThe cellphone delinquencies in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k are from 2013 and 2012, respectively. \nNeither Applicant nor his spouse made any payments on the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.d for at least \ntwo years as of August 2016. Respective dates of last activity on the car loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nand the payday loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b) were June 2015 and May 2015. These delinquencies \nwere not incurred recently, but they had not been paid as of February 2019. The credit card \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g became past due in 2016. They too had not been paid as of \nFebruary 2019. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate such persistent delinquency.14 \n \nApplicant has a considerable case for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). His younger \ndaughter\u2019s serious medical issue led his spouse to become a per-diem employee to give \n                                                                                                                                                             \nDirective Section 6.3. \n \n14 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for the purposes of \nthe Guideline F mitigation conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06352 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n\n12 \n \nher more time to care for their daughter, but they lost secondary medical insurance \ncoverage as a result. Available hospital billing records from 2013 show that some medical \nexpenses for their daughter were either paid or written off, but Applicant and his spouse \nincurred more than $1 million in non-covered medical costs for their daughter\u2019s care. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse suffered an unforeseen injury at work in 2012. She was still \nunemployed when she was diagnosed with a terminal illness in March 2014. Her medical \nexpenses were largely covered by insurance, but they had only one income for several \nyears. Applicant was granted a 90% VA disability starting in August 2016, and he began \nreceiving his military retirement, but his spouse did not receive any SSDI until June 2017. \nThe delay in her receipt of SSDI was outside of her control. By then, the accounts in the \nSOR were already charged off or in collection. \n \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply, Applicant is required to have acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. An element of financial responsibility is knowing the status of one\u2019s \nfinancial obligations. Due to his multiple deployments and other military duties that kept him \naway from home for extended periods, Applicant had his spouse handle their finances. \nWhile perhaps understandable under the circumstances, Applicant should have exercised \nsome oversight, especially over the accounts in his name. Given the expense of his \ndaughter\u2019s treatments over the years, Applicant had good reason to question whether he \nand his spouse were meeting all their financial obligations. Applicant knew as of 2014, \nwhen his vehicle was initially repossessed, that they had some financial problems. He \napparently relied on his spouse\u2019s assurances that they had no past-due credit cards. \nApplicant told an OPM investigator that he took over the family\u2019s finances in August 2017. \nAlthough his spouse needed a vehicle after her accident in June 2018, one has to question \nApplicant\u2019s financial judgment in agreeing to take on a $754 monthly car payment, even if \nher SSDI covers the loan payments. Applicant and his spouse live from paycheck to \npaycheck in part because of the choices that they made, including for cellphone, Internet, \nand cable television expenses totaling $428 a month. They gave money to family \nmembers, including for upkeep of a family camp, when collection debts went unpaid. It is \ndifficult to find that Applicant has acted fully responsibly with regard to handling his \npersonal finances, notwithstanding the considerable impact of several circumstances \noutside of his control. \n \n \nApplicant and his spouse filed for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy only two days before his \nsecurity clearance hearing. A bankruptcy filing does not preclude the Government from \nconsidering the negative security implications of an applicant\u2019s recurring financial \nproblems. See ADP Case No. 17-00684 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, 2018). In that regard, \nApplicant and his spouse had no record of financial problems before their daughter\u2019s \ndiagnosis. They obtained the financial counseling required for a filing, which satisfies the \nfirst component of AG \u00b6 20(c). A Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge would eliminate much, \nbut not all, of their financial stress. There is the matter of his spouse\u2019s student loans, which \nare not likely to be discharged in the bankruptcy. His spouse may be relieved of her legal \nliability for the loans because of her disability, but that remains to be seen. It would be \npremature to fully apply either AG \u00b6 20(c) or AG \u00b6 20(d) without a bankruptcy discharge. \nThe meeting of creditors had not been held as of the close of the evidentiary record. They \nwere behind on their utility account as recently as December 2018. AG \u00b6 20(e) could have \n\n13 \n \nsome applicability, but only to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j in that it may be a duplicate listing of \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b or paid off before the SOR was issued. The debt no longer appears \non Applicant\u2019s credit report. The financial considerations security concerns are not fully \nmitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not intended as a debt \ncollection process or designed to punish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. See \nISCR Case No. 17-01473 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018). Yet Applicant\u2019s creditors will be left \nwith no legal recourse if he is granted a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge. \n \nApplicant\u2019s more than 24 years of honorable active duty service weighs in his favor. \nBecause he was away from home for long periods, he relied on his spouse to handle their \nhousehold finances. Although his absence from home does not immunize him or excuse \nhim from responsibly monitoring his finances, it also appears that his spouse kept aspects \nof their finances from him. Applicant and his spouse have always paid their rent on time. \nThere is no evidence of any delinquency before serious medical illnesses for Applicant\u2019s \nspouse and daughter negatively impacted their finances starting in 2010. Applicant\u2019s \nspouse testified that she and Applicant have paid about $130,000 to $140,000 in medical \ncosts for their daughter over the years, although corroborating documentation was not \npresented in evidence. They currently pay about $800 a month in medical expenses. \nDespite annual income exceeding $100,000, they have no reasonable resort apart from a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy to relieve their significant debt burden. Even so, I cannot ignore the \ntiming of his efforts at debt resolution. Applicant indicated on November 13, 2018, in \nresponse to the SOR, that he and his spouse had retained an attorney to assist them in \nfiling for bankruptcy. They did not formally retain their bankruptcy attorney until January 15, \n2019. The Appeal Board recently reaffirmed that an applicant who begins to resolve his \ndebts only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy \u201cmay be \ndisinclined to follow rules and regulations when [his] personal interests are not at stake.\u201d \nSee ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 16-\n03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). \n \nIn exceptional cases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility \nfor a security clearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated.15 Applicant\u2019s financial situation will improve if much of his and his \n                                                 \n15 Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA administrative judges the \ndiscretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security clearance despite the presence of an \n\n14 \n \nspouse\u2019s debt is discharged in the bankruptcy, and if they reduce their monthly cellphone \nand cable service expenses as promised. However, Applicant has yet to demonstrate that \nhis financial situation is under control and that he can be counted on to make timely \npayments on his debts going forward. Based on the evidence before me, it would be \npremature to conclude that his financial problems are sufficiently resolved to where they no \nlonger present a security risk. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a security \nclearance in the future. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nevidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k-1.l: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 13, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on May 21, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \non May 24, 2019, scheduling the hearing for June 13, 2019. The hearing was convened \nas scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GX) 1 and 2, which were admitted \nwithout objection, and Hearing Exhibit (HX) I for Administrative Notice. Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, and presented three documents; which I marked Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AppXs) A through C, and admitted into evidence. The record was left open \n\n \n2 \n \nuntil July 12, 2019, for receipt of additional documentation, but Applicant submitted \nnothing further. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on June 25, 2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nAt the hearing, the Government requested I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to China. Department Counsel provided an eight-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by 15 Government documents pertaining to China, identified as HE I. \nThe documents provide elaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative \nnotice of the facts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters \nof general knowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the \nFindings of Fact. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.~1.d., and 1.f. He denied \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since 2007. (TR at page 17 line 5 to page 23 line \n24, and at page 27 line 3 to page 28 line 22.) Appellant served in the U.S. Army for five \nyears, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant, and was deployed to Iraq. (TR at page 24 \nline 1 to page 27 line 2.) He has held a security clearance since 2002, since joining the \nArmy after \u201c9/11.\u201d (Id.) He is married to a naturalized American citizen, and has three \nnative-born American children. (TR at page 19 lines 16~20.) \n \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \n1.a. and 1.b. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens of China, \nbut reside in a retirement home in the United States. (TR at page 29 line 20 to page 31 \nline 11, and at page 34 line 25 to page 35 line 11.) They have \u201cGreen Card[s],\u201d and are \nseeking to become U.S. citizens. (Id.) All they know about Applicant\u2019s work is that he is \n\u201can Engineer.\u201d (TR at page 30 line 21 to page 31 line 1.) They never worked for the \nChinese government, nor were members of the Chinese Communist Party. (TR at page \n31 lines 2~8.) \n \n \n1.c. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China. He is an \n\u201cEngineer,\u201d working for a \u201cpower company.\u201d (TR at page 31 line 12 to page 32 line 6.) \nApplicant has little contact with his brother-in-law, perhaps \u201conce a year . . . during the \nholidays.\u201d (Id.) \n \n \n1.d. Applicant\u2019s 70-year-old aunt is a citizen and resident of China. He last \ncontacted her about \u201c15/20 years ago.\u201d (TR at page 32 lines 7~18.) \n \n \n 1.e. Applicant is unsure if he has a bank account in China. He visited China in \n2000, and deposited about $3,500 in a bank account to cover his travel expenses. (TR \n\n \n3 \n \nat page 32 line 23 to page 33 line 19.) His net worth in the United States is about \n$2,500,000. (TR at page 21 line 24 to page 23 line 19, and at page 35 line 12 to page \n36 line 6.) \n \n \n1.f. Applicant\u2019s wife once had a company that partnered with a Chinese \ncompany. That partnership ceased in 2012, about seven years ago. (TR at page 33 line \n20 to page 34 line 19, and at 36 lines 8~10.)  \n \n \nNotice \n \n \nDepartment Counsel has asked me to take administrative notice about facts \nregarding China. China poses a great espionage and cyber-attack treat to the United \nStates. It is an authoritarian state, in which the Communist Party is the paramount \nauthority. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n4 \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest  \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s in-laws are Chinese nationals, and his wife once had a partnership \nwith a Chinese company. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law and father-in-law live in the United States, and are \nseeking to become U.S. citizens. He has little contact with his other Chinese national \nrelatives. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s business partnership ended seven years ago, and his net \nworth in the United States is $2,500,000. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant \nanswered his country\u2019s call and served in the U.S. Army for five years after 9/11. While \nhe was born in China, he is an American by choice. His closest familial ties are with his \nwife, children, and parents-in-law, who are American citizens, or seeking to become \nAmericans. His net worth in the United States is extensive. He can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States due to his longstanding ties \nhere.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.~1.f.: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant responded to the SOR on January 19, 2019, and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On May 2, 2019, he changed his \nrequest to a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJune 24, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 8, 2019. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1, 3, and 4 were admitted in evidence without objection. The objection to \nGE 2 was sustained. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and \nB, which were admitted without objection. The record was held open until October 9, \n2019, for Applicant to submit additional information. The deadline was extended at his \nrequest until November 5, 2019, and then again to November 18, 2019, and finally until \n\n \n2 \n \nDecember 9, 2019. He submitted e-mails and attached documents that I have marked \nAE C through I and admitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since August 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. military \nfrom 2003 to 2007 and from 2009 to 2013, during which he served multiple deployments \nto Iraq and Afghanistan. He was honorably discharged on both occasions. He attended \ncollege for a period, but he has not earned a degree. He is married for the third time \nafter his first two marriages ended in divorce. He has a stepchild in high school. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 21, 27-28, 38, 40, 76-77; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant experienced financial difficulties after his discharge from the military. \nHe moved three times in order to find suitable employment. He was unable to keep \ntenants in his rental home, and his divorces further contributed to his financial distress. \nHe also admitted that he was not as good at managing his finances as he could have \nbeen. (Tr. at 18-21, 28-32, 38-39, 43-44, 78-79; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the mortgage loan on Applicant\u2019s rental home that was in \nforeclosure and eight delinquent debts with balances totaling about $32,600. Applicant \nadmitted owing all the debts except the $186 and $291 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.h, which he stated were fraudulent accounts. Except as addressed below, the \nallegations are established through credit reports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \n \n \nApplicant lost his rental home to foreclosure in about 2015. Credit reports show a \nbalance on the loan as $18,370 after foreclosure (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He was in contact with \nthe creditor about resolving the balance, but those negotiations stopped after his \nclearance became an issue and his pay decreased. (Tr. at 42-49; Applicant\u2019s response \nto SOR; GE 1, 3, 4) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c allege debts of $13,900 and $9,004 to the same creditor. In \nhis January 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he reported that \nhe owed the creditor \u201c$20,000 (Estimated).\u201d He wrote that he was \u201ccurrently working \nwith [creditor] to pay off all remaining debts and get back in good standing. I have \nallocated the vast majority of my current earnings into that effort as it is my primary \nconcern.\u201d He further wrote that he \u201cestablished a once monthly payment with [creditor] \nin order to satisfy my debt to them.\u201d He wrote in his January 2019 response to the SOR \nthat he was working with the creditor to pay the debts, and he testified that he made \npayments. He documented a $400 payment to the creditor on September 18, 2019. (Tr. \nat 55-62; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 4; AE F) \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $5,786 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He \nwrote in his response to the SOR that he had contacted the creditor to pay off the debt. \nHe provided no documentary evidence of payment. (Tr. at 62-63; GE 3, 4) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant settled the $2,518 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $881, which he paid in \nJanuary 2019. He paid $300 in January 2019 to resolve the $600 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f. The disputed $186 and $291 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h are reported by \nExperian on the March 2017 combined credit report. They are not listed on the \nSeptember 2018 Equifax credit report. (Tr. at 63-64, 69-71; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 3, 4; AE A, B) \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the $379 debt to a pest control company (SOR \u00b6 1.i). \nHe wrote in his response to the SOR that the debt would be paid within a week. He did \nnot provide any evidence of payment. (Tr. at 72; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3) \n \n \nApplicant has worked with a credit repair and monitoring company for some time. \nHe stated that he also received financial counseling from another company. He \nestimated his annual \u201ctake-home\u201d pay was about $120,000 until his income increased \nsignificantly in about 2018 when his employer sent him on an overseas assignment. He \nis a 100% disabled veteran and receives about $3,400 per month from the Department \nof Veterans Affairs (VA). He was placed in a lesser-paid position in about October 2018 \nwhen his clearance became an issue. He estimated that he is currently earning about \n$65,000 annually from his employer. He stated that he plans to pay his debts. He \nindicated that if he receives his clearance, he will return to a higher-paying job, and he \nwill be in a better position to pay his debts. (Tr. at 22-25, 33-40, 48-52, 73-75, 79-80) \n \n \nApplicant testified that he earned almost $200,000 in 2018. He received a federal \nincome tax refund of about $19,000 from tax year 2017. He stated that he filed his 2018 \nfederal income tax return and expected a refund of about $20,000. He indicated that he \nwould use part of his refund to pay some of his debts. (Tr. at 66-71, 81-82) \n \n \nApplicant wrote in a post-hearing e-mail on October 7, 2019, that his \u201ctax return \narrived last week and [he had] been calling and paying debts as rapidly as possible.\u201d \n(AE C) He was granted additional time to submit additional information and \ndocumentation.  \n \n \nApplicant wrote another e-mail on November 5, 2019. He indicated that he \nsettled the $18,370 mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) for $9,175, through $800 monthly \npayments. He wrote that he settled the $13,900 and $9,004 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b and 1.c for $6,500 and $4,502, with monthly payments of the two debts of $1,100. \nHe also wrote that he paid the $5,786 credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. He did not \nsubmit any supporting documentation. (AE D) \n \n \nApplicant was reminded of the need for supporting documentation, and the \ndeadline for submitting additional evidence was extended again. He submitted e-mails \non November 18, 2019, and November 19, 2019. He indicated that he was working in a \nremote location on a military training event, which made it difficult to send documents. \nHe also stated that his father fell ill, and that he was flying to his father\u2019s location. He \nattached documentation of the $400 payment to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c creditor, which \nwas made on September 18, 2019 (this payment is addressed above). (AE E-G) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe deadline for Applicant to submit additional evidence was extended to \nNovember 25, 2019, and then again to December 9, 2019. He submitted an e-mail on \nDecember 9, 2019. He wrote that he was \u201creally on track to getting everything paid off \nrapidly now.\u201d He also wrote that his \u201cwife adjusted some of the payment plans due to \nthe credit counseling suggestions.\u201d The only documentation he submitted with the e-\nmail is information from a financial counseling company, which was dated June 8, 2018. \n(AE H, I) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n\n \n5 \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and a \nforeclosed mortgage loan. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n6 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant moved three times after his discharge from the military in order to find \nsuitable employment. He was unable to keep tenants in his rental home, and his \ndivorces also contributed to his financial distress. His father fell ill, and he had to fly to \nhis father\u2019s location. Those events were beyond his control. He also admitted that he \nwas not as good at managing his finances as he could have been. Additionally, he has \nworked for his current employer since August 2016 and has earned significant income \n(almost $200,000 in 2018, with income tax refunds of about $19,000 and $20,000 for \ntax years 2017 and 2018). \n \nApplicant is credited with resolving the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f. \nThose allegations are mitigated. He denied owing the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.h, and those debts are not listed on the most recent credit report. Those allegations \nare also mitigated.  \n \nApplicant made assertions about paying other debts, but except for one $400 \npayment, he did not provide documentation. His documented payments total $1,581 \nand all came after the SOR was issued. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is \nreasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present documentation about the \nsatisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, \n2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). Additionally, an \napplicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Finally, he stated that he \nintends to address his delinquent debts. However, intentions to pay debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \n \nThe bottom line in this case is that in spite of numerous opportunities, Applicant\u2019s \ndocumented payments did not match his statements. There is insufficient evidence for a \ndetermination that his financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I \n\n \n7 \n \nam unable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a \ngood-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant may reach a point where his finances are sufficiently in order to warrant a \nsecurity clearance, but he has not established that he is there at this time. I find that \nfinancial considerations security concerns remain despite the presence of some \nmitigation. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service and particularly his deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n05/08/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 17, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on January 15, 2019, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 15, 2019. The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 12, \n2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 16, 2019. The Government offered \n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GE) 1 through 6.1 Applicant testified and did not offer any exhibits. There were \nno objections and GE 1 through 6 were admitted into evidence. The record remained \nopened until May 2, 2019, to permit Applicant an opportunity to provide documents. He \ndid not provide any documents and the record closed. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on April 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and admitted the allegation \nin \u00b6 1.c. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served on active duty in the military from 1991 until \nhe retired honorably in 2011. He married in 1993 and has a grown daughter. He divorced \nin 1998. He remarried in 1999 and divorced in 2011. There were no children from this \nmarriage. He has worked for a federal contractor since 2011.2 \n \n \nApplicant and his first wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1994 and their debts were \ndischarged the same year. Applicant and his second wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nAugust 2000. It was converted to Chapter 7 in 2002, and their debts were discharged in \n2003. In 2005, Applicant and his wife purchased a house and secured two mortgages. \nApplicant claimed his wife had a spending problem. While he worked overseas, he would \nreturn home and would notice large purchases had been made.3  \n \n \nIn August 2007, Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which included \na payment plan for the two mortgages (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($77,623) and 1.b ($22,768)) that \nwere in arrears. They did not complete the terms of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy because \nthey filed for divorce. The divorce decree terms stated that Applicant would make the \nmortgage payments through September 2011. His wife was granted exclusive possession \nof the house until their bankruptcy discharge or she refinanced it by May 2014. If the wife \ncould not refinance the mortgages or was 30 days or more late on a payment, then the \nhouse would be sold and the proceeds of the sale were to be split. Applicant would be \nresponsible for the mortgage payments during the pendency of the sale of the house or \nif the wife refinanced the home by May 1, 2014. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy was \ndismissed in November 2011 for failure to make payments.4  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was he had no idea when his wife moved out of the house. \nHe said the house was sold, but he had no idea when or the amount it was sold for. He \nsaid after his divorce, his ex-wife filed bankruptcy. His understanding was the debts in \n                                                          \n1 Hearing Exhibit I is a demonstrative exhibit.  \n \n2 Tr. 17-20, 24; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. 20-23; GE 2. \n \n4 Tr. 25; GE 2, 5, 6. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were charged off. He believed that meant they were gone. He said \nhe now understands the mortgages or a portion were not paid. When asked if he had any \nintention of paying the debts, he stated \u201cProbably not, Your Honor. It\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d5 \nHe said his ex-wife surrendered the house in her bankruptcy, and the debts were charged \noff. He said he reached out to the creditors in 2012 regarding keeping the house, but they \nwere unwilling to work with him because of his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy. He was aware in \n2012 that the debts were on his credit report. Applicant never followed up on the status \nof the two mortgages or his financial responsibility to the creditors.6 \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2016. In it \nhe disclosed the mortgage debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He stated that the house was \nawarded in his divorce to his ex-wife with a contingency that she refinance it in her name. \nHe said she subsequently filed bankruptcy and surrendered the property. He was \nattempting to remove the debt from his credit report. He did not provide evidence of what \nhe did.7  \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s March 2018 background investigation, he told the government \ninvestigator that his ex-wife was supposed to pay for the mortgages, but she defaulted on \nthe loans. He said the loans were in both of their names. He was given time by the \ninvestigator to produce documents regarding his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but did not.8  \n \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview, he was confronted with the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. He told the investigator that this was an energy bill. He said he checks his credit \nreport once a week, and this debt was not on it. He was given time to produce supporting \ndocumentation to the investigator and did not. He said he would inquire about the account. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the debt in \u00b6 1.c. At this hearing, he denied \nthe debt and said he was contesting it.9  \n \n \nA credit report from October 2016 reports the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a as charged off in \nDecember 2013. It reports the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b as past due in the amount of $1,915. A \ncredit report from June 2018 reports the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a as charged off and the debt in \n\u00b6 1.b as in collection.10 \n \n \nApplicant was provided an opportunity to provide documents to show the current \nstatus of the mortgage debts and whether he owed any deficiency. He did not provide \n                                                          \n5 Tr. 26. \n \n6 Tr. 23, 25-37. \n \n7 Tr. 28-37; GE 1. \n \n8 GE 2. \n \n9 Tr. 41-43; GE 2. \n \n10 GE 3, 4. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nany information. He did not provide any documents to dispute the debts in the SOR or \nproof of payment.11  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n                                                          \n11 Tr. 42-44. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts began accruing in about 2013. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on two debts associated with mortgages he and his wife \nobtained to purchase a house in 2005. They went through a divorce and the decree \ndetailed how the house would be dealt with. Applicant\u2019s testimony was that he believed \nthat when a debt was charged off he was no longer responsible for it. The debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a was charged off. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is in collection. He told the government \ninvestigator he was going to get one of the debts removed from his credit report. He did \nnot provide evidence of any action he took to determine the current status of these debts. \nIt is unknown if there was a deficiency or if the mortgages were satisfied through his ex-\nwife\u2019s bankruptcy or when the house sold. Both debts remain on his credit report. He \nadmitted and then denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The record was held open to allow him \nto provide substantiating evidence that he is no longer responsible for any of the debts. \nHe failed to do so. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because the current status or resolution \nwas not provided.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce was beyond his control. For the application of AG \u00b6 20(b) he \nmust have acted responsibly under the circumstances. He failed to do so. His divorce \ndecree detailed his responsibility regarding the house. Applicant did not provide evidence \nof his actions or that he acted responsibly. Despite owning the house jointly, he did not \nfollow up on his financial obligation toward the mortgages they secured after his ex-wife\u2019s \nbankruptcy or after the house sold. Applicant indicated he would contact the creditor in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c during his background interview, but failed to provide evidence of his actions \nto resolve this debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n \n \nThe evidence does not support the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d). There is \nno evidence Applicant has received financial counseling or has made a good-faith effort \nto repay the overdue creditors. Applicant was confronted with the relatively small debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c during his background interview. He was going to contact the creditor to \nresolve it. He admitted the debt in answer to the SOR, but denied it at his hearing. He did \n\n \n7 \n \n \nnot provide evidence that he has disputed or resolved this debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not \napply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 46 years old. He served in the military and retired honorably. He has \na history of financial problems beginning when his debts were discharged in Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 1994 and again in 2002. He then filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007, but \nit was not completed because he and his wife filed for divorce. Their mortgage debts were \nincluded in the divorce decree. Applicant failed to follow up on his responsibilities \nassociated with the debts after his ex-wife filed bankruptcy. He was provided an \nopportunity to produce evidence to corroborate that he is no longer responsible for any of \nthe debts alleged. He may not be responsible for one or both of the mortgages, but he \nfailed to provide evidence to make this determination. He also failed to provide evidence \nthat he disputed or paid the small debt alleged. The record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

He \nintentionally failed to disclose his delinquent debts on his June 7, 2017 Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) Financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. Access to classified information is denied.        \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 7, 2017, Applicant completed and signed his SCA. On October 4, 2018, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nJanuary 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and \nE (personal conduct). \n \nOn February 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. \n(HE 3) On March 18, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On April 5, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to another administrative judge, and on May 5, 2019, the case was \ntransferred to me for administrative reasons. On May 9, 2019, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for May 28, \n2019. (HE 1) Applicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled.  \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits; Applicant\u2019s only \nobjection went to the weight of the evidence, and not to admissibility; and all proffered \nexhibits were admitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 15-18; GE 1-5). Applicant noted that \nthe $740 debt on the court record from 2012 was not listed on the credit report he reviewed. \n(Tr. 16-17; SOR \u00b6 1.a; GE 4) Applicant did not offer any exhibits. (Tr. 10) Applicant said \nhe wanted to provide documentation after his hearing. (Tr. 56-57) On June 5, 2019, DOHA \nreceived a transcript of the hearing. On June 28, 2019, the record closed. (Tr. 57-58) \nApplicant did not provide any post-hearing documents.   \n \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, and he \neither denied the other SOR allegations or provided extenuating and mitigating \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings \nof fact follow.  \n \nApplicant is 45 years old, and a DOD contractor has continuously employed him \nas an audio-visual technician for the previous six years. (Tr. 6-7, 19, 21) In 1992, he \ngraduated from high school. (Tr. 6) He needs to complete five classes to receive a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in information technology. (Tr. 6) He has never served in the military. \n(Tr. 7) He has never been married. (Tr. 7) His two children are ages 20 and 25. (Tr. 7) He \nhas two grandchildren. (Tr. 20) Applicant provides some financial assistance to his \nchildren and grandchildren. (Tr. 20-21)  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $55,000. (Tr. 22) He has not had any periods \nof unemployment in the previous 10 years. (Tr. 22) He has about $35,000 in his 401(k) \naccount and about $2,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 44) Applicant was unsure about \nhow much discretionary income he had to pay his debts. (Tr. 45-46) Several debts were \ndropped from his credit report due to the passage of time. (Tr. 48) \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n                                         \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling $49,152. Their status is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a judgment was filed against Applicant in March 2012 for $808. \nApplicant said the debt was from daycare for his son, and it is at least 12 years old. (Tr. \n25-26) At first he said the debt was paid, and then he said it was not paid. (Tr. 25-26) He \nhas not contacted the creditor. (Tr. 26) He has not paid the debt because \u201cit just went off \n[of his] credit report.\u201d (Tr. 27) He is unsure of the status of the debt. (Tr. 27)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off debt for $21,036. The debt resulted from the \nvoluntary repossession of Applicant\u2019s vehicle. (Tr. 28) He purchased the vehicle in 2014 \nor 2015, and he believed the amount of the debt was the amount of his loan. (Tr. 28) He \nmade payments for about one year, and then he decided \u201cit wasn\u2019t worth it,\u201d and he \nstopped making payments. (Tr. 29) After he received the SOR, he asked the creditor \nabout the debt. (Tr. 30) The creditor responded that they would investigate the debt. (Tr. \n30) He was unable to learn the current holder of the debt and the amount owed. (Tr. 30) \nHe has not made any progress resolving this debt. (Tr. 31) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a debt that is past due in the amount of $1,009 with a total \nbalance of $5,191. Applicant said the debt was current, and he owed one final payment \nof $340. (Tr. 32) He said he would provide proof of payment after his hearing. (Tr. 32) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a debt for $4,159 which was placed for collection. Applicant said \nthe debt resulted from an apartment rental. (Tr. 33-37) Applicant was behind on the rent, \nand he left without paying what he owed. (Tr. 34) On December 12, 2018, the creditor \noffered to settle the debt for $1,247. (Tr. 34; HE 3 at 8) Applicant said he was paying $60 \nmonthly to address the debt. (Tr. 35) He estimated that he still owed about $700 to pay \nthis debt. (Tr. 35) He said he had documentation at home to support payment. (Tr. 36)     \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a charged-off debt for $3,470. In the beginning of 2017, \nApplicant purchased furniture on credit. (Tr. 37) He made six or seven payments, and \nthen he stopped paying. (Tr. 38) He had no idea why he stopped making payments, and \nhe suggested that he \u201clost track\u201d of the debt. (Tr. 38) On December 28, 2018, the creditor \nwrote that the debt was currently $600, and it had to be paid no later than February 1, \n2019, to qualify for the $700 settlement. (HE 3 at 9) Applicant had paid $100 to address \nthe debt. (HE 3 at 9) Applicant said he had a payment arrangement with the creditor, and \nhe was paying $50 a month. (Tr. 39-40)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a telecommunications debt for $473 which was placed for \ncollection. Applicant said he paid the debt last year. (Tr. 40) However, he did not provide \nproof of payment.   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a utilities debt for $189 which was placed for collection. On \nDecember 14, 2018, Applicant paid this debt. (Tr. 41; HE 3 at 10) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a charged-off debt for $13,221. Around 2000, Applicant \nborrowed funds to purchase a truck. (Tr. 43) Applicant was unemployed for about six \nmonths in 2003, and he was unable to make payments to address the truck loan. (Tr. 43) \n\n \n4 \n                                         \n \nHis truck was repossessed. (Tr. 43) He did not make any payments after the truck was \nrepossessed, and eventually the debt was dropped from his credit report. (Tr. 43-44) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a telecommunications debt for $605 which was placed for \ncollection. Applicant settled the debt by making a $181 payment. (Tr. 42; HE 3 at 12-13) \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR does not include information about delinquent student loans. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report states he owes about $89,000 in student loans. (Tr. 55; GE 3 at \n9) Applicant said his student loan payments were deferred for the previous five years. (Tr. \n55) He said he planned to return to school, and he was not asked by the creditors for a \nreason for deferment. (Tr. 55-56) I requested that he provide documentation showing the \nbasis for the deferment of his student loans after his hearing (Tr. 57); however, he did not \nprovide any documentation after his hearing supporting his claim of deferment of his \nstudent loans. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal \nBoard listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be \nconsidered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \nId. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-\n0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)). See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApril 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). I did not consider the allegations of \nnon-SOR delinquent student loans or improperly deferred student loans for any purpose \nin this case as the record was not developed sufficiently to determine the status of his \nstudent loans. \n \nApplicant submitted a letter from his representative indicating he was in the \nprocess of challenging the negative entries on Applicant\u2019s credit report. (HE 3 at 7) His \nrepresentative found numerous errors on Applicant\u2019s credit report; however, the \nrepresentative did not indicate any of the SOR debts were listed in error on the credit \nreports the government provided. (HE 3 at 7; GE 2; GE 3) \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s June 7, 2017 SCA asks whether in the previous seven years, Applicant \nhad any judgments entered against him, any property repossessed, defaulted on any \nloans, debts turned over to a collection agency, accounts charged off, or debts over 120 \ndays delinquent. (GE 1) Applicant answered, no, to all questions pertaining to negative \nfinancial information. (GE 1)  \n \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege Applicant had judgments entered against him in March \n2012 and January 2014 and the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, and that he \nfailed to disclose them on his June 7, 2017 SCA. In his SOR response, Applicant admitted \nthese two SOR allegations. (HE 3) He understood the question and he knew he had \nreportable negative financial information. (Tr. 48-53) He did not have a credible \nexplanation for why he did not disclose his delinquent debts. (Tr. 48-53)  \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(b) unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c).  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \nSeven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue;  \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 2016)). \n \nApplicant had a six-month period of unemployment in 2003, and this \nunemployment was outside of his control and adversely affected his finances. He is \ncredited with mitigating the following SOR allegations: \u00b6 1.e because he has an \nestablished payment plan; \u00b6 1.g because he provided proof of payment; and \u00b6 1.i because \nhe provided proof of payment.    \n \n  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts:  \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \nApplicant did not provide documentation relating to most of his SOR debts such \nas: (1) proof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of \nchecks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the \ncreditor; (2) correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact;  \n(3) copies of credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies \nindicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a \nbelief; (4) evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers \nor agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve this debt; or (5) other evidence \nof progress or resolution. \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports indicate that several of his debts are in charged-off \nstatus. Eventually the charged-off debts will be dropped from his credit report. \u201c[T]hat \nsome debts have dropped off his credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. \n14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal \nof most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of \ndelinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer.  Debts may be dropped from a credit report upon dispute \n\n \n9 \n                                         \n \nwhen creditors believe the debt is not going to be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond \nto a credit reporting company\u2019s request for information, or when the debt has been \ncharged off. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide more evidence of debt resolution precludes \nmitigation of the charged-off debts on his credit report. \n \nThere is insufficient evidence about why Applicant was unable to make greater \nprogress sooner resolving his SOR debts. There is insufficient assurance his financial \nproblems are resolved, under control, and will not recur in the future. Under all the \ncircumstances, he failed to establish that financial considerations security concerns are \nmitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n AG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations, . . . \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness. . . .\u201d \n \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating:  \n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \n \nApplicant\u2019s June 17, 2017 SCA asked five questions relating to his finances in the \nlast seven years: (1) did he have a judgment entered against him; (2) did he have any \ncharged-off accounts; (3) has he had any property repossessed; (4) has he had any debts \n\n \n10 \n                                         \n \nturned over to a collection agency; and (5) has he been over 120 days delinquent on any \ndebt. He answered, no, to all five questions, when his answers should have been, yes. \nHe understood the questions, and he was well aware of his financial problems, especially \nrelating to his repossessed vehicles and debts over 120 days delinquent. AG \u00b6 16(a) is \nestablished. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this \ncase: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s intentional false statement \nabout his finances on his SCA. His false statement is recent, serious, and deliberate. He \nfailed to meet his burden of mitigating this conduct.  \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is 45 years old, and a DOD contractor has continuously employed him \nas an audio-visual technician for the previous six years. In 1992, he graduated from high \nschool. He needs to complete five classes to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree in information \ntechnology. His two children are ages 20 and 25. He has two grandchildren. Applicant \nprovides some financial assistance to his children and grandchildren.   \n \nApplicant mitigated three SOR allegations: \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i. The remaining six \nSOR allegations total $44,888, and they were not mitigated. He did not provide proof of \nany payments, established payment plans, or other mitigation in relation to these six \ndebts. Applicant was not truthful on his June 7, 2017 SCA about his delinquent debts. He \nknowingly failed to disclose his delinquent debts and financial problems.  \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the granting a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations and \npersonal conduct security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \n \n\n \n12 \n                                         \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c,   \n    1.d, 1.f, and 1.h:  \n  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i: For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 11, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on November 3, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On December 20, 2018, \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on January 11, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled on \nFebruary 25, 2019.  \nEvidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C, which \nwere admitted without objection. \n03/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Afghanistan. Without objection, I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the request. The facts are summarized in the written request and will not \nbe repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is that the risk of terrorist \nactivities in Afghanistan remains extremely high. No section of Afghanistan is safe or \nimmune from violence, and the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, \ntargeted or random, against U.S. and other Western nationals at any time. The \ncountry\u2019s human rights record remains poor. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2013. He was born in Afghanistan to Afghan parents. His \nfamily fled to Pakistan in 1984 to avoid the war. They returned to Afghanistan in about \n2004. He was granted asylum in the United States in 2010 because of threats made \nagainst his family. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.1 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is deceased. His mother is a citizen of Afghanistan, currently \nresiding in the United States with Applicant. He used to send her money through a \nfriend in Afghanistan, but he stopped in about 2017. He has ten brothers and sisters. \nEight of his siblings live in European countries. He has a brother and a sister who are \ncitizens and residents of Afghanistan. His sister is a widow who does not work outside \nthe home. His brother is in school. Applicant also still has a few friends in Afghanistan. \nNone of his family in Afghanistan have any direct connection to the Afghanistan \ngovernment or any terrorist organization.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e is a U.S. citizen originally from Afghanistan. She is pregnant \nwith their first child. He does not own any assets in Afghanistan. He and a partner invest \ntogether in flipping houses in the United States.3 \n \n \nApplicant worked as a language instructor on a U.S. military installation from \n2011 to 2013. He has worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist with the U.S. \nmilitary in Afghanistan since 2014. He does not see his family when he is working in \nAfghanistan. He will occasionally call his family, but he does not tell them that he is \nworking in Afghanistan. He credibly testified that his family in Afghanistan could not be \nused to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.4   \n \n \nApplicant received a letter and certificates of appreciation from U.S. military \npersonnel in Afghanistan. The U.S. personnel recognized Applicant for how his linguistic \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 19-21, 30-33; GE 1-4. \n \n2 Tr. at 24-28, 36-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4. \n \n3 Tr. at 26-29, 40-41. \n \n4 Tr. at 21-24, 27, 29-30, 33-36; GE 1-4; AE A-C. \n\n \n3 \n \nskills, positive attitude, work ethic, and dedication increased their units\u2019 readiness and \ncontributed to the success of their mission.5   \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n                                                          \n5 AE A-C. \n\n \n4 \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, siblings, and some friends are citizens of Afghanistan. Two of \nhis siblings and his friends are residents of Afghanistan. The potential for terrorist \nviolence against U.S. interests and citizens remains high in Afghanistan, and it \ncontinues to have human rights problems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential \nconflict of interest and a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, and coercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence.  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Afghanistan. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, the country is known to \nconduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the foreign country is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in \nAfghanistan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified \ninformation. The Appeal Board has held that such a statement, standing alone, is of \nlimited value, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar \nmanner in the past in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous \ntrack record of complying with security regulations and procedures in the context of \ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the \nnational security.6 In ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the \nAppeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \n                                                          \n6 ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). \n\n \n6 \n \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist with the U.S. military \nin Afghanistan since 2014. He was recognized by U.S. military personnel for how his \nlinguistic skills, positive attitude, work ethic, and dedication increased their units\u2019 \nreadiness and contributed to the success of their mission. I find that Applicant can be \nexpected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 \n8(a) is applicable to his relatives who are residing in the United States and Europe. AG \n\u00b6 8(b) is applicable to all of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. military in Afghanistan earned him praise from \nU.S. military personnel. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of \naction in defense of the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable \nresult for an applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d7 The complicated state of affairs in \nAfghanistan places a significant burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that \nhis foreign family members do not pose an unacceptable security risk. He has met that \nburden.  \n                                                          \n7 ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). \n\n \n7 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 51, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, since June 1994. Applicant claims to have had a security clearance prior to the issuance of the SOR, but this information is not otherwise confirmed in the record. He completed a security clearance application in December 2016. He affirmatively answered the question about seeking credit counseling to resolve his debt, but he did not list any delinquent accounts. The ensuing investigation revealed that Applicant owes $21,141 in delinquent accounts. (GE 3-8; AE A.) The debts alleged in the SOR became delinquent between 2013 and 2017. Applicant, a father of four, blames his financial problems on the difficulty of raising four children. Two of the children lived with Applicant, and he paid $701 in child support each month.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n08/28/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nNOEL, Nichole L., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate security concerns related \nto his unresolved delinquent debts. Clearance is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 15, 2019, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017.  DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision without a hearing. \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 2.) The Government submitted its written case on April 19, \n2019. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) and the Directive were \nprovided to Applicant. He received the FORM on April 25, 2019, and provided a \n\n \n2 \n \nresponse. The attachments to the FORM are admitted to the record as GE 1 through 8, \nand Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, without \nobjection.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 51, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, since \nJune 1994. Applicant claims to have had a security clearance prior to the issuance of \nthe SOR, but this information is not otherwise confirmed in the record. He completed a \nsecurity clearance application in December 2016. He affirmatively answered the \nquestion about seeking credit counseling to resolve his debt, but he did not list any \ndelinquent accounts. The ensuing investigation revealed that Applicant owes $21,141 in \ndelinquent accounts. (GE 3-8; AE A.) \n \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR became delinquent between 2013 and 2017.  \nApplicant, a father of four, blames his financial problems on the difficulty of raising four \nchildren. Two of the children lived with Applicant, and he paid $701 in child support \neach month. However, he did not point to any specific event that caused him to incur \nthe delinquent accounts.  On his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that \nhe was working with Lexington Law to address his delinquent accounts. In his October \n2017 subject interview, Applicant stated that he switched to another credit repair \nprogram, but admitted that he did not make any payments under either program. (GE 3-\n8.) \n \n \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant indicated that his finances have \ncontinued to deteriorate. Applicant reported that his employer reduced his hourly wage \nby $9 per hour and told him that he would be terminated if he was unable to retain his \nsecurity clearance. In addition to his decrease in pay, Applicant and his wife of 10 years \nare in the process of divorcing. It is unclear how the dissolution of the marriage will \naffect his finances. (AE A.) \n \n \nSOR admits the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, and 1.e \u2013 1.i. He denied the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b claiming that he did not know the origin of the debt. He also denies the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d., which are duplicate accounts related to cable \nequipment. Applicant claims that he returned the boxes, and would resolve the issue \nwith the cable company. However, he did not provide any corroborating documentation.  \nTo date, all of the SOR debts remain unresolved. (GE 2, 4.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \n\n \n3 \n \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence. \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \n\u201csatisfy debts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18).  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $21,000 in unresolved delinquent \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports in the record support the \nGovernment\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant has a history of not meeting his financial \nobligations and an inability to repay his creditors. Financial considerations disqualifying \nconditions 19(a) and (c) apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial concerns raised \nby his delinquent accounts. He failed to establish that his financial problems were \ncaused by events beyond his control. His financial problems are ongoing and the debts \nremain unresolved. None of the financial considerations mitigating conditions apply.  \n  \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant failed to meet his burdens of production and \npersuasion to refute or mitigate the financial considerations concerns raised in the SOR.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c, 1.e \u2013 1.i: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n                                               \n \n \n________________________ \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant timely answered the SOR \nand elected to have his case decided on the written record.  \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material \n(FORM) on December 20, 2018.

It is \nunclear what progress has been made on this debt because no documentation has \nbeen provided.  Applicant has provided no explanation or documentary evidence either \nwith his Answer to the SOR or in response to the FORM. Applicant admitted to all of the \nother SOR delinquent debts, and they are confirmed in his credit reports. He provided \nno evidence of financial counseling or budget showing income against expenses. \n \n \n \n                                            Policies \n \n \nThis action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Administrative Guidelines (AGs) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.  \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s May 26, 2017 \nSecurity Clearance Application (SCA) (Item 3).  \n \n2 Item 3.  \n \n3 Item 3, p. 28. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions. \n \nThese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process \nis an examination of a sufficient period and a careful weighing of a number of variables \nof an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the individual is an \nacceptable security risk. This is known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses \nand other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \n\n \n4 \n \n \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following \napply here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit \nreports and answer to the SOR. The Government produced substantial evidence to \nsupport the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.4  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;     \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \n                                                          \n4 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n5 \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \n \n \nApplicant has not provided any explanation how he became delinquent on these \ndebts in the first place, other than his spouse\u2019s business losses, or what he is doing \nabout them going forward. He has not identified any circumstances or conditions that \nwere beyond his control. He has produced no relevant or responsive documentation \neither with his Answer to the SOR, or in response to the FORM. He has not \ndemonstrated that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has the \nburden to provide sufficient evidence to show that his financial problems are under \ncontrol, and that his debts were incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to \nrecur. Applicant has not met that burden.  \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s credit reports and the \nSOR list 10 delinquent debts totaling $12,305. Applicant did not provide enough details \nwith documentary corroboration about what he did to address his SOR debts. He did not \nprovide documentation relating to any of the SOR debts: (1) proof of payments, such as \nchecking account statements, photocopies of checks, or a letter from the creditor \nproving that he paid or made any payments to the creditors; (2) correspondence to or \nfrom the creditors to establish maintenance of contact;5 (3) credible debt disputes \nindicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debts and why he held such a \nbelief; (4) more evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, such as settlement \noffers or agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve these debts; or (5) other \nevidence of progress or resolution. Applicant failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(e) because he did not provide documented proof to substantiate the existence, \nbasis, or the result of any debt disputes. \n \n \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel informed Applicant that it was important for \nhim to provide corroborating or supporting documentation of resolution of the debts in \nthe SOR. (FORM at 3) Aside from Applicant\u2019s uncorroborated statements, there is no \ndocumentary evidence that Applicant paid, arranged to pay, settled, compromised, or \n                                                          \n5 \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances outside \nhis [or his] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable \nmanner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. \n12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or he maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current.  \n\n \n6 \n \n \notherwise resolved any of the SOR debts. He did not provide his budget. The record \nlacks corroborating or substantiating documentation and detailed explanations of the \ncauses for his financial problems and other mitigating information.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes\u2026.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nSince Applicant admitted his intent to provide false information as alleged at SOR \n\u00b6 2.a, his intent is not an issue. Applicant responded negatively when asked if he had \nany delinquencies regarding routine accounts in the last seven years in section 26 of his \nSCA (Financial). He only disclosed one debt that was more than 120 days past due. \nThe wording of the questions in section 26 of his SCA could not be more straightforward \nand unambiguous. He disclosed only one delinquent credit-card debt owed to a bank in \nhis SCA. Applicant did not answer the SCA questions honestly. I conclude that he had \nthe specific intent to deceive when he provided false answers in section 26, and he \ndeliberately falsified the SCA. This deliberate falsification has not been mitigated.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under those guidelines. Notably, Applicant has not persuasively \naddressed the specific allegations in the SOR. He has not met his burden of production.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude that Applicant\u2019s financial problems are under control. The record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nDam, Shari, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under the guideline for \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, relating to his illegal use of marijuana and \nprescription drugs. He used marijuana after receiving a security clearance. Based upon \na review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility is denied.  \nStatement of Case \nOn October 9, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on October 17, 2018, and requested his case be decided by an \nadministrative judge on the written record without a hearing.   \nOn November 18, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing three Items, \nwas mailed to Applicant and received by him on November 28, 2018. The FORM notified \nApplicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not \nrespond to the FORM or object to Items 1 through 3. Hence, all Items are admitted into \n03/05/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \nevidence. On February 7, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me.  \n \nFindings of Fact  \n \n \nApplicant admitted the five SOR allegations contained in Paragraph 1. (Item 1) His \nadmissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 24 years old, a college graduate, and unmarried. He has worked for a \ndefense contractor since August 2017. He received an interim security clearance in \nOctober 2017. (Items 1, 2)  \n \n \nIn August 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86). In it \nhe disclosed the following information related to past illegal drug use: he illegally used \nwith varying frequency marijuana between June 2012 and January 2018; he purchased \nmarijuana from September 2013 to April 2016; he used cocaine once in 2014; and he \nmisused two prescriptions, Adderall and Vyvanse, from November 2013 to December \n2014, while in college. During a background interview in March 2018, Applicant admitted \nthat he illegally used marijuana in early January 2018, after having received an interim \nsecurity clearance in October 2017. He said he used marijuana for social reasons and \ntook the prescription drugs to help him study while in college. He used marijuana with \nfriends. (Item 3) \n \n \nDuring the March 2018 interview, Applicant stated he does not intend to use illegal \ndrugs or marijuana in the future. (Item 3) There is no information indicating that Applicant \nhas participated in treatment for substance abuse or other information confirming that he \nno longer illegally uses marijuana or other drugs; or that he no longer associates with \npeople who use illegal drugs. No other relevant information was provided by Applicant. \n \n \nPolicies \n \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG), which became effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concerns related to this guideline: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Three are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);   \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n \n \nApplicant illegally used marijuana from 2012 to 2018 and purchased it from 2013 \nto 2016. He used marijuana after he received an interim security clearance in October \n2017. He illegally used cocaine and prescription medication between 2013 and 2014. The \nevidence raised the above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. They are as follows: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; and \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use occurred from 2012 to 2018 and \noccurred with sufficient frequency to raise ongoing concerns about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. The evidence does not establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 26(a). Applicant honestly disclosed and acknowledged his history of illegal \ndrug and marijuana use. In March 2018, he said he did not intend to use illegal substances \nin the future. However, that statement is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 26(b) because there is no evidence to substantiate that he has taken actions to stop \nusing marijuana or other illegal drugs; that he has established a pattern of abstinence; or \nthat he no longer associates with friends with whom he used drugs. Applicant used \nprescription medications that were not prescribed for him. There is no evidence his \nmisuse was related to an illness. AG \u00b6 26(c) does not apply. Applicant has neither \nsuccessfully participated in nor completed a substance abuse treatment program, as \nrequired to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(d). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant honestly and voluntarily disclosed to the Government his history of \nabusing marijuana and prescription drugs. He stated in March 2018 that he does not \nintend to use marijuana or other drugs in the future. While his disclosure and statement \nare some evidence that he is committed to not engaging in similar misconduct in the \nfuture, they are insufficient to conclude that he has successfully overcome his long-term \nuse of illegal drugs. In August 2017, Applicant completed his SF-86, which put him on \nnotice that any illegal drug use was a security concern. He was subsequently granted an \ninterim security clearance and continued to illegally use marijuana. Although some of his \nconduct may be attributable to youthful indiscretion, Applicant\u2019s decision to use marijuana \nafter he received an interim security clearance is recent, and raises questions about his \npresent judgement and commitment to not use illegal drugs in the future. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nHe did not meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline \nfor drug involvement and substance misuse. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n    AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n     Subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \n           Against Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

(GE 3) She had purchased a car but \nthen became unemployed, and the car was repossessed. Applicant explained that she \nhad chosen to pay her mortgage and could not afford the car payments. (Tr. 24) She \nhad a debt-consolidation loan, but had to stop making payments due to the lower salary. \nShe also had medical bills and household bills. Applicant realized that she could not \nmake payments on these items and provide for her three children on one income. She \ncontacted an attorney in late 2017, and he advised that she file for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy to include all of her debts.

She received financial \ncounseling as part of her bankruptcy process. All of the debts listed on the SOR have \nbeen included in the bankruptcy. \nApplicant submitted letters of reference from her current supervisor and her \nformer supervisor, (AE E, F) who both praise her work ethic, trustworthiness and \nintegrity. Applicant is also praised for the variety of tasks that she has worked on, \nincluding some with sensitive information. She has followed the rules, policies and \nprocedures with respect to the information. Finally, Applicant is described as a loyal \nworker. \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for \naccess to sensitive information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is \nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case \ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or \ndenial of eligibility for a public trust position. Considering the SOR allegations and the \nevidence as a whole, the relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). \nTrustworthiness decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s public trust position. The \nGovernment must prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If it does, the burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the \nGovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a public trust position, the applicant \nbears a heavy burden of persuasion. \nPersons with access to sensitive information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any \nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.2 \n2 See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts started with \nunemployment and underemployment and the separation and loss of her significant \nother\u2019s income. She supported three children and paid her bills before the 2016 \nseparation. She sold her house and used some of the portion proceeds of her share to \nrent an apartment for her family. Her security deposit and rent increased. \nApplicant meets the mitigating conditions for financial considerations. given that \nshe sought legal advice and decided to file for bankruptcy. She found an attorney who \ncharged her a lesser fee and that took time. She paid $1,200 and filed the bankruptcy \npetition in January 2019. She explained this to her investigator during her 2018 \ninterview. The bankruptcy has been discharged. Applicant received financial counseling \nas part of that process. She has a budget and lives within her means. She does not take \nany vacations. 3 She experienced circumstances beyond her control, and acted \n4 \nresponsibly under the circumstances. She has full time employment.  Applicant has had\nfinancial counseling. She submitted proof of her bankruptcy discharge. This is a legal \nmeans to resolve debt. Her earlier credit report shows that she had the majority of her \naccounts \u201cpays as agreed.\u201d 5 Finally, she provided work and character evidence which \nsupports a whole-person assessment to overcome the trustworthiness concerns raised \nby his conduct. Accordingly, I conclude Guideline F for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a- 1.m: \nFor Applicant \n3\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur . . . \n4\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5\u00b620(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                              \n                                             \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a public trust \nposition for Applicant.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn December 31, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines E (personal \nconduct) and M (use of information technology). Applicant responded to the SOR on \nMarch 25, 2019, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on June 24, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on August 9, 2019. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence over Applicant\u2019s objection. The \nobjection to GE 4 was sustained. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A and B, which were admitted without objection.  \n \n \n \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer for almost two years. He served in the National Guard from 1976 \nto 1977, and on active duty in the U.S. military from 1977 until he was honorably \ndischarged in 1990. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held for an \nextended period. He attended college, but he has not earned a degree. He is married \nfor the second time. He has two children and a stepchild. (Transcript (Tr.) at 32-33; GE \n1) \n \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor at various locations for a number of \nyears. In about February 2016, he was permitted to resign in lieu of termination after his \nemployer discovered that he uploaded inappropriate materials onto the employer\u2019s \ncomputer system in violation of company policy. The uploaded materials included \nmovies, television programs, and some materials that had sexually explicit content. The \ncompany also believed he mischarged his labor by viewing those materials on company \ntime. (Tr. at 20, 24-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3) \n \nApplicant admitted that he resigned in lieu of termination, but he denied \nintentionally uploading sexually explicit materials. He asserted that his contract with the \ncompany was about to end, and he wanted to save some information for future use. He \nconnected a personal external hard drive to the company\u2019s computer system and \ncopied some information to the hard drive. He admitted that he listened to music and \nmovies through the external hard drive while he worked the third shift. He denied \nwatching movies while working. He asserted that his friends and co-workers uploaded \nthe sexually explicit materials on the personal hard drive without his knowledge while he \nwas working in Afghanistan, and that the materials must have been uploaded to the \ncompany\u2019s computer system by mistake. He also admitted that it was against company \npolicy to connect a personal external hard drive to the company\u2019s computer system. (Tr. \nat 20, 24-32; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nApril 2017. Under Section 13A \u2013 Employment Activities, he reported the job discussed \nabove that ended in February 2016. He intentionally provided false information when he \nwrote the reason for leaving the job as:  \n \nReceived a lay off letter in January 2016 from [Employer] and our jobs \nwould be finished at end of February 2016. I had an opportunity early in \nFeb. 2016 to go and work with a different U.S. company overseas. They \nwanted me to go as soon as possible, so I resigned from [Employer] to \ntake this job. But unfortunately someone else was picked for the position.   \n \nApplicant also intentionally provided false information on the SF 86 when he \nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to the following question: \n \nFor this employment have any of the following happened to you in the \nlast seven (7) years? \n\n \n3 \n \n\uf0b7 Fired \n\uf0b7 Quit after being told you would be fired \n\uf0b7 Left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct \n\uf0b7 Left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance \n \nApplicant provided an additional false statement when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nfollowing question under Section 27 \u2013 Use of Information Technology Systems: \n \nIn the last seven (7) years have you introduced, removed, or used \nhardware, software, or media in connection with any information \ntechnology system without authorization, when specifically prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or attempted any of the \nabove? \n \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in July 2018. He \nrepeated the lie that he voluntarily resigned from his employer in February 2016 to \npursue an opportunity overseas. When confronted with the facts about the resignation in \nlieu of termination, he continued his lie and stated that he did not commit any \nunfavorable conduct while working for the company. He denied misusing his employer\u2019s \ntechnology. \n \nApplicant admitted at the hearing that he was untruthful on the SF 86 and to the \nbackground investigator. He stated that his former employer told him that if he resigned \nthere would be no records of his being fired. (Tr. at 21-23, 35) \n \nApplicant submitted documents and a letter attesting to his excellent job \nperformance. He is praised for his technical knowledge and professionalism. (AE A) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \n  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n \n\n \n5 \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s  \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant intentionally provided false information about the circumstances \nsurrounding his resignation in lieu of termination on an April 2017 SF 86 and during a \nbackground interview in July 2018. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) are applicable.  \n \nApplicant violated his employer\u2019s policy when he connected a personal external \nhard drive to the company\u2019s computer. That conduct reflects questionable judgment and \nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable.  \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \n\n \n6 \n \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant lied on the SF 86 and during his background interview. I have doubts \nthat he was completely truthful at his hearing. Had he been honest from the beginning \nabout the circumstances surrounding his resignation in lieu of termination, that conduct \nwould likely have been mitigated. However, without complete candor, there are no \napplicable mitigating conditions and none of the conduct is mitigated.  \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \n \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and  \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant knew he was violating company policy when he connected a personal \nexternal hard drive to the company\u2019s computer system. The above disqualifying \nconditions are applicable.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the use of information technology systems security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.  \n \n \nThe above analysis under personal conduct also applies here. Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 41(a) is not applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service, his work overseas, and his favorable character \nevidence.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and use of information technology security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline M:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n\n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 1, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn January 8, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant. On January 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for February 14, \n2019. \n \nAt the hearing, two Government exhibits (GEs 1-2) were admitted. A December \n31, 2018 letter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant and a list of the GEs were \nmarked as hearing exhibits (HEs II-III) for the record but not admitted in evidence. At the \nGovernment\u2019s request and without objection from Applicant, I agreed to take \nadministrative notice of several facts pertinent to Lebanon, as set forth in a December 31, \n2018 Request for Administrative Notice-Lebanon, which was entered into the record as \nHE I.1 Fifteen Applicant exhibits (AEs A-O) were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \n \n \n2 \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen of Lebanon \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a); that his sister is a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon currently \nresiding in Lebanon and working for a Lebanese company (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that another sister \nis a resident citizen of Lebanon employed by an international organization (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \nthat a friend is a resident citizen of Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that a friend is a dual citizen \nof Lebanon and Mexico residing in Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Additionally, the SOR alleges \nthat Applicant owns an apartment valued at $80,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) in Lebanon, and that he \nco-owns two apartments valued at $95,000 and $50,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.j), an office \nvalued at $17,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and two bank accounts with deposits of $83,000 and \n$65,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i) in Lebanon. \n \n \nApplicant submitted a detailed response to the SOR allegations in which he \nsummarized that, while he inherited assets in Lebanon from his father, he issued a power \nof attorney to his mother to sell or dispose of his shares; that his sisters and mother are \nin Lebanon only because his two sisters are currently assigned there by their respective \nemployers, a U.S. company and an international humanitarian organization; that he does \nnot maintain any close or regular contact with friends in Lebanon; and that his security \n                                                 \n1 The Request for Administrative Notice\u2014Lebanon was based on four documents from the U.S. State \nDepartment: Lebanon 2017 Human Rights Report, issued April 20, 2018; Lebanon Travel Advisory, issued \nSeptember 4, 2018; Lebanon International Travel Information, issued September 14, 2018; and Country \nReports on Terrorism 2017, issued September 2018. Consistent with the administrative judge\u2019s obligation \nin Guideline B cases to make decisions to the greatest extent possible in the context of current political \nconditions in the country at issue (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007)), I have also \nreviewed the State Department\u2019s Lebanon 2018 Human Rights Report, which was issued on March 13, \n2019. For information about U.S.-Lebanon relations, I have reviewed the State Department\u2019s Fact Sheet \ndated July 30, 2018, U.S. Relations with Lebanon. The human rights report and the fact sheet may be \naccessed at www.state.gov. \n\n \n \n3 \nofficer and his supervisors attest to his responsibility, reliability, trustworthiness, and his \nloyalty to the United States. (Answer.) \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old systems engineer, who has worked for his current \nemployer, a defense contractor, since June 2017. He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for his duties. (GE 1; Tr. 33, 38.) \n \nApplicant was born to Lebanese citizens in the United States. He acquired \nderivative Lebanese citizenship from his father. (GEs 1-2.) He denies that he currently \nholds Lebanese citizenship (Tr. 37-38), although there is no evidence that he has taken \nsteps to formally renounce his Lebanese citizenship. (GE 2.) Applicant held a Lebanese \npassport, renewed in October 2013 for another five years, which he surrendered to his \nemployer with a request that it be destroyed. He signed a disposition certificate. (GE 1; \nAE C.) \n \nApplicant has two sisters, ages 28 (sister #1) and 27 (sister #2). Shortly after sister \n#1 was born in Lebanon, Applicant\u2019s parents came to the United States with the intention \nof joining his father\u2019s relatives in their business. (Tr. 73.) After sister #2 and Applicant \nwere born in the United States, Applicant\u2019s parents moved the family back to Lebanon for \na job opportunity for Applicant\u2019s father. Lebanese Christians, they resided in a Christian-\ndominated area of Lebanon. Applicant attended high school in Lebanon from September \n2009 to June 2012. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 55.) \n \nApplicant planned to attend college in the United States, but his father was \ndiagnosed with terminal cancer. (Tr. 41.) His father, who worked in real estate in Lebanon, \ndied in September 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 68.) In January 2013, Applicant enrolled in an \n\u201cAmerican systems school\u201d in Lebanon in January 2013. Applicant accelerated his \ncoursework and earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in Lebanon in \nDecember 2015. (AE H; Tr. 41.) In January 2016, Applicant, his mother, and sister #2 \ncame to the United States. Sister #1, who was already employed in Lebanon by an \ninternational humanitarian organization, came for a one-month vacation. (GE 1; Tr. 41-\n43.) Applicant held both U.S. and Lebanese passports at that time. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant pursued his master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering in the United \nStates from January 2016 to May 2017. Sister #2 enrolled in college here, and at their \nmother\u2019s urging, sister #1 took a leave of absence from her employer and came to the \nUnited States for studies in her chosen field. (GE 1; Tr. 43-44.) Sister #1 had a degree \nfrom a university in Lebanon. (Tr. 73-74.) \n \nIn February 2017, Applicant was offered a job with his current employer. (GE 2; \nAE C.) On March 12, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed that he was a dual \ncitizen of the United States and Lebanon, but he had surrendered his Lebanese passport \n\n \n \n4 \nto the defense contractor and requested its destruction. He had taken no action to \nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship. Among his foreign travel, he listed a trip to Lebanon \nfrom May 2016 to August 2016. Applicant disclosed that sister #2 was a dual citizen of \nthe United States and Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that his mother and sister #1 were Lebanese \ncitizens (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c); and that his mother and sisters were residing with him in the \nUnited States. Sister #1 and their mother had immigration petitions pending in the United \nStates since September 2016 and December 2016 under his sponsorship. Applicant also \ndisclosed that he had close and continuing contact with two foreign nationals within the \nlast seven years. He had occasional telephone contact to as recently as December 2016 \nwith a Lebanese resident citizen (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and with a dual citizen of Lebanon and \nMexico residing in Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Concerning foreign financial interests, Applicant \nlisted his co-ownership with his mother and siblings of assets in Lebanon inherited on his \nfather\u2019s death consisting of two apartments and an office valued at $95,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), \n$50,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.j), and $17,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.k), and two bank accounts worth \napproximately $83,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) and $65,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Applicant was sole owner \nof another apartment in Lebanon valued at $80,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), which \u201cwas written to \n[him] by [his] father when [he] was still a minor and prior to him passing away.\u201d (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant earned his master\u2019s degree in May 2017 with a 4.0 grade point average \non a 4.0 scale. (AEs H, K.) He started working for his employer in June 2017. (GE 2.) On \nDecember 4, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office \nof Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that he initially acquired his \nLebanese passport through his parents, and that it had been destroyed by his employer\u2019s \nsecurity office. He expressed that he had no intention of renewing it. He confirmed that \nhe holds dual citizenship with Lebanon and the United States, but he has no obligations \nto Lebanon and did not maintain his foreign citizenship to protect any foreign interest. He \nindicated that he would be willing to renounce his Lebanese citizenship if required. \nApplicant indicated that his mother had acquired U.S. permanent residency, but also that \nhis mother and sisters had returned to Lebanon. About the two Lebanese citizens listed \nas foreign contacts on his SF 86, Applicant stated that they did not have any affiliation \nwith a foreign government. He had no update to the information previously provided about \nhis assets in Lebanon. Applicant explained that he considered the financial assets to be \nhis parent\u2019s property, and he added that he was in the process of trying to move money \nfrom Lebanon to the United States. He denied any intention of returning to Lebanon \npermanently. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant obtained a U.S. passport in May 2012 with a scheduled expiration date \nin May 2022. In January 2017, he had to obtain a new U.S. passport because he changed \nhis name. (GEs 1-2.) On January 12, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed to obtain \ninformation about his passports and foreign travel. Applicant used his Lebanese passport \nto travel to Turkey in 2014 and to Lebanon because he felt it was safer using it rather than \nhis U.S. passport, although he used his U.S. passport when entering the United States. \nApplicant related that his allegiance is to the United States over other nations and that no \nforeign associates know that he is under consideration for a security clearance. (GE 2.) \n \n\n \n \n5 \nApplicant traveled to Lebanon in August 2018 on his U.S. passport to visit his \nmother and sisters and to divest himself of his inherited assets in Lebanon. On August \n26, 2018, he irrevocably waived his interest in the assets inherited from the estate of his \nfather and his right to inherit from his mother on her death. On August 30, 2018, he gave \na general power of attorney to his mother to represent him in any legal matter in Lebanon, \nincluding matters of real estate and banking, and to divest him of his ownership interests. \n(AE A; Tr. 33-34, 54.) Applicant attested that his mother took action to have him removed \nfrom all those foreign assets, but then stated, \u201cI do hope that my mom actually completed \nthe documents.\u201d (Tr. 58-59.) If he discovers that she has not done so, he plans to ask her \nto take him off the bank accounts. (Tr. 59.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother has never worked outside the home. (GE 1; Tr. 62.) She lives \noff the assets she inherited on her spouse\u2019s death. (Tr. 56.) She does not rent out the \nproperties and is waiting for the economy to improve in Lebanon before selling them. (Tr. \n67.) Applicant has a close relationship with his mother. They converse by telephone \nfrequently including as recently as the morning of Applicant\u2019s security clearance hearing. \nAs of February 2019, Applicant\u2019s mother and sister #2 were living together in Lebanon. \n(Tr. 63.) Applicant testified that his mother intends to obtain U.S. citizenship and live \npermanently in the United States, but that she plans to stay in Lebanon \u201cat least [until] \none of [his sisters] actually comes back.\u201d He testified that his mother does not want to \nleave both of his sisters alone in Lebanon, and that there is no date set for his sisters\u2019 \nemployments to end in Lebanon. (Tr. 50-51.) Applicant understands that there are \nsecurity issues in Lebanon. In the event of any attempt to pressure him, such as through \nhis mother were she to be kidnapped, Applicant responded that his first reaction would \nbe to inform his security officer at work and seek guidance. (Tr. 61.) \n \nAccording to Applicant, sister #1\u2019s initial request for U.S. permanent residency has \nbeen approved. (Tr. 46.) As an employee of an international humanitarian organization \nsince 2010 or 2011, sister # 1 has been posted in Lebanon, but she had traveled to other \ncountries for her work involving refugees. She is always escorted by security staff when \nshe leaves her work premises. (Tr. 34, 37, 46-47.) Applicant has occasional contact with \nhis sister #1, approximately once a month to once every two months by telephone. Sister \n# 1 is married, and her spouse works in real estate. (Tr. 48-49.) Sister #1 and her spouse \nlive above Applicant\u2019s mother and sister #2 in the same building in Lebanon. (Tr. 63.) \nApplicant was not asked about, and he provided no details, about his sister\u2019s marriage, \nto include when it occurred or how it affects her plan to immigrate to the United States. \n \nSister #2 graduated from college in the United States. (Tr. 35.) She is a civil \nengineer and works for a U.S. company. She is presently assigned to duties in Lebanon \nbecause she speaks Arabic. Sister #2 is considering applying for work with Applicant\u2019s \nemployer in the United States. (Tr. 35-36.) \n \nApplicant testified that when he completed his SF 86, he realized that his foreign \ncontacts could be a security concern, and he resolved to have no further contact with the \nfriends (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). (Tr. 52-53.) Applicant has friendly relations with his father\u2019s \ncousins who live nearby in the United States. They are like uncles to him. He visits them \n\n \n \n6 \noccasionally and celebrates holidays with them. They have lived in the United States for \nseveral decades and own several businesses, including a restaurant and nightclub. (Tr. \n60, 69-71.) One of his relatives served on a city council in his community in the United \nStates. (Tr. 72.) Applicant has paternal aunts and uncles in Lebanon with whom he, his \nmother, and his sisters are not on good terms. (Tr. 68.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary with his defense-contractor employer is $80,000. \n(AE M; Tr. 61.) He has approximately $29,786 in banking deposits and $7,720 in a \nretirement account in the United States. (AEs I-J.) He attends church services weekly and \ncontributes financially to his parish. (AE L; Tr. 60.) He belongs to a sports club, where he \nplays soccer in a registered league with some co-workers. (AE O; Tr. 60.) He is also a \nmember of two professional organizations in his career field. (AE O.)  \n \nWork and Character References \n \n \nApplicant, who has no had access to classified information, is tasked with ensuring \ncompliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). (Tr. 39.) He has earned \nseveral awards at work for his accountability, and his collaboration on projects. (AE G.) A \nmechanical engineering manager, who has held a Secret clearance since April 2006, \nmanages all of Applicant\u2019s work assignments, reviews a large amount of his work product, \nand mentors him. This manager is aware of the SOR and has discussed the security \nconcerns with Applicant. He described Applicant as \u201ca model of honesty and integrity.\u201d \nApplicant has always been attentive to detail, completely trustworthy and accurate in his \nhandling of controlled technology, and transparent with information relative to his \napplication for a clearance. This manager has not observed anything about Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior to question his allegiance to the United States or his ability to protect classified \ninformation. He believes Applicant is \u201cfirst and foremost an American\u201d and dedicated to \nthe warfighter. (AE F.) \n \n \nA systems engineer who works on another project met Applicant when they were \nin graduate school together. They worked together daily on classwork. In his experience, \nApplicant was a \u201csmart and effective college student\u201d disciplined in his studies. Applicant \nexhibits respect for rules in all environments, and he has protected their employer\u2019s \nproprietary and intellectual property. In his opinion, Applicant takes his U.S. citizenship \nseriously. He has observed Applicant to honor U.S. war dead on Memorial Day and to \ncelebrate the U.S.\u2019 Independence Day \u201cin a truly American way.\u201d Applicant has expressed \nto him a desire to help the United States further its technology and promote scientific \nachievements. (AE E.) \n \n \nA principal systems engineer, who has worked for the defense contractor for some \n35 years and has held a Secret clearance for 30 years, also recommends Applicant for a \nDOD clearance. Applicant supports a program on which this engineer is the program lead \nby performing hardware systems assessments and classifications. This engineer has \nreviewed the SOR. He has experienced Applicant as someone who has always been \nreliable, responsible, and trustworthy. Applicant \u201cshows up earlier than asked, works hard, \nand carries himself in a polite, respectful manner.\u201d (AE B.) \n\n \n \n7 \n \nA senior security specialist at Applicant\u2019s worksite has held Secret or Top Secret \nsecurity clearances since 1987. She attests that Applicant approached her with a request \nto have his Lebanese passport destroyed, and he signed a disposition certificate. \nApplicant has been proactive in completing all security requirements ahead of schedule. \nHe has not given this security officer any reason to question his allegiance to the United \nStates or to believe that he has divided loyalties. Based on their professional interactions, \nshe is of the opinion that Applicant will not be manipulated, coerced, or induced into \nhelping a foreign power. (AE C.) \n \n \nA cousin of Applicant\u2019s father has worked in the United States since earning his \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1987. Employed as a senior program manager for a medical device \ncompany for the past 18 years, this relative has had the opportunity to interact with \nApplicant in the last three years. He was impressed by Applicant\u2019s dedication in his desire \nto earn highest grades in his master\u2019s degree studies. Applicant has shown himself to be \nvery honest and dependable, passionate about his work, and extremely motivated to \nsucceed in his job. He has no doubt that Applicant would put the interest of the United \nStates ahead of any other country. (AE D.) \n \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic that, from gaining its independence in 1943, \napportions government authority among a Maronite Christian president, a Shia speaker \nof its parliament, and a Sunni prime minister. After more than two years of political \ndeadlock, Lebanon\u2019s parliament elected President Michel Aoun. Parliamentary elections \nheld in May 2018 were peaceful and generally considered fair and free from regional \ninfluence. As of the end of 2018, the process of forming a government under the direction \nof Prime Minister designate Saad Hariri was underway. Neighboring Syria has long \ninfluenced Lebanon\u2019s foreign policy and internal policies. Hizballah\u2019s political power in \nLebanon makes consensus on any anti-Hizballah legislation impossible. \n \n \nThe United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon, and \nto help preserve its independence, sovereignty, national unity, and territorial integrity.  \nSince 2006, the United States has provided more than $2 billion in bilateral foreign \nassistance to Lebanon to support strengthening state institutions and security agencies \nafter years of Syrian hegemony; to bolster vital public services; to preserve the multi-\nsectarian character of Lebanon; and to counter Hizballah\u2019s influence and false narrative \nfor retaining its arms in Lebanon. Along with the international community, the United \nStates supports full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1559, \n1680, and 1701 for the disarming of all militias, delineation of the Lebanese-Syrian border, \nand the deployment of the Lebanese Armed Forces throughout Lebanon. The United \nStates is Lebanon\u2019s primary security partner. U.S.-provided aircraft, munitions, vehicles, \nand training have increased the capability of the Lebanese Armed Forces to fight violent \nextremism. U.S. assistance has also bolstered the Lebanon\u2019s Internal Security Forces in \nits efforts to prevent, counter, and respond to criminal and terrorist threats; to secure and \nsafeguard Lebanon\u2019s territory and people; to interdict items of proliferation concern; and \nto extend the rule of law throughout the country. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nLebanon has a free-market economy that is largely service-oriented with growth in \nthe banking and tourism sectors. The United States and Lebanon have signed a Trade \nand Investment Framework agreement to help promote an attractive investment climate, \nexpand trade relations, and removed obstacles to trade and investment between the two \ncountries. Lebanon and the United States belong to some of the same international \norganizations, including the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and World \nBank. \n \n \nLebanon hosts the highest per capita number of refugees in the world, including \nover one million from Syria, which further strained Lebanon\u2019s already weak infrastructure \nand ability to deliver social services in 2018. U.S. humanitarian assistance in Lebanon \nsupports the needs of Syrian refugees and host communities, including food, shelter, \nmedical care, clean water and sanitation, and psychosocial support. Over the past \ndecade, the United States has invested over $170 million in basic education programs \nand over $160 million in higher education programs in Lebanon for students from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds to attend top-ranking universities in Lebanon. \n \n \nIn 2017, Lebanon\u2019s most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or \nunlawful killings, including by government forces and non-state actors. There were no \nreports of government forces committing arbitrary or unlawful killings in 2018, however. \nAllegations of torture by security forces; undue and increasing restrictions on freedom of \nspeech and the press, including laws criminalizing libel and forms of political expression; \nand official corruption were issues in 2017 and 2018. Although the legal structure provides \nfor prosecution and punishment of officials for human rights abuses, enforcement \nremained a problem in 2017 and 2018, and government officials enjoyed a measure of \nimpunity for human rights abuses. \n \n \nIn September 2018, the U.S. State Department issued a Level 3 travel advisory for \nLebanon, urging U.S. citizens to reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas of Lebanon \nbecause of threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence, \nparticularly near Lebanon\u2019s borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living and working \nin Lebanon are advised that they accept the risk of remaining in the country. Although \nLebanon was a committed ally in the fight to defeat ISIS in 2017 and its ground forces \nwere one of the most effective counterterrorism partners in the region, U.S. citizens have \nbeen targeted by terrorist attacks in Lebanon in the past. The threat of anti-Western \nterrorist activity persists, as does the risk of death or injury as a bystander. Violent \nextremist groups operate in Lebanon, including the U.S. government-designated terrorist \norganizations of Hizballah, ISIS, Al-Nusrah Front, Hamas, and the Abdullah Azzam \nBrigades. Even though the Lebanese government reaffirmed its official policy of \ndisassociation in 2017, Hizballah continued its military role in Syria in support of the Syrian \nregime. Lebanon\u2019s 12 Palestinian refugee camps, including the largest Ain el-Helweh, are \noutside the jurisdiction of local security forces and pose a security threat due to potential \nmilitant recruitment and terrorist infiltration. U.S. citizens are advised to avoid travel to \nrefugee settlements. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \nKidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, is a problem \nin Lebanon. The U.S. government\u2019s ability to help U.S. citizens kidnapped or taken \nhostage is limited. U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon in spite of the travel \nadvisory are advised that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to \ntravel to assist them. U.S. citizens who also hold Lebanese citizenship are subject to the \nrequirements and responsibilities of Lebanese citizenship under Lebanese law. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \n\n \n \n10 \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is articulated in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that \nis inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and his sister #1 are currently resident citizens of Lebanon. \nApplicant\u2019s sister #2 is a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon living in Lebanon. \nThrough December 2016, Applicant maintained friendships and contact with two resident \ncitizens of Lebanon, one of whom holds dual citizenship with Mexico. A person is not \nautomatically disqualified from holding a security clearance because he has relatives or \nfriends living in a foreign country. Contacts and connections to foreign citizens are \npotentially disqualifying if they present a heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a) or create a \npotential conflict of interest under AG \u00b6 7(b). Those disqualifying conditions provide: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \n \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. The nature and strength of the family \nties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the nature of its government, \nits relationship with the United States, and its human rights record) are relevant in \n\n \n \n11 \nassessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to government coercion. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government; a family member is associated with, or dependent on, the \nforeign government; or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against \nthe United States. Moreover, in considering the nature of the foreign government, the \nadministrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the country at issue. \nSee generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). A heightened level \nof scrutiny is warranted when an applicant has a close relationship with relatives who \nreside in a country where elements hostile to the United States and its interests operate \nsomewhat freely. See generally ISCR Case No. 12-05092 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2017.) \n \nApplicant admits that he has a close relationship with his mother, who has been \nresiding in Lebanon for the past two years while his sisters are posted there by their \nrespective employers. He and his mother speak regularly by telephone. Applicant talked \nto his mother the morning of his security clearance hearing, and Applicant stayed with her \nin Lebanon as recently as August 2018. Applicant has ongoing contact with his sisters \nonly once every month or every two months, but Applicant has not persuaded me that his \nrelationships with his siblings are so casual that there is little likelihood that his sibling ties \ncould create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant resided with his mother \nand siblings before they returned to Lebanon in 2017. Furthermore, I have to consider the \nrisk of undue foreign influence through his mother, who has such close bonds with her \ndaughters that she is unwilling to leave them alone in Lebanon, despite that the elder of \nher daughters (sister #1) is married. Lebanon is a country in which terrorism and human \nrights abuses are significant. It is not a mere hypothetical concern that hostile elements \nin Lebanon could attempt to leverage Applicant\u2019s close familial ties for their own \nadvantage and purposes. AGs \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \n \n \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s friendships with the two Lebanese citizens in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d \nand 1.e, Applicant listed them on his SF 86 as foreign persons with whom he \u201chad close \nand/or continuing contact\u201d within the last seven years. However, there is little information \nabout them in the evidentiary record, including about the duration and context of the \nrelationships and contacts. Applicant denies that he has any regular or ongoing contact \nwith them and any contact whatsoever since December 2016. He denies any intention of \nmaintaining these relationships because of the possible security concerns. Any concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a) or AG \u00b6 7(b) are minimal and mitigated by AG \u00b6 8(c),\u201dcontact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is little \nlikelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n \n \nOn the death of his father in September 2012, Applicant inherited alone or with his \nmother and sisters three properties and an office in Lebanon valued at $242,000 and two \nbank accounts with deposits totaling $148,000. Before the SOR was issued, Applicant \nirrevocably waived his right to his inheritance and gave his mother a power of attorney to \ndispose of his ownership interest in those foreign assets. Those foreign assets are \nsignificant in terms of value and because they appear to be the assets that support his \nmother. AG \u00b6 7(f) provides: \n \n\n \n \n12 \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \n \n \nWhether or not Applicant\u2019s mother has acted on the power of attorney, Applicant \nhas irrevocably waived his rights to the foreign assets. These assets no longer present a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation for Applicant. AG \u00b6 8(f) applies. It provides: \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nApplicant has the burden of mitigating the risk of undue foreign influence that exists \nbecause of his immediate family\u2019s residency in and citizenship with Lebanon. AG \u00b6 8(a) \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.  \n \nApplicant understandably has close ties with his mother and sisters. While his \nmother intends to return to the United States at some future date, she plans to remain in \nLebanon for as long as one or both of her daughters are there. It is particularly likely that \nshe will remain in Lebanon until Applicant\u2019s unmarried sister #2 returns to the United \nStates. There is nothing about sister #2\u2019s employment as a civil engineer with a U.S. \ncompany in Lebanon or about sister #1\u2019s work with an international humanitarian \norganization that is likely to pose a conflict with Applicant\u2019s duties. The United States is \ncommitted to Lebanon\u2019s security, and has provided substantial financial assistance to \nLebanon since 2006 to bolster the stability of its government. Lebanon has shown itself \nto be a reliable partner in countering terrorism in the region. Yet anti-Western elements \nhave continue to operate in Lebanon, and the United States advises U.S. citizens to \nreconsider traveling to Lebanon because of crime, terrorism, kidnappings, and armed \nclashes. Applicant testified that his sister #1 is accompanied by security personnel to and \nfrom her workplace, which indicates that her employer has concerns for her safety. AG \u00b6 \n8(a) does not apply. \n \nApplicant was born in the United States but raised in Lebanon. Even so, there is \nno evidence that Applicant has any loyalty or affiliation to Lebanon or its institutions. Yet \nit is difficult to conclude that the bonds of affection and obligation to his mother and sisters \nare so minimal to satisfy the first part of AG \u00b6 8(b), which provides: \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \n\n \n \n13 \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \n \nRegarding whether Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States that he can be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of \nthe U.S. interest, he has one longstanding tie, that of United States citizenship, that is \nsignificant in assessing his vulnerability to undue foreign influence. He was raised in \nLebanon, although as a minor, he would have had little choice in that regard. He testified \nthat he planned to attend college in the United States. He chose to stay in Lebanon \nbecause of his father\u2019s terminal condition, and applied for college in Lebanon. He may \nhave registered for classes in 2012 in Lebanon, but there is no evidence that he started \ncollege in Lebanon before January 2013, which was several months after his father died. \nApplicant returned to the United States in January 2016, when he came for his graduate \nstudies. He held a Lebanese passport valid from October 2013 to October 2018, primarily \nto travel from Lebanon to Turkey. He used his Lebanese passport on a trip to Lebanon \nover the summer of 2016 because he felt it was safer than traveling on his U.S. passport. \nHe denies he holds dual citizenship with Lebanon. Even though he has had his Lebanese \npassport destroyed, and he expressed an intention to renounce his Lebanese citizenship \nif required, he presented no documentation showing any action on his part to formally \nrenounce his Lebanese citizenship or to inform Lebanon that he has destroyed his \nLebanese passport with no intention to renew it. \n \nWhereas Applicant is now only 24 years old, he has not had enough time for him \nto establish \u201clongstanding relationships\u201d as an adult in the United States. Even so, he has \ncredibly professed allegiance to the United States and to his intention to reside \npermanently in the United States. As objective evidence of his commitment in that regard, \nhe irrevocably waived his inheritance from his father\u2019s estate, which included sole \nownership of an apartment and office valued at $97,000 in Lebanon and a share of an \nadditional $293,000 in assets. Co-workers and a cousin of Applicant\u2019s deceased father, \nwho have had the opportunity to interact with Applicant on a regular basis, express no \nconcerns about Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States. A former classmate, who works \nfor the same defense contractor, has observed Applicant to pay his respects to fallen U.S. \ntroops on Memorial Day and to celebrate U.S. Independence Day. Applicant has been \nnothing but dedicated to his work with a defense contractor. His memberships in two \nprofessional organizations, his regular attendance at church services and financial \nsupport of his parish, and his activities with a sports club are relatively recent, but they \nshow he is invested in his life in the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) has some applicability, \nalthough he would have had a stronger case in mitigation had he more time to \ndemonstrate his commitment to the United States and its interests. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n\n \n \n14 \n2(d).2 Furthermore, in weighing these whole-person factors in a foreign influence case, \nthe Appeal Board has held that: \n \nEvidence of good character and personal integrity is relevant and material \nunder the whole person concept. However, a finding that an applicant \npossesses good character and integrity does not preclude the government \nfrom considering whether the applicant's facts and circumstances still pose \na security risk. Stated otherwise, the government need not prove that an \napplicant is a bad person before it can deny or revoke access to classified \ninformation. Even good people can pose a security risk because of facts \nand circumstances not under their control. See ISCR Case No. 01-26893 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002). \n \nApplicant has no control over his mother\u2019s decision to stay in Lebanon with his \nsisters or over the employment decisions that have led to his sisters being assigned to \nduties in Lebanon. Under his present circumstances, Applicant could be placed in an \nuntenable situation of having to choose between the interests of his family members and \nthose of the United States. \n \nPeople may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be \nimportant to a family member.3 In the event of any attempt at undue influence, Applicant \ntestified that he would first notify his security officials at work and request guidance. He \nhas exhibited the security consciousness required of persons with security clearance \neligibility by reporting his foreign contacts on his SF 86, by submitting his Lebanese \npassport for destruction, and by relinquishing his inheritance rights in Lebanon. \nApplicant\u2019s work colleagues and managers uniformly attest that he is careful in protecting \nhis employer\u2019s proprietary information and ensuring compliance with ITAR. He has \ndemonstrated responsibility and trustworthiness in carrying out his duties to the benefit of \nthe U.S. interests, and in his handling of his personal affairs, including his personal \nfinances. After considering all the facts and circumstances, I am persuaded that Applicant \ncan be trusted to report any attempts to influence him through his mother or sisters. \n \n \n                                                 \n2 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n3 As stated by the DOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 08-10025 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009), \u201cApplication \nof the guidelines is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely an acknowledgment that people \nmay act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices that could be important to a loved-one, such as a \nfamily member.\u201d \n\n \n \n15 \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 26-year-old single man. He works for a defense contractor as a shipping and receiving clerk. (Tr. 14) After Applicant graduated from high school, he enrolled in college. His parents agreed to help him finance the first three years of college, and he was to be solely responsible for the remainder. He attended college, but did not graduate. Working a minimum wage job, he was unable to keep up with his student loans. By March 2018, Applicant was delinquent on five student-loan accounts totaling approximately $40,000, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e.

All of them except a nominal medical \nbill are in current status. Applicant last used marijuana nearly two years ago. Preoccupied \nwith working two jobs, paying off his debt, and returning to college, he has no intention of \nresuming marijuana use in the future. I conclude he has mitigated the security concerns. \nClearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a SOR to Applicant, detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines F, financial considerations, H, drug involvement, and E, personal conduct, \nexplaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national security to grant \nsecurity clearance eligibility. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Nat. Sec. Adjudicative \n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG) effective \nwithin the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn October 23, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting all of the allegations \nand requesting a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on March 7, 2019. On \nApril 5, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing, \nscheduling Applicant\u2019s case for April 25, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. I \nreceived four Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 4) and three Applicant exhibits (AE A - AE \nC).  The transcript (Tr.) was received on May 6, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old single man. He works for a defense contractor as a \nshipping and receiving clerk. (Tr. 14) After Applicant graduated from high school, he \nenrolled in college. His parents agreed to help him finance the first three years of college, \nand he was to be solely responsible for the remainder. He attended college, but did not \ngraduate. Working a minimum wage job, he was unable to keep up with his student loans.  \n \n \nBy March 2018, Applicant was delinquent on five student-loan accounts totaling \napproximately $40,000, as alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.a through 1.e. (GE 3) \nAdditionally, he had incurred two delinquent credit card debts totaling approximately $3,500 \n(SOR subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g),  and a delinquent $50 medical bill (SOR subparagraph \n1.g). \n \n \nApplicant began his current job in November 2017. He continued working at his part-\ntime job. Working both jobs enabled him to begin resolving his delinquent debts. He \nconsolidated all of the student-loan debts in May 2018. One month later, he began making \nmonthly $138 payments. (AE A) He has been consistently making payments since then, \nand the student loan debts, as consolidated, are no longer in delinquent status.  \n \n \nAs for the credit card debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f, Applicant has made 11 \npayments totaling $900, since May 2018. (AE B)  He began resolving subparagraph 1.g, \ntotaling $472 through partial payments beginning in May 2018. (GE C) Unable to identify \nthe current creditor of the medical bill alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.h, Applicant is \nlooking into formally disputing it. (AE D) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s full-time job pays $46,000 annually. In sum, he has approximately $300 \nof monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 38) Recently, he started an auto-detailing business. \nAlthough he has yet to generate a profit, he intends to use any prospective income to help \nto continue to satisfy his debts. (Tr. 36) \n \n \nApplicant smoked marijuana with varying degrees of frequency from 2011 to 2017. \nHis use from 2011 to 2015 occurred while he was in college. He stopped using marijuana \nfor approximately nine months in November 2016 before using it once more on his birthday \nin September 2017. He has not used marijuana since then. \n \n\n3 \n \n \nApplicant now devotes his time to working and satisfying his debt. Typically, after \none job ends at 4:00 pm, he goes \u201cstraight to the next job at 5:30 [pm].\u201d (Tr. 42) Consumed \nwith working multiple jobs, he has no time to socialize with friends with whom he used \nmarijuana in the past. He has no intention of using marijuana in the future because \u201cit\u2019s not \n . . . conducive to the career that [he is] trying to have.\u201d (Tr. 17) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet  \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies trigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Since gaining a \nfull-time, salaried job, Applicant has been steadily making payments towards the \nsatisfaction of his delinquent debts. All of his debts are out of delinquent status except a \nnominal medical debt that is owed to a creditor that he cannot identify or locate. AG \u00b6 \n20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concern.   \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cthe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse \nof prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or  psychological impairment, and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 24) Applicant\u2019s history of marijuana use triggers the application of AG \u00b6 \n25(a), \u201cany substance misuse.\u201d \n \n \nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred while he was in college. He has \nnot used it in nearly two years. In that time, he has gained a salaried position, continued to \nwork at the part-time position that he held when he gained the salaried position, started a \npart-time business, and organized his finances, getting his debts out of delinquent status. \nThis evidence indicates maturity, and firmly establishes the credibility of his contention that \nhe will not abuse marijuana in the future. I conclude AG \u00b6 26(b), \u201cthe individual \nacknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance misuse, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence . . . ,\u201d \napplies. Applicant has mitigated the drug involvement security concern. \n \n \n \n\n5 \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security concern for the  \nsame reasons that he mitigated the drug involvement security concern, as discussed \nabove. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors under AG \u00b6 2(d), as set forth below:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \n \nGiven Applicant\u2019s maturity, the passage of time since he last used marijuana, and \nthe progress he has made in organizing his finances, I conclude he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns. \n \n  \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 26, 2017. \nOn October 5, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 31, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January \n\n \n2 \n \n30, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on April 23, 2019. On May 8, 2019, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for June 10, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which were admitted without \nobjection. I kept the record open until June 24, 2019, to enable him to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence. He timely submitted AX D through G, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 20, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted both allegations. His admissions \nin his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old piping designer employed by a defense contractor \nsince September 2016. His supervisor, who has known him for more than 10 years and \nsupervised him since early 2018, submitted a letter stating that he has \u201cnever observed \nany behavior that would cause concern or preclude [Applicant] from obtaining a security \nclearance.\u201d (AX A.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s work history in his SCA reflects unemployment from January to April \n2009, September to December 2014, and February to August 2016. He has lived with a \ncohabitant since October 1998. He has no children. He received a security clearance in \nAugust 2007. \n \n \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he failed to file his federal \nincome tax return for 2015 and pay the taxes due. He explained that he was \nunemployed and could not afford to pay the taxes due. (GX 1 at 39.) In response to \nDOD CAF interrogatories, he estimated that he earned about $65,000 during tax year \n2015. (GX 2 at 5.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he stated that he had contacted the IRS to \nresolve his delinquent tax debt. At the hearing, Applicant submitted evidence that he \nfiled his federal income tax returns for 2015 through 2018 and mailed them to the IRS \non June 5, 2019. They were received by the IRS on June 10, 2019. (AX G.) He testified \nthat he filed his federal returns in April 2019, but that they apparently were lost, \nrequiring that he file them again. (Tr. 26.) \n \nApplicant owes $17,299 in federal income taxes for 2015 and $8,415 for 2017. \n(AX C at 6, 9-14, 25, 31.) He owed $1,728 for 2016, and he made credit-card payments \nof $1,000 and $728 on April 17, 2019, which paid his 2016 tax debt in full. (AX C at 1-5, \n15, and 22; Tr. 12.)  \n \nApplicant owed $10,739 for 2018 federal income taxes. (AX C at 36.) He \nsubmitted evidence that he made credit-card payments of $4,739 and $3,000 on April \n\n \n3 \n \n15, 2019, for tax year 2018, leaving a federal tax debt of about $3,000 for that year. (AX \nC at 1-5.)  \n \nApplicant estimated that his credit-card payments attributable to the tax \npayments for 2018 and 2016 would be about $600 per month, and that it will take six \nyears to pay off the credit-card balances. (Tr. 35.) After the hearing, he submitted \nevidence that he established an online payment agreement with the IRS in June 2019. \nHis evidence does not reflect the amount or duration of the payments or the tax years \ncovered by the agreement. (AX F.)  \n \n \nIn April 2019, Applicant filed his state income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and \n2018. He owes $424 for 2016, $424 for 2017, and $588 for 2018. He has not yet filed \nhis state return for 2015, and he has not yet paid any of the state taxes due. (Tr. 28-30.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his periods of unemployment required that he use his \nsavings for living expenses and his medical expenses as a Type I diabetic, leaving \ninsufficient funds to pay his federal income taxes. When he found employment in 2016, \nhe \u201cmaxed out\u201d his dependents and worked overseas for two years, causing his tax \nproblems to \u201csnowball.\u201d (Tr. 17.) He has now amended his exemptions to zero. (Tr. 33.) \n \n \nApplicant received DOHA interrogatories about his taxes in September 2018. He \ntestified that he \u201cstarted trying to get the ball rolling\u201d after receiving the interrogatories, \nbut he did not begin to take action to file the past-due returns until March 2019 because \nhis job required frequent travel. (Tr. 31-32.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his cohabitant is employed, but that he usually pays for all \ntheir living expenses. (Tr. 23.) He recently leased a new car for his cohabitant, making a \ndown payment of $5,000. (Tr. 25.) In his post-hearing submission, he stated that his \ncohabitant has begun making the lease payments. (AX D.) The record does not reflect \nthe amount of his monthly lease payments. He and his cohabitant vacationed overseas \nin August 2018 at a cost of about $4,500. (Tr. 24-25.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n\n \n4 \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return \nfor 2015 (SOR 1.a) and owes about $5,000 in delinquent taxes for 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nThe SOR does not allege Applicant\u2019s failures to timely file federal income tax returns for \n\n \n5 \n \n2016 through 2018, his failures to file state tax returns for 2016 through 2018, and his \nfederal and state tax debts for 2016 through 2018. Applicant did not object to the \nevidence of unalleged conduct. To the contrary, he voluntarily presented substantial \nevidence regarding tax years 2016 through 2018, took advantage of the additional time I \ngranted for post-hearing submissions, and presented evidence of progress in resolving \nthe unalleged tax debts.  \n \n \nConduct not alleged in the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s \ncredibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person \nanalysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the \nunalleged failures to timely file federal and state income tax returns and failures to pay \nthe taxes due for these limited purposes. \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax return for 2015 and his \nfailure to pay the taxes due for that year establish the following disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. The SOR alleges only one failure to timely file his \nfederal return and one tax debt for 2015. However, Applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid tax debt \nfor 2015 reflects a continuing course of conduct and makes it \u201crecent\u201d for the purposes \nof the Guideline F mitigating conditions. ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. \n16, 2017). The tax debt for 2015 was not incurred under circumstances making \nrecurrence unlikely. To the contrary, his repeated noncompliance with filing \nrequirements and failure to timely resolve his tax debts indicates that recurrence is \nlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment in 2014 and \n2016 were conditions beyond his control and contributed to his inability to pay the taxes \ndue for 2015. However, he has not acted responsibly. Notwithstanding his significant tax \ndebt, he chose to spend substantial sums to lease a new car and take an overseas \nvacation. He did not begin to \u201cget the ball rolling\u201d until he received DOHA interrogatories \nin September 2018 and realized that his tax delinquencies were an impediment to \nobtaining a security clearance. A person who begins to address security concerns only \nafter having been placed on notice that his or her application for a security clearance is \nin jeopardy may lack the willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her \npersonal interests are not at stake. ADP Case No. 15-03696 (App. Bd. Apr. 5, 2019). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not fully established. Applicant obtained professional tax advice \nand assistance in March 2019. Although he has made progress in resolving his tax \nproblems, his tax debt for 2015 is not resolved, and his other tax problems are not yet \nunder control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Although Applicant submitted evidence that \nhe has a current payment agreement with the IRS, he provided no evidence that it \napplies to the 2015 tax debt and no evidence of payments under the agreement. He \nreceives some mitigating credit for resolving the 2016 federal tax debt and making \nsubstantial payments on his 2018 federal tax debt. However, his resolution of the 2016 \ndebt and partial resolution of the 2018 debt did not substantially improve his overall \nfinancial situation, because he resolved the tax debt by incurring credit-card debt.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is partially established. Applicant filed his 2015 federal income tax \nreturn in June 2018, but he has made no payments on the debt, and he presented no \nevidence that his current payment agreement applies to the 2015 debt or that he has \nmade any payments under the agreement. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s eventual filing of \nthe 2015 federal income tax return does not end the inquiry. A security clearance \nadjudication is not a tax-enforcement procedure. It is an evaluation of an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. The fact that Applicant has filed his 2015 \nreturn does not preclude careful consideration of his security worthiness based on his \nentire record of repeatedly failing to comply with filing and payments requirements. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \n\n \n8 \n \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his failure to timely file his 2015 federal income tax return \nand pay the taxes due. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant graduated from high school and attended three years of college classes from 2003 to May 2007, but she has not yet obtained a degree. Applicant completed her security clearance application on August 8, 2016. She has held a security clearance since 2007. (GE 1) She has worked for her current employer for two years.

Nussbaum, Esq. \n \n \n10/07/2019 \nDecision \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \nThis case alleges security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 9, 2018, in accordance with the Department of Defense (DoD) \nDirective 5220.6, as amended (Directive), the DoD issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline F. The SOR  \ninformed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD \nadjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 26, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer) The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on April \n4, 2019, scheduling the hearing for May 17, 2019. The hearing was postponed for good \ncause (documented medical issues) and was convened on September 5, 2019. The \nGovernment offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted, with the exception \nof GE 6, which the Government withdrew after objection by Applicant\u2019s counsel. (Tr. 12) \nApplicant testified on her own behalf. Applicant submitted Exhibits, which were marked \n\n \n2 \n \nas Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-W, and accepted into the record without objection. The record \nwas held open until September 30, 2019 and Applicant submitted documentation which \nwas marked as AE X, and accepted into the record without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 13, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 45, is single and has two adult children and one five-year-old child. \nShe has no military service. Applicant graduated from high school and attended three \nyears of college classes from 2003 to May 2007, but she has not yet obtained a degree. \nApplicant completed her security clearance application on August 8, 2016. She has held \na security clearance since 2007. (GE 1)  She has worked for her current employer for two \nyears. (Tr. 26) Although Applicant has worked in the contracting field since about 2005, \nshe has had various periods of unemployment during that time. (GE 1) Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment occurred in late 2000, 2010, 2011, 2012 and part of 2014. (GE 1, Tr. 17) \nShe has experienced severe medical issues and surgery since 2007. (Tr. 32) She has \nhad several hospitalizations. \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in February 2012, \nwhich was discharged in May 2012; has two student loans in collection; seven medical \naccounts in collection; a charged-off auto loan; and several consumer collection accounts \nfor a total of $67,521. (GE 2, 3, and 4) Applicant acknowledged the Chapter 7 bankruptcy \n(SOR \u00b61.a) in the amount of $69,000 and disclosed the information on her security \nclearance application concerning her delinquent debts. She believes that filing for Chapter \n7 bankruptcy is a legitimate means of resolving debts. When she was working, she tried \nto make some payments on her outstanding debts, but she could not maintain the \npayments. Before filing for bankruptcy, she had been unemployed for one year and her \nmonthly income (from unemployment and food stamps) was $1,646. (GE 5) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she has experienced financial hardship since 2003. \nShe prepared a statement for the DOD concerning her debts. In that 2003 statement, she \nnoted that with regards to the majority of them, she had made some payments and \npayment arrangements. She had medical/hospital debts even at that time. She admitted \nthat she was not very responsible with credit cards and let her mother use them as well. \nApplicant sought help from an accredited counseling/debt consolidation company and \npaid them about $400. The company did not settle any accounts and wanted more money \nfor another year of help. She decided that was not the route for her. (GE 6) She was \ncandid about her finances due to lack of career stability, and her lack of experience \nconcerning financial issues. She provided for her children and basic needs but had no \nmoney to pay other bills. She explained that she was a single mother for 13 years but has \nnot received any court-ordered child support since 1996. She stated that she had been \n\u201cbad\u201d with managing money, but her hospitalization in 1997 created a sizeable debt. She \nreferred to her new employment and wanted to pay every bill and avoid future credit \nmistakes. Her net monthly salary at that time was $2,392, with no monthly remainder. \n(GE 6) \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2010 credit bureau report (GE 4) reflects the Sallie Mae student loans \nwere current and \u201cpaid as agreed\u201d or in a deferred status. The other accounts that were \ndelinquent were included in her 2012 bankruptcy. (GE 5) \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that she owed the alleged debts \nexcept for one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l) and provided explanations for each allegation. Applicant \nhad agreed to payment arrangements or settlements with all creditors. She attached her \nbank statement that showed the individual monthly amounts that would be taken from her \nbank account. Applicant provided receipts from some payments made in 2018. In \naddition, she noted a duplicate account in SOR \u00b61.m and \u00b61.n, which amounted to $262. \nTwo student loans (which were duplicates) in SOR \u00b61.o and \u00b6 1.p for $17,189 and \n$20,433 were merged into one account and later settled. She also noted two non-SOR \naccounts that were delinquent and now resolved.  \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that her current employer understands her \nmedical issues and is supportive of her need for time off due to the continuing medical \nissues. (Tr. 18) The employer allows her to telework.  (Tr. 31) Applicant has adjusted her \nspending habits. She now has only one child remaining in the home. She is now living \nwith her aunt so that she does not have a mortgage or rent. She had previously lived with \nher mother. Her current employer has a tuition reimbursement program and Applicant \nhopes to avail herself of that program. (Tr. 26) Before this employment, Applicant earned \nabout $55,000. (Tr. 29) She admits that her unemployment periods were due to missing \nmany days from work due to her various illnesses. She did not tell her previous employers \nwhy she was taking so many days off and she would be let go. (Tr. 30) \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.b., Applicant admitted the allegation for the car loan in the amount \nof $15,417 and included with her answer a copy of the November 2018 settlement \narrangement agreement.  The account was to be settled in the amount of $2,603.05, with \na monthly payment of $100. From the bank statement, it appears a $100 payment was \nmade in November 2018. However, at the hearing Applicant submitted a new settlement \nagreement with an amount of $1,993. She also provided a debit from her bank account \nin that amount. (AE B) This account is settled and resolved. (Tr. 34) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c, is a collection account for a cable bill in the amount of $2,099, as a \nresult of equipment returned but not credited to Applicant. In her answer to the SOR, \nApplicant agreed to pay $105.95 a month. At the hearing, she submitted a settled account \nsummary and included a debit from her account for $1,299.50. The letter confirms that \nthe account is settled in full. (AE C)  \n \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.d, a charged-off-account in the amount of $983, Applicant included \nwith her answer to the SOR a payment arrangement of $25 a month with her bank debit \nstatement. At the hearing, Applicant presented a letter stating that the settlement \narrangement was complete and the account balance was zero. (AE D) \n \nAs to the medical accounts: SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.h,1.j, 1.k, 1.m, 1.n (duplicate), 1.q, \n1.r,  and 1.s, for a total of approximately $4,300, Applicant  presented documentation that \n\n \n4 \n \nthe medical bills have been paid or settled in full. She has resolved the medical debts. \nSOR \u00b61.e is a duplicate of 1.d. (AE E, G, H, J, L, N, P, R,) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b6 1.f is a collection account for $298 (rental car) Applicant provided \nproof of several $25 payments with her answer to the SOR. She submitted documentation \nat the hearing that the account is paid in full. (AE F) \n \nAs to SOR 1.i, an insurance collection account in the amount of $142, Applicant \nmade several $25 monthly payments in 2018 and submitted a 2019 letter stating the \naccount is satisfied. (AE I) \n \nSOR allegation \u00b61.l, a phone collection account in the amount of $1,192, was \ndenied. Applicant stated in her answer that it was not on her credit report. At the hearing, \nshe provided documentation that the account has been resolved. (AE K) \n \nThe two student loan debts in SOR 1.o and 1.p are duplicates. Applicant explained \nthe two private student loans were merged. At the hearing, she presented documentation \nthat they were settled for an amount of $2,500. (AE M) Applicant originally had them in \nher bankruptcy, but student loans cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. \n \nSOR allegation 1.t in the amount of $5,343 is a collection account for furniture. \nApplicant settled the account for $1,500. (AE Q) \n \nApplicant acknowledged that she was able to resolve all the SOR accounts in the \nlast few months due to collecting income from loans that she had made to various family \nand friends. She did not take out a personal loan. (Tr.44) Applicant had been asking for \nseveral months for the funds that she had loaned to various people. (Tr. 86) She believes \nshe received about $10,000 as a result of her demand that people repay her. (Tr. 67) \n \nApplicant received financial counseling and gained skill in saving and budgeting. \n(AE U) She has a good job and higher income. The employer understands her medical \ncondition and Applicant will be able to take medical leave.  \n \nApplicant paid two non-SOR debts and presented documentation that she has \nresolved them. (AE V) Applicant acknowledged that she has made some mistakes.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is $86,000. She submitted a financial statement. \n(AE A) Applicant has a net monthly remainder of about $843. Applicant has no current \ndelinquent debts. She works with a budget and has made several changes to her life style \nto cut expenses.   \n \nAs post hearing submissions, Applicant submitted information concerning Federal \nstudent loans that were not alleged in the SOR. The loans were in forbearance and she \nhas an agreement to make three payments of $276 a month for three months, which she \nhas completed. (AE X) After the completion of the payments, they will be submitted into \na Revised Pay As You Go Pay Plan with payments of $227 a month. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nCharacter References \n \nApplicant submitted 13 character references and recognitions that she has \nreceived during her career. (AE S) Each character letter attests to her good judgment and \nprofessionalism. Applicant performs at a high standard and has always followed protocol. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO  10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n6 \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems, including her 2012 bankruptcy, establish \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).  \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n\n \n7 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are the result of circumstances beyond her control and medical \nissues. All of the above financial considerations mitigating conditions are raised, in part, \nby the facts in this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were due to chronic illness, \nunemployment, lack of child support, underemployment, and being the sole provider for \nher family. Applicant\u2019s financial problems occurred under circumstances unlikely to recur. \nThey do not cast doubt on her judgment or reliability. She could have been more \naggressive in her dealings with creditors but she could not pay all the bills. She did not \nlive beyond her means. She moved in with relatives. Several accounts were duplicates. \nHer efforts were somewhat lacking. Notwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s resolution of her past \nfinancial problems and her present financial posture show diligence and responsibility in \nthe handling of her financial obligations. She is following a solid source of financial \ncounseling and she has a budget. She is now paying on federal student loans, which \nwere not alleged on the SOR. On the whole, Applicant\u2019s finances are under control. She \ncredibly promises to maintain her financial responsibility. She has always tried to obtain \nmore education to better her employment opportunities. Her earnings should be sufficient \nto pay for her living expenses and current debts. I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.t. for \nApplicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F  and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, including Applicant\u2019s credibility and openness at the hearing, and her \n\n \n8 \n \nmany years of  work service, I conclude that Applicant presented sufficient information to \nmitigate the security concerns raised by her financial indebtedness. Accordingly, \nApplicant has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.t:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on March 10, 2017. \nOn October 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. This action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR with a detailed 13-page answer, denying all \nof the alleged delinquencies. He attached several documents to his answer. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 25, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for February 27, 2019. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled.  \n03/29/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. At the hearing, Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough K, which were admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was received at \nDOHA on March 13, 2019.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 52 years old. He was married from 1990 to 2017. (Tr. 44) His wife is \ndeceased.

(Tr. 52) \nIn 2012, Applicant was struggling to make mortgage payments because his overtime \nopportunities decreased. He obtained a home-equity line of credit (HELOC) of $98,700 \nto use for mortgage payments on house # 3. (Tr. 21, 53) He knew it was depreciating \nbut hoped that the market would recover. (Tr. 54) He tried to sell it but received no \noffers. Eventually, he gave up and both the primary and second loan were defaulted.  \nHe allowed it to go to a foreclosure-auction sale in February 2014. (Tr. 56) Applicant \nhad the two Bank of America (BOA) mortgage loans on the property totaling $300,000. \n(Tr. 57) A loan-servicing company bought house # 3 for $120,000 at the auction.  \n \nApplicant testified that shortly after the foreclosure sale he received a packet in \nthe mail from an unknown loan-servicing or collection agent at SOR \u00b6 1.d (D.O.) \ndemanding that he pay approximately $230,000, which presumably was for the balance \nhe owed after foreclosure on the two mortgage loans. (Tr. 57, 67) Applicant assumed \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s March 10, 2017, \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) (GE 1). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nthe amount was incorrect and he discarded this mail in 2014. (Tr. 67, 70) He was \nconfused and thought that \u201ccharged-off\u201d on his credit report meant forgiven. He also \nthought that aged-off his credit report accounts were closed. (Tr. 58, 76) He did not \ncontact D.O. or the BOA or anybody else from 2014 until late 2018 to try to resolve this \ndeficiency that he knew he owed. (Tr. 68) He admitted that he should have been more \nproactive. (Tr. 70)  \n \n After his clearance interview in June 2018, Applicant began to put the pieces \ntogether and realized that D.O. was a collection agent for BOA or its successor \ncreditors. Still he took no action. (Tr. 62) After receipt of the SOR in October 2018, he \ncontacted D.O. and settled the primary mortgage for $33,000 on February 27, 2019. (Tr. \n58) He provided a copy of the compromise and settlement agreement reflecting that the \noriginal mortgage loan debt of $263,992 was settled for $33,000. (AE B) He has not \nreceived an IRS Form 1099 for this income (resulting from forgiven debt) yet. (Tr. 76-77)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was a charged-off debt in the amount of $83,101 for the second \nmortgage loan on house # 3. Applicant testified that he only recently started \ncommunicating with BOA representatives in an effort to resolve this long-standing debt. \n(Tr. 75) He provided a packet of correspondences with BOA and its various collection \nagents showing his efforts to resolve this matter. (AE A, AE D) (Tr. 33-35) It remains \nunresolved.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a charged-off credit-card account in the amount of $2,716. \nApplicant testified that he paid this debt in full on March 13, 2017. (Tr. 20) He explained \nthat this was a credit-card debt run up by his late wife without his knowledge. He \nprovided documentary evidence attached to his answer to the SOR reflecting that the \naccount now has a zero balance and it is paid in full.    \n  \nApplicant attached several documents to his November 2018 answer to the SOR \nincluding; a copy of a certificate showing that he completed a few hours of financial \ncounseling on November 8, 2018; pay stubs reflecting his gross pay of $5,413 every \ntwo weeks; a personal financial statement reflecting a current mortgage of $153,000 on \nhis primary home; a stocks and bonds investment portfolio and 401(k) account \nstatement reflecting that Applicant has assets valued at well over $2 million, plus other \nbank account and IRA statements showing his substantial net worth.   \n \n \n \n                                        Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching \nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable here:  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his testimony, \ncredit reports, and documents submitted at the hearing. The Government produced \nsubstantial evidence to support the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c), \nthereby shifting the burden to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts.2  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;   \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors and otherwise resolved debts. \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nApplicant endured the death of his wife in 2017, and a real-estate market \ncollapse in 2008. These conditions were beyond his control. However, he did not act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He engaged in a real estate investment plan, \nwhich did not work out. He speculated by obtaining a HELOC on a property that was \nalready depreciating and in distress. When he could not sell the property, he made a \ndecision to walk away and allow it to go to foreclosure sale. Documents he produced, \nshow that Applicant is a sophisticated investor. He testified that he thought charged-off \nmeant forgiven, and that if delinquent debts aged off his credit reports, they were \nclosed. I do not find that testimony to be credible. He had substantial assets available to \npay his delinquent debts well before the evening of his hearing. He willfully engaged in a \nstrategic default on house # 3, and then deliberately ignored creditors and collection \nagents for the period between 2014 and 2018, while amassing a prodigious investment \nportfolio. He has not produced relevant and responsive documentation showing good-\nfaith efforts before the compromise and settlement in late February 2019. He still has \nnot satisfied the second loan at SOR \u00b6 1.b.   \n \n \nApplicant appropriately obtained credit counseling to address his financial \nproblems in November 2018 after receipt of the SOR. He produced documentation \nshowing payment in full on SOR \u00b6 1.c, and an eleventh-hour compromise and \nsettlement of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d in February 2019. He was prompted into action by the \nsecurity clearance process. He did not previously engage in a good-faith effort to \nresolve debts. His efforts were too little, too late. He has not met his burden to show that \nhis financial problems are under control, and that his debts were incurred under \ncircumstances making them unlikely to recur. The mitigating conditions enumerated \nabove in AG \u00b6 20 do not apply.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG, Appendix A, \n\u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances remain a security concern. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n          AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d:            For Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:                                   Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                 Robert J.

Smith, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/07/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMURPHY, Braden M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose largely during his second marriage, after his wife lost her \njob and they fell behind on household expenses and other debts. Applicant\u2019s debts are \nnow largely resolved and are under control. Applicant provided sufficient evidence to \nmitigate financial security concerns. Applicant\u2019s eligibility for continued access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 21, 2015. \nOn October 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudication Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, due to his delinquent debts. The DOD CAF \nissued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \n \n \namended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 15, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nThe case was assigned to me on January 9, 2019. On January 31, 2019, DOHA issued \na notice of hearing scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for February 19, 2019.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough E. All exhibits were admitted without objection. Applicant and one other witness \ntestified. I held the record open to allow Applicant the opportunity to submit additional \ndocumentation. Applicant subsequently submitted several documents,1 which were \nmarked as AE F through AE N and admitted without objection.2 DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing on March 4, 2019. The record initially closed on April 8, 2019. \nOn April 16, 2019, Applicant sent an e-mail detailing his continued efforts to resolve one \nof the SOR debts. I admitted his e-mail as AE O and closed the record.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, with an explanation. I \nincorporate his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old. He was married from 1999 to 2005. He and his first wife \nhad two children, a son (age 17) and a daughter (age 18). (Tr. 47-48, 52-54) Applicant \nremarried in 2009. They divorced in late 2017. His second wife has two children, by a \nprior relationship. (Tr. 33, 35) \n \nApplicant served honorably in the United States Navy from 1993 to 2001. Since \nthen, he has worked for his current employer, a large defense contractor. He works as a \nsecurity analyst and facility security officer and has a $93,000 annual salary. He has held \na clearance for about 25 years. (Tr. 10-11, 32-33, 35, 47-48, 54) \n \n \nThe debts alleged in the SOR are a foreclosed mortgage, two charged-off student \nloans, two past-due medical debts, and a cable bill. Applicant listed several of them on \nhis SCA. They are detailed on credit reports in the record. (GE 4, GE 5, GE 6). He \ndiscussed his debts in background interviews in December 2016 and November 2017. \n(GE 2, GE 3) \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s first post-hearing document was a complete copy of the property settlement from his divorce, \nan excerpt of which was admitted at hearing as AE A. I incorporated the full document in AE A.  \n \n2 AE F is Applicant\u2019s 2018 performance appraisal. AE G through AE L are labelled as Applicant described \nthem in his March 4, 2019 e-mail. AE M and AE N relate to Applicant\u2019s student loan debts.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant explained that the delinquent debts were due to his wife\u2019s job loss and \nher student loans, and his own four-year decline in income due to increases in taxes. (GE \n1; Tr. 61-63) Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2009, when his wife lost her job at a \nlarge retailer. He also asserted that they fell behind due to his wife\u2019s overspending. (Tr. \n35-39)  \n \nApplicant pursued financial counseling through his employer\u2019s Employee \nAssistance Program (EAP). He said he was told to come up with a reasonable budget \nand to stick to it. Applicant was not able to do that. (Tr. 38-39, 57, 60)  \n \nIn 2008, before he remarried, Applicant purchased a home. His mother co-signed \nthe loan. Applicant and his wife became jointly responsible for the $1,800 monthly \nmortgage payments when they married, in 2009. They fell behind in about April 2015. He \nwas making about $80,000 annually at the time. (Tr. 35-37) They attempted to modify \ntheir home loan, but were unsuccessful, and the home was foreclosed in December 2016. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) (Tr. 39-43, 58, 69-70) \n \nAE D is an IRS Form 1099-A for the property for the 2016 tax year. AE D lists the \nmortgage owed as about $190,000, and the fair market value of the property as about \n$155,000, leaving a deficiency balance of about $35,000. The property agreement shows \nApplicant is responsible for the deficiency balance. (AE A at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 21).3  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother was issued an IRS Form 1099-A for the property for the 2016 \ntax year confirming the amounts. (AE D) AE D lists Applicant\u2019s mother as the debtor, \nthough AE D was mailed to Applicant at his address in State 1. He testified that a Form \n1099-A was also mailed to him, but was erroneously mailed to his mother\u2019s address, in \nanother state. He said the document has been lost, in part because his mother is elderly, \nfrail, and has cognitive difficulties. (Tr. 28-30, 70-72) At the time of the hearing, the home \nhad yet to be sold at auction by the bank, so the total amount Applicant owes on the \ndeficiency balance, if anything, is unclear. (Tr. 71-74) \n \nIn January 2019, Applicant attempted to procure a private loan to pay his debts, \nbut was denied because he did not have sufficient good credit. (AE B; Tr. 34-35) He then \nenrolled in a credit repair service to clean up potentially inaccurate or invalid accounts in \nhis credit record. (Tr. 27, 47; AE C) It was pointed out to him at hearing, however, that \nthis would do little good, since he had admitted most of the debts in the SOR, thereby \nvalidating them. (Tr. 63-69) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($13,215) and \u00b6 1.c ($8,913) are two charged-off student loans, both in \nhis wife\u2019s name, though he was a co-signer. His wife stopped making payments on them \nin about 2014. The property settlement agreement shows that he is responsible for them. \n                                                          \n3 Applicant also noted that, on the advice of his divorce counsel, he assumed the payments for his former \nwife\u2019s car to keep it from being repossessed. (Tr. 79-80) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n(AE A at \u00b6 21; Tr. 43-46, 60, 80). The debts have both been settled and paid. (AE H, AE \nI; AE K, AE M, AE N) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($144) is a past-due medical debt. It has now been paid. (AE J, AE K) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($278) is a past-due cable debt. It has now been paid. (AE G) SOR \u00b6 1.f ($115) \nis a past-due medical debt. Applicant attempted to pay it but was unsuccessful. (AE O) \n \n \nApplicant now lives with his girlfriend. She owns the home but he contributes to \nthe household expenses. He pays $500 a month in child support for his minor child from \nhis first marriage, and is current. Tr. 48-49) He pays $45 a month to the credit repair \ncompany, but can terminate the agreement at any time. (Tr. 88-90). His finances have \nstabilized since his divorce. (Tr. 77-78) \n \n \nAs an FSO, Applicant is professionally aware that financial problems and \ndelinquent debt can give rise to a security concern. (Tr. 51) As the FSO for a large defense \ncontractor, Applicant dictates security protocol for the company\u2019s several thousand \nemployees and visitors. He ensures compliance with the National Industrial Security \nProgram Operating Manual (NISPOM), including matters of personnel security. (Tr. 56-\n57 74-77) \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded at work. In December 2017, his company was given \na \u201csuperior\u201d security rating by the Defense Security Service in a security assessment in \nwhich, as the FSO, Applicant played a key role. (AE E; Tr. 32-33) He has earned excellent \nperformance ratings. (AE F)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified. The witness is responsible for security compliance, \nand is several levels above Applicant in seniority. Applicant has worked with or for the \nwitness for several years, in various capacities. The witness regards Applicant as loyal, \ntrustworthy, and someone who properly protects classified information. Tr. 82-88) \n \nPolicies \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.4 As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d5 \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n                                                          \n4 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 \nto a security clearance\u201d).  \n \n5 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation.6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could rise security concerns. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting \n                                                          \n6 ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfinancial obligations\u201d are applicable, given the record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nSOR debt \u00b6 1.a is the foreclosed mortgage from Applicant\u2019s former marital home, \nabout $190,000. As noted in the property settlement document, AE A, he is responsible \nfor the deficiency balance, estimated at about $35,000. The debt remains unresolved, \nsince the property remained unsold at the time of the hearing. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts occurred due to several circumstances. His wife lost her job, the \nfamily income was affected by tax increases, and his wife fell behind on her student loan \npayments. Applicant also asserted that his wife\u2019s overspending contributed to their \nfinancial woes. Applicant was not able to keep up with the mortgage and other monthly \nexpenses on a single income, though he remained employed. Applicant\u2019s debts resulted \nlargely from circumstances beyond his control. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.  \n \n \nWhen Applicant and his wife fell behind on their mortgage, in April 2015, he \npursued financial counseling through his employer\u2019s EAP program. He was told to make \na budget and to stick to it, which proved difficult. Applicant briefly hired a credit repair firm \nto resolve accounts on his credit report that he was not responsible for, but this was not \neffective since he acknowledged responsibility for all the debts in the SOR. Applicant gets \nsome credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) for his pre-hearing efforts to resolve his debts, \neven though they were largely not very effective.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nBut for the deficiency balance, Applicant\u2019s debts are largely resolved. His former \nwife\u2019s student loan debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), for which he assumed responsibility, have \nnow been settled and paid. The debts at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f have been paid. Applicant \nattempted to resolve the small debt at SOR \u00b6 1.e, but could not locate the creditor. \nApplicant and his wife divorced in late 2017. All of his debts are attributable to that \ntimeframe, and his finances have since improved. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my \nwhole-person analysis.  \n \nI had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the hearing, and to \nassess his credibility. I found him a credible witness. I also credit his lengthy career in \npersonnel security as an FSO for his company and in other positions. Applicant also \nrecognized he was in financial difficulty and sought advice on how to rectify it. The origins \nof his debts are limited to the timeframe of his second marriage, and he has now begun \nto stabilize his finances. Though he did so at a later stage, perhaps, than he should have, \nI believe he will use the hearing as a learning experience to avoid similar financial issues \nin the future. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s continued eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on January 19, 2018. \nOn October 29, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 19, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On January 3, 2019, Department Counsel amended the \n\n \n2 \n \nSOR by adding one additional allegation under Guideline F. Department Counsel was \nready to proceed on January 10, 2019, and the case was assigned to me on February \n26, 2019. On March 4, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for March 28, 2019. On March 12, \n2019, the hearing date was changed to March 27, 2019. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nany documentary evidence. I kept the record open until April 19, 2019, to enable him to \nsubmit documentary evidence. He timely submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through \nI, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 11, \n2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.k \nand 1.n. He admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a with an explanation. He denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o. His admissions in his answer and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a financial analyst employed by a defense contractor since June \n2018. (Tr. 29.) He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 1990 to April 1994 \nand was honorably discharged. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy Reserve (USNR) in 1996. \nHe worked for a utility company from December 1999 until he was called to active duty \nin the USNR in February 2009. He remained on active duty in various locations until \nJune 2015. In August 2015, he retired from the USNR as a petty officer first class (pay \ngrade E-6).  \n \nApplicant worked for a short time as a deputy sheriff after he was released from \nactive duty. He worked for a defense contractor from December 2015 to October 2016. \nHe was a civilian employee of the U.S. Navy from October 2016 until he was terminated \nin September 2017. He was then employed by a defense contractor from February to \nJune 2018, when he began his current job. He received a security clearance at the \nbeginning of his active duty in 1990.   \n \n \nApplicant married in August 2005, separated in January 2016, and is now \ndivorced. No children were born during the marriage. While married, he had four \nstepchildren, ages 28, 27, 21, and 20. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition, and 12 delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from January 2018 (GX 3) \nand September 2018 (GX 2.) The evidence reflecting the bankruptcies and delinquent \ndebts is summarized below. \n \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b: Bankruptcies. Applicant and his wife filed a joint Chapter \n13 bankruptcy petition in February 2014, and it was dismissed in October 2014 for \nfailure to make payments. They intentionally stopped making payments when they \ndecided that a Chapter 7 bankruptcy better suited their financial needs. They filed a joint \nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition in November 2014, and they received a discharge in \nMarch 2015. Their petition listed assets of $96,862 and liabilities of $419,060. The debts \nincluded first and second mortgages on a home, multiple vehicle repossessions, \nmedical and dental bills, debts related to care and maintenance of horses and other \nanimals, utility bills, and various consumer debts.  \n \nApplicant attributed the bankruptcies to delinquent debts his wife brought into the \nmarriage and her surreptitious and excessive spending after they were married. (Tr. 36,) \nThe Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition reflects student loans incurred by his ex-wife from \n2003-2007 totaling $57,413. All other debts attributed to his ex-wife (a student loan for \n$17,766; an overpayment by the Department of Veterans Affairs; and multiple credit-\ncard accounts and collection accounts) were incurred after their marriage. (GX 5.) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.j: Eight delinquent student loans totaling about $28,565. The \nSeptember 2018 credit report reflects that Applicant has disputed these debts. (GX 2.) \nThe record does not reflect the basis for the disputes. Applicant testified that he began \nincurring student loans in 1998 or 1999 and that his last student loan was incurred in \n2005. (Tr. 48.) He earned an associate\u2019s degree in June 2010 and took some additional \ncourses after receiving his degree. Payments on the loans were deferred until about \n2012. (Tr. 50.) He did not contact the lenders or collection agencies until he began \ngathering information for his Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in 2015. (Tr. 51.) He \ncontacted the collection agencies again after he received his Chapter 7 discharge. In \nAugust 2018, he entered into a rehabilitation program providing for ten consecutive \nmonthly $36 payments. He had made four payments by automatic debit as of the date \nof the hearing. (AX D; Tr. 52-55.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: Car loan charged off for $147. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant \nstated that this was a car loan he co-signed for his ex-wife. The creditor for this debt is \nthe same as the creditor alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. This debt was for a vehicle that was \nreturned to the dealer as a \u201clemon.\u201d (GX 1 at 43.) It appears to have been included in \nthe judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: Government debt of $91 referred for collection. In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated that this debt was for his wife\u2019s uniforms when she was \nemployed at a military hospital. (Tr. 58.) He has taken no action to dispute it or \notherwise resolve it. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: Government debt for $85. This debt is listed in the credit report \nfrom January 2018 as a \u201cgovernment miscellaneous debt.\u201d (GX 3 at 6.) Applicant \ntestified that he contacted the collection agency listed in the credit report and was \ninformed that this debt was incurred by his ex-wife when she was employed at a military \nhospital. (Tr. 59.) He has taken no action to dispute or otherwise resolve it. \n\n \n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: Medical bill referred for collection of $118. The January 2018 \ncredit report reflects that this debt was \u201copen\u201d as of November 2014 and was included in \na bankruptcy petition. (GX 3 at 10.) Applicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition did not \nspecifically list this debt, but it would have been discharged in March 2015. Absent \nfraud, in a no-asset bankruptcy, all unsecured, nonpriority debts are discharged when \nthe bankruptcy court grants a discharge, even if they are not listed on a bankruptcy \nschedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 F.3d 110, 114 (3d Cir. 1996); Francis v. Nat\u2019l Revenue \nService, Inc., 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. S.D. FL 2010). The debt is not reflected in the \nSeptember 2018 credit report. (GX 2.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: Judgment for $18,998 for a delinquent car loan. This judgment \nwas entered against Applicant and his wife in January 2016. (GX 4.) In his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated that this debt was for his wife\u2019s vehicle but that he co-signed \nthe loan. Their separation agreement makes no provision for disposition of motor \nvehicles or assignment of responsibility for joint debts. (AX E.) The court records reflect \nthat a default judgment was entered, but Applicant testified that he appeared in court \nbut his wife did not. He also testified that, after his court appearance, he discussed the \ndebt with the creditor\u2019s representative and was informed that he would be contacted \nafter the vehicle was sold, but that he had no further communication with the creditor. \n(Tr. 63.) He did not contact the creditor again until he received the amended SOR. (Tr. \n95.) In a post-hearing submission, Applicant stated he contacted the creditor and \nlearned that the car was auctioned for $9,800. The creditor is willing to make a payment \nagreement, but Applicant will not be able to afford any payments until mid-June 2019. \n(AX A.) The debt is not resolved. \n \nApplicant\u2019s net pay is about $3,150 per month. He receives $1,384 per month for \na service-connected disability. He has a pension account from a previous employer that \ntotals about $21,000, but he will not use it to pay his delinquent bills because of the \nadverse consequences of an early withdrawal. (Tr. 64-65.) \n \nApplicant did not file his federal income tax returns for 2015, 2016, and 2017 on \ntime. He testified that his ex-wife was uncooperative in providing the documentation for \nthe years they were married, and he finally decided to file separately. (Tr. 66-68.), The \nIRS filed a substitute tax return for him in January 2018, and he filed his 2015 return in \nAugust 2018. (AX I.) He filed his 2016 return in November 2018 and his 2017 return in \nJune 2018. (AX G; AX H.) He filed his 2018 return on time, and he does not owe any \nfederal income taxes. He owed about $330 for tax year 2015, but it was satisfied by \napplication of refunds for subsequent tax years. (AX F.) \n \nApplicant admitted that he answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question in his SCA asking \nwhether he had failed to file returns or pay federal, state, or other taxes. He attributed \nhis answer to a mistake and admitted that he should have answered \u201cYes.\u201d He \nanswered \u201cYes\u201d to a question whether he was currently delinquent on any debt, \nbecause he knew he owed taxes of about $330 for 2015. (Tr. 70-71.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nWhen Applicant was hired as a civilian employee of the Navy in October 2016, \nhe was a probationary employee. In August 2017, he was terminated for unsatisfactory \nperformance and disorderly and unprofessional conduct on two occasions. The \ntermination notice recites that he leapt from his chair during a meeting, shouted at his \nsupervisor, and pointed his finger in her face. (GX 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified \nthat his supervisor berated him at length in the presence of co-workers, cursed at him, \nand used the \u201cf\u201d word. At that point, he stood up, told her that he \u201chad enough of her \nlanguage,\u201d and walked out of her office. (Tr. 23.)  \n \nApplicant has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity \nCommission (EEOC). His complaint is pending decision by an EEOC administrative \njudge. In the complaint, Applicant contends that he was the victim of trumped-up \ncharges in retaliation for accusing his supervisor of subjecting him to discrimination, \nharassment, and a hostile work environment based on his race (Caucasian), age (47) \nand sex (male). His supervisor was a 49-year-old African-American female. He accused \nhis supervisor of using abusive and foul language, i.e., repeated use of the \u201cf\u201d word, \nberating him in the presence of co-workers, falsely accusing him of mishandling a \ntravel-document situation that occurred on a ship that was not under his authority, \nfalsely accusing him of recording his sick leave incorrectly, refusing to approve leave, \nand harassing him about taking leave. (AX C.) The record reflects that his supervisor \nwas reprimanded in July 2014 for similar conduct. (AX C, Enclosure 2.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n\n \n6 \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n\n \n7 \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k appears to have been included in the judgment \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the \nsame guideline, one of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant=s \nfavor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged \ntwice). Accordingly, I have resolved SOR \u00b6 1.k in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nremaining allegations under this guideline and are sufficient to raise the following \ndisqualifying conditions:2  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n                                                          \n2 The disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d) may not \nbe an independent basis for revoking Applicant\u2019s security clearance, because it was not alleged in the \nSOR. However, it may be considered to assess Applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a particular \nadjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; to consider whether Applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a \nwhole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered his \nfailure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns and his federal tax debt for these limited \npurposes. \n\n \n8 \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s marital breakup and his ex-wife\u2019s \nexcessive spending were conditions largely beyond his control. The bankruptcies were \nthe product of financial mismanagement and preceded his marital breakup and his \ndisputed termination of employment. His loss of employment in September 2017 may \nhave been a condition beyond his control, but the basis for his termination is disputed \nand has not yet been resolved by the EEOC. In any event, he has not acted \nresponsibly. He received a fresh financial start with his Chapter 7 discharge, but he did \nnot initiate the rehabilitation plan for his student loans until August 2018. He has taken \nno action to dispute or otherwise resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m. He \ncontacted the creditor for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.o shortly after the judgment \nagainst him was filed in January 2016, but he took no further action to resolve the debt \nuntil he received the SOR. Evidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment \nof debts only under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants who begin \nto address their security-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at \nstake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. \nMay 30, 2018). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant received financial counseling in \nconnection with his two bankruptcies, but his financial situation is not under control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcies were a lawful course \nof action, but bankruptcy does not qualify as a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d to resolve debts. ISCR \nCase No. 11-08274 (App. Bd. May 2, 2013). He has made no payments on the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o. He has made only four of the ten payments \nrequired for his student loan rehabilitation program. Based on his financial track record, \nI am not convinced that he will adhere to any payment schedule that is eventually \nnegotiated for his delinquent student loans, even if he completes the rehabilitation \nprogram.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant denied liability for the debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, and 1.o, but he submitted no documentary evidence showing a \n\n \n9 \n \nlegitimate basis for disputing them and no documentary evidence showing that he filed \ndisputes with the creditors, collection agencies, or credit bureaus.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . . \u201c The following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline are potentially applicable:3 \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . : any \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior . . . : \n \n \nThe SOR alleges, \u201c[Y]ou were terminated from your employment as a \ngovernment employee with [a military command] during your probationary period.\u201d On \nits face, this allegation does not allege any circumstances that would raise security \nconcerns. It alleges only the fact of termination and not the basis for it. A termination \nbecause of ineptitude, lack of required skills, or similar reasons would not raise security \nconcerns. However, Applicant was not misled by this defective pleading, because the \nletter notifying him of his termination set out the factual basis for it. \n \n \nApplicant contends that he was terminated in retaliation for reporting misconduct \nby his supervisor. Adjudication of the propriety of his termination is beyond the \njurisdiction of DOHA, and the record is inadequate to determine whether Applicant \ncommitted the insubordinate acts asserted in the termination letter. Based on the limited \n                                                          \n3 Applicant\u2019s false answer to the question in his SCA about failure to timely file or pay taxes was not \nalleged in the SOR and may not be an independent basis for revoking his security clearance, although a \nfalse answer could be considered for the purposes set out in footnote 2 above. However, I am satisfied \nthat Applicant did not intentionally falsify his SCA. \n\n \n10 \n \nrecord, I am not convinced that Applicant engaged in conduct that would raise security \nconcerns. I conclude that no disqualifying conditions under this guideline are \nestablished. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).4  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 20(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has refuted the \nallegation about his personal conduct, but he has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.o: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                                                          \n4 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The DOD acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 \n(AG). \n \nApplicant answered (Answer) the SOR on November 7, 2018, and he requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on March 26, 2019, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on April 10, 2019. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list was \n \n\n \n2 \n \nidentified as hearing exhibit (HE) I. Applicant testified and offered two exhibits (AE A-B), \nwhich were admitted without objection. The record remained open until May 10, 2019, \nto allow Applicant to submit documentary evidence. He submitted AE C through G, \nwhich were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nApril 26, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, with explanations, and his admissions \nare incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in November 2016. He served in the Air Force from 1982 until 1995 \nwhen he was passed over for promotion to major. He separated with an honorable \ndischarge. He joined the Air Force Reserve in 1998 and earned a retirement. In 2003, \nhe deployed to Iraq, while a reservist, and was awarded a meritorious service medal for \nhis actions. He begins receiving retired pay later this month when he turns 60 years old. \nHe has a master\u2019s degree. He was married in 1982 and divorced in 1994. He remarried \nin 1995 and divorced in 2016. He has eight children from both marriages. Two are \nminors for whom he pays child support.1  \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant: filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in August 1996, \nwhich resulted in a discharge in November 1996; filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition \nin October 2002, which was dismissed in May 2003; and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \npetition in May 2003, which resulted in a discharge in November 2006. The SOR also \nalleged the following delinquent debts: a consumer collection debt of approximately \n$17,249; a collection account to a state for unpaid child support of approximately \n$1,054; a delinquent debt from a deficiency on a repossessed car of approximately \n$13,149; and two delinquent medical debts of approximately $1,599 and $105. The \nbankruptcies are supported by court filings and the debts were listed in credit reports \nfrom March 2017 and July 2018.2  \n \n \nApplicant credibly explained that he filed his 1996 Chapter 7 bankruptcy because \nof debts he incurred during his first marriage. His 2002 Chapter 13 bankruptcy was filed \nand soon dismissed for a procedural irregularity. It was refiled in May 2003 and the \nrepayment plan was successfully completed leading to Applicant\u2019s discharge of debts in \nNovember 2006. Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2002-2003 because after \u201c9-11\u201d he \nwent through a period of unemployment and underemployment leading to his financial \ndifficulties. He has had no further bankruptcy filings.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 6, 20-21, 23, 25; GE 1. \n \n2 GE 1-6. \n \n3 Tr. at 21-24; Answer. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe status of his delinquent debts is as follows: \n \n \nChild Support-$1,054 (SOR 1.f). Applicant credibly explained that he became \ndelinquent on his child support when he was laid off from his job in February 2015 and \ncould only secure a minimum wage job until he was hired by his current employer in \nNovember 2016. At one point his arrearages were approximately $10,000. He \ndocumented that automatic payments from his paycheck have paid the arrearages and \nthat he is current on his monthly child support payments of approximately $366. This \ndebt is being resolved.4 \n \n \nConsumer account-$17,249 (SOR 1.d). Applicant credibly explained that this \nwas an SUV trailer that he and his wife purchased during his second marriage. At some \npoint he was unable to make the payments and it was repossessed. He documented \nthat any remaining obligation was assumed by his ex-wife and that she included this \ndebt in her 2014 Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This debt is resolved.5 \n \n \nRepossession account-$13,149 (SOR 1.h). Applicant credibly disputed that this \nwas a repossession account. He admitted that he got behind on his car payments and \nthe bank intended to repossess this car, but his father secured a loan to pay the car \nloan and Applicant reimbursed his father. He documented the payment to pay the car \nloan. This debt is resolved.6 \n \n \nMedical accounts-$1,599; $105 (SOR 1.e and 1.g). Applicant incurred these \nmedical bills when he was out of work. He talked to the providing facility and it indicated \nthe bill would be taken care of. When he was made aware the debts were on his credit \nreport, he disputed the debts. Those disputes are documented on his credit report. \nThese debts are being resolved.7 \n \n \nApplicant provided a written budget, which shows that he has a monthly residual \nof approximately $200. He begins receiving his military retirement pay of approximately \n$3,300 monthly in June 2019, which will up his monthly residual amount. Although a \npast-due amount is reflected on his most recent credit report for a mortgage (not alleged \nin the SOR), that debt is the responsibility of his second ex-wife as indicated in their \ndivorce settlement. He received financial counseling as part of his bankruptcy. \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 job appraisal rated him an overall \u201c4\u201d indicative of his \u201chigh \nperformance.\u201d8  \n \n \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 25-26, 33, 35; Answer (attachment 9); AE A. \n \n5 Tr. at 31-33; AE G (see Schedule F, p. 16 of 37). \n \n6 Tr. at 37-39; Answer; AE D. \n \n7 Tr. at 28-29; Answer; GE 8. \n \n8 Tr. at 29-30, 43; Answer (attachment 5); AE C, F. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nApplicant had debts discharged in 1996 and 2006 through bankruptcy. He also \nincurred debts that he was unable to pay and became delinquent. I find both the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s last bankruptcy was a Chapter 13 in 2006 and he successfully \nhonored the terms of his payment plan to discharge any qualifying debts. He \ndocumented that he paid or was not responsible for the remaining debts, including the \nmedical debts, which he disputed. He credibly testified that his most recent debts were \ndue to his second divorce and periods of unemployment and underemployment. Once \nhe became gainfully employed, he set about to honor his obligations by taking \nresponsible actions. All the above mitigating conditions have some applicability. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.       \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service, including his deployment to Iraq, his \nfederal contractor service, his work appraisal, and the circumstances surrounding his \nindebtedness.  \n\n \n7 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs: 1.a - 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRobert E.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 15, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. DOD CAF acted under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG), effective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on December 14, 2018. He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 17, 2019. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApril 24, 2019, with a hearing date of May 29, 2019. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. GE 1 was admitted into \nevidence without objection, but GE 2 was objected to and withdrawn by Department \nCounsel. An exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I and the Government\u2019s \ndiscovery letter was marked as HE II. The Government\u2019s request to take administrative \nnotice of certain facts about the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) was marked as HE \nIII. Applicant testified, presented two witnesses, and offered exhibits (AE) A-F, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 10, \n2019.  \n  \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by withdrawing SOR \u00b6 1.a. The \nmotion was granted and my formal findings will reflect that allegation was withdrawn. \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice of \ncertain facts relating to the PRC. Applicant did not object and the request was granted. \nThe request and the attached documents were not admitted into evidence but were \nincluded in the record as HE III. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the \nFindings of Fact, below. (Tr. 8-9) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, and extended family \nmembers are citizens and residents of China (PRC). It also alleged that Applicant has \none friend who is a citizen of Nigeria, but a resident of the PRC, and other friends who \nare citizens and residents of the PRC. \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the SOR allegations, with \nexplanations. The admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 27 years old. He was born in the United States. He went to high \nschool and college in the United States. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry \nin 2013. He began working for a defense contractor in information systems in January \n2017. (Tr. 24-25, 28-29; GE 1)  \n \n \nIn September 2013, Applicant took a position teaching English at a university in \nthe PRC. He remained in the position until January 2016 when his contract ended. He \nwas paid by the university. Applicant learned Mandarin Chinese, both written and \nspoken, in high school and college. Applicant met his wife (W) in December 2013 while \nin the PRC working. They met through a computer-dating-application. They dated and \nthen in 2014 decided to marry. They married in February 2016 in the United States. W \nwas born in the PRC. She is a college graduate with a degree in economics from a PRC \nuniversity. She came to the United States in 2016 on a fianc\u00e9e Visa (K1) and has \nrecently obtained her resident alien (green card) status. She intends to seek U.S. \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncitizenship when she is eligible. She works two jobs as a server in two restaurants in the \nUnited States. One of the restaurants is owed by Applicant\u2019s parents. W testified that \nshe is close to her parents, but closer to her in-laws with whom she and her husband \nlive. (Tr. 29-31, 34-42; Answer; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are U.S. citizens and residents. W has several \nfamily members who are citizens of and reside in the PRC. Those family members \ninclude: \n \n \nW\u2019s father (F) and mother (M). F is a retired music teacher. He continues to \nteach music. M is retired from her position at a local television station. According to \nApplicant, neither have any PRC government affiliations. Both F and M know Applicant \nworks in the IT field. Applicant sees F and M on a yearly basis, either by going to the \nPRC or having his in-laws come to the United States. Applicant intends to keep this \nschedule in the future. Applicant\u2019s other contact with them is by video chats that W sets \nup. His and W\u2019s contact through this communication is approximately two to three times \na month. (Tr. 43-45, 67-69; 101-102; Ans.) \n \n \nW\u2019s sister (S). S is a piano teacher at a university in the PRC. Applicant stated \nthat he communicates with S monthly. W stated that she communicates with S \u201coften\u201d \nusing social media platforms. Both Applicant and W acknowledged that S is a current \nmember of the Communist Party. W believes S joined the party to advance her career. \n(Tr. 45, 69-70, 85, 105-106; GE 1) \n \n \nW\u2019s other relatives in the PRC. The SOR did not specifically list by name or \nrelationship any other of W\u2019s relatives living in the PRC. The evidence does not support \nthat there is a sufficient connection between Applicant (through W) and these unnamed \nrelatives to cause a concern. (Tr. 45, 103-104; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend (F) living in the PRC, a citizen of Nigeria. Applicant met F \nwhile working in the PRC from 2013 to 2106. He invited F to his second wedding \nceremony, which was held in the PRC in 2017. Applicant\u2019s last contact with F was about \nthree months ago. He has monthly contact with F through social media. (Tr. at 47-48; \nAns.; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s other friends and associates who are citizens and residents of \nthe PRC. The SOR did not specifically list by name or relationship any other of \nApplicant\u2019s friends and associates living in the PRC. The evidence does not support that \nthere is a sufficient connection between Applicant and these unnamed relatives to \ncause a concern. (Tr. 52-53, 73-74; Ans.; GE1)  \n \nJob Performance, Financial, and Character Evidence \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2017 and 2018 job appraisals rated him as \u201cexceeds expectations.\u201d \nHe received two promotions in approximately two years. He also received an \noutstanding achievement award. He does not own a home, but lives with his parents. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nHe is a registered voter in his home county and he has paid into Social Security. His \nmonthly budget shows a net remainder of approximately $1,196. He testified that he has \napproximately $10,000 in a retirement account. Applicant\u2019s mother testified that he is a \nloyal U.S. citizen and a wonderful son. Applicant presented sworn declarations by \nsupervisors, coworkers, and friends on both his and W\u2019s behalf. They express faith that \nApplicant will properly handle classified information and recommended that he be \ngranted a security clearance. (Tr. 125; Answer (attached exhibits A-K); AE A-F) \n \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China   \n \n \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese \nCommunist Party. The PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights, suppresses \npolitical dissent, and its practices include arbitrary arrest and detention, forced \nconfessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Repression and coercion, \nparticularly against organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public \ninterest issues, are routine.   \n \nThe PRC is one of the most aggressive countries in targeting sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology, and economic intelligence. It has targeted the U.S. with \nactive intelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. In China, authorities have \nmonitored telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, \nand internet communications. Authorities opened and censored mail. The security \nservices routinely monitored and entered residences and offices to gain access to \ncomputers, telephones, and fax machines. All major hotels had a sizable internal \nsecurity presence, and hotel guestrooms were sometimes bugged and searched for \nsensitive or proprietary materials. As recently as March 2017, a state department \nemployee was charged with failing to report repeated contacts with PRC foreign \nintelligence agents who provided her and her family with thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of \ngifts and benefits over five years. (HE III) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law, mother-in-law, and sister-in-law are citizens and \nresidents of the PRC. His sister-in-law is currently a member of the Communist Party. \nThe PRC is a communist country with a poor human rights record. It is one of the \nworld\u2019s most aggressive nations in the collection of U.S. intelligence and sensitive \neconomic information. Because of the PRC\u2019s posture in these areas, Applicant\u2019s in-\nlaws\u2019 connection to the PRC, and his sister-in-law\u2019s Communist Party affiliation, there \nexists a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The same situation also creates a potential conflict of interest for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised by the evidence. Applicant\u2019s marriage to W and \nher connections to her family in the PRC cause the application of AG \u00b6 7(c). Applicant\u2019s \nconnection to his friend who is a resident of the PRC, but a citizen of Nigeria has little \nsecurity significance, thus alleviating any heightened risk or potential conflict of interest. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor, as is SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \n \nBased upon the documented action of the PRC in attempting to gain intelligence \nfrom U.S. sources, the evidence does not support that it is unlikely that Applicant could \nbe placed in a position to choose between the interests of his in-laws in the PRC and \nthose of the United States. Additionally, his sister-in-law\u2019s Communist Party affiliation \nplaces Applicant in a susceptible position. The evidence supports that he has a deep \nand longstanding relation with the United States, however, he also spent over two years \nworking in the PRC and married W who has extensive ties to the PRC. Applicant could \nbe put into a situation where he has to choose between the interests of his in-laws in the \nPRC and the United States. The evidence does not unequivocally support that he would \nresolve all conflicts in favor of the United States. As stated above, the protection of the \nnational security is the paramount consideration and any doubt must be resolved in \nfavor of national security. I am unable to find either of the mitigating conditions to be \nfully applicable. Despite the presence of some mitigation, it is insufficient to overcome \nthe significant security concerns that exist.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nThe PRC has an authoritarian government, a bad human rights record, and a \nvery aggressive espionage program aimed at the United States. The nature of a \nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States. There is no reason to \n\n \n8 \n \n \nquestion Applicant\u2019s loyalty and devotion to this country. However, he has not overcome \nthe vulnerability to pressure, coercion, exploitation, and duress created by W\u2019s relatives \nliving in the PRC.  \n \n \nApplicant has done nothing whatsoever to question his loyalty and devotion to \nthis country. However, he has simply been unable to overcome the heavy burden of \nshowing that he is not subject to influence by the PRC. His vulnerability to foreign \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress remains a concern.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Foreign Influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations. (Item 1.)  The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the DoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 11, 2019. He admitted the SOR allegations \nand requested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record \nwithout a hearing. (Item 2.) On May 8, 2019, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \ncontaining five exhibits, was sent to the Applicant and received on May 20, 2019. The \n\n \n2 \n \nFORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM.  Applicant responded to the FORM on June 13, 3019 and submitted a large \npacket of documents, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, which was admitted into \nevidence without objection.  DOHA assigned the case to me on June 18, 2019. Items 1 \nthrough 5 are admitted into evidence and hereinafter referred to as Government \nExhibits 1 through 5.     \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 60 years old.  He is married with three adult children.  He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree.  He holds the position of Chief Operating Officer with a defense \ncontractor and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.   \n  \nThe SOR identified two allegations under this guideline concerning Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2008 through 2017.  \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits each of the allegations.  Applicant states \nthat he has no excuse for failing to file his income tax returns for so many years.        \n \n \nApplicant has been married for 34 years and has three adult children.  He states \nthat he has always met his financial obligations and has never lived beyond his means.  \nIn 2009, Applicant was one of thousands of victims effected by an elaborate, now \nfamous, \u201cponzi scheme\u201d engineered by the chairman of a large financial firm.  That \nchairman is now in prison.  Applicant had been a financial advisor at the firm from \nMarch 2009 to December 2009 with his business partners, when Federal authorities \nseized the firm.  Applicant resigned from his position and was unemployed for the next \n11 months.  With his business ruined, he returned to the commercial real estate \nbusiness.   \n \n \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years, 2008, 2009, \n2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  He also failed to file his state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and \n2017.  He has no excuse for not timely filing his Federal and state income tax returns.  \nIn the years from 2008 to 2012, he states that he did not have any net taxable liability to \nthe Federal government or the state.  As time passed, he failed to organize himself and \nprocrastinated on filing, which eventually snowballed into his current situation.  He \nrationalized that since he did not owe much, if anything, to the taxing authorities, he \n\n \n3 \n \nwould get to it the next year.  He found that tracking down the information after so long \nwithout filing was difficult.       \n \n \nIn November 2016, Applicant started his current job that he understood would \nrequire a security clearance.  In January 2019, Applicant filed all past-due Federal and \nstate income tax returns.  Applicant has made all payments including late filing penalties \nto the state.  Applicant also learned that his procrastination cost him a refund he would \nhave received for six years out of the ten that he failed to file.  Applicant states that he \nhas also filed his Federal income tax returns in question and has paid all taxes owed \nincluding penalties except for 2017, which he expected to pay in the near future.  \nApplicant believes that his failure to file his income tax returns in a timely manner has \ncost him approximately $60,000 in tax refunds.  \n \nApplicant regrets his past misconduct and is remorseful about his failure as a \ncitizen to pay his taxes and file his income tax returns on time. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d  The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same.  \n \n  \nApplicant is a procrastinator who did not file his state or Federal income tax \nreturns on time from 2008 to 2017.  There is no excuse for this misconduct.  Applicant \nhas not demonstrated the high degree of judgment, reliability and trustworthiness \nrequired to hold a security clearance.       \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n  \n(e) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n  \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here.  Applicant states that he \nunderstands the importance of filing his income tax returns on time, but he has not been \ndiligent and responsible over the years to file them.  For ten years he did not file his \nstate or Federal income tax returns.  During this period, he established a pattern of \nfailing to comply with Federal and state law that required him to do so.  Just this year, \nhe filed all of his state and Federal income tax returns in question.  He states that he \nhas also paid the back taxes owed and penalties associated with his late filings. \nApplicant\u2019s procrastination is no excuse for this misconduct.  He waited too long to do \nanything and has not shown good judgment over the years.  Although he has now filed \nhis income tax returns and has paid the back taxes and penalties owed, there is no \npattern of good judgment or reliability.  His pattern of conduct has not demonstrated \nsufficient good judgment and reliability to show that he has earned the privilege to be \neligible for access to classified information, or that he will continue to abide by the rules \nand regulations required of him while holding a security clearance.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He denies the risk of \nrecurrence, but concerns persist about his personal conduct. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nOn October 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline E, personal conduct, which explained why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility \nfor him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective June 8, 2017, to all adjudications for national security eligibility or eligibility to hold \na sensitive position. \n\n2 \n \nOn November 7, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). On April 10, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to \ndetermine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant. On April 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for May 6, 2019. \nCounsel for Applicant entered his appearance on May 2, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, before the introduction of any evidence, the SOR was amended at \nthe Government\u2019s motion without any objection from Applicant, as set forth below. Seven \nGovernment exhibits (GEs 1-7) and 18 Applicant exhibits (AEs A-R) were admitted into \nevidence. A January 17, 2019 letter forwarding copies of the proposed Government \nexhibits (GEs) and a list of the GEs were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs I-II) for the \nrecord, but not admitted in evidence. Applicant and two witnesses testified (the witnesses \nby telephone), as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on June 4, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \n \nBefore the introduction of any evidence, the Government moved to amend the SOR \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive to conform to Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR and the \nevidence to be presented at the hearing. Applicant had no objection. Accordingly, I granted \nthe motion and amended SOR \u00b6 1.b to allege as follows: \n \nb. You resigned in lieu of termination from your employment at [employer \nname omitted] in March 2015, after your employer discovered that you were \ncalling in sick in order to perform military duties, as set forth in subparagraph \n1.a, above. \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel requested that the testimony of Applicant\u2019s \nwitnesses be taken by telephone. Neither Applicant nor his attorney had alerted me \nbeforehand about any planned witness testimony or about any issue with the hearing\u2019s \nlocation, which was well within 150 miles of Applicant\u2019s residence. The Government had \nnot been notified about an issue with the witnesses\u2019 availability on the hearing date, and \nobjected if they were to be fact witnesses. The Government had no objection if they were \nto be character witnesses. I allowed the testimonies to proceed after indicating that I would \nconsider a request to reconvene the hearing for in-person testimony, if necessary. After \nhearing their direct testimonies, the Government exercised its right of cross-examination \nand did not request a continuance. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder the amended SOR, Applicant is alleged under Guideline E (SOR \u00b6 1.a) to \nhave been convicted by court-martial of larceny in violation of Article 121 of the Uniformed \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) for theft of government funds between August 1, 2013, \nand February 28, 2014, and for conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman in \nviolation of Article 133 of the UCMJ for calling in sick to his civilian employer so that he \ncould perform his military duties between August 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014. Applicant is \n\n3 \n \nseparately alleged to have resigned in lieu of termination in March 2015 from his civilian \nemployment with a commercial airline after the company discovered that he was calling in \nsick to perform military duties (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In his response to the SOR, Applicant \nacknowledged and expressed regret for the conduct, for which he was convicted at a court-\nmartial proceeding. He explained that he resigned from his employment with a commercial \nairline in lieu of being terminated for using accrued \u201cPaid-Time-Off (PTO) to fulfill his other \nobligations.\u201d Applicant submitted in mitigation that he reimbursed the overpayments of \nmilitary pay when he learned of them, and indicated that both his military and subsequent \ncivilian employers have been made aware of the legal proceedings and continue to trust \nhim to protect classified information. (Answer.) \n \n \nAfter considering Applicant\u2019s Answer, the exhibits, and the hearing transcript, I make \nthe following findings of fact: \n \nApplicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor with a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree earned in June 1993 from a U.S. military academy. He met his spouse at the \nacademy, and they married shortly after she graduated in June 1994. They have an 18-\nyear-old daughter and a 16-year-old son. They have owned their present residence since \nJune 2013. (GE 1; AE C; Tr.37.) \n \nApplicant held a DOD Secret clearance, which was granted to him in 1989. On his \ngraduation from the military academy, his clearance was upgraded to Top Secret. He \nserved on active duty as an officer in a branch of the U.S. military from June 1993 through \nDecember 2002. He distinguished himself as a pilot assigned to a fighter squadron, and \nwas awarded achievement or commendation medals in 1996, 2000, and 2002. In January \n2003, he was transferred in the active reserve to the Air National Guard (ANG), serving \npart-time as a traditional reservist initially, in state X\u2019s ANG through July 2013. He received \nan achievement medal in 2006 for sustained meritorious achievement as a pilot for state \nX\u2019s ANG from September 2003 to November 2004. He transitioned to drone pilot in 2006. \nIn July 2010, he was awarded achievement medals with a third oakleaf cluster for \ncompleting 20 combat missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation \nIraqi Freedom between July 2008 and October 2008 and a fourth oakleaf cluster for \nsurveillance and reconnaissance as a drone pilot in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom \nbetween May 2010 and July 2010. (GEs 1, 7; AEs A, D; Tr. 38, 44.) In January 2009, \nApplicant was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. (AE A.) \n \nApplicant worked in the civilian sector as a part-time airline pilot for a commercial \nairline starting in May 2003. His base airport was a distant state (state Y). In June 2013, \nApplicant and his family relocated, to be closer to his civilian employment. He and his \nspouse bought a fixer-upper and began remodeling the house at a cost of approximately \n$213,000. From August 2013 through December 2013, Applicant or his spouse wrote \nmultiple checks to various contractors working on their home. In September 2013, his \nparents loaned him $183,032 to help pay for the renovations. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 44, 87-88.) \n   \nIn August 2013, Applicant underwent a transfer of duty station to an ANG base in \nstate Y. He was on Title 10 active-duty orders from August 19, 2013, through April 17, \n\n4 \n \n2014. He continued to pilot for the commercial airline, and at times called in sick to the \nairline so that he could perform military duties. He continued to be paid by state X\u2019s ANG \nthrough direct deposit into his checking account through February 2014, even though he \nwas performing and being compensated for duty in state Y under Title 10 active-duty \norders. He received government overpayments of $67,301 from August 2013 through \nFebruary 2014 before the error was discovered in February 2014, during an annual audit to \ndetermine whether military members were collecting compensation from both the active \nduty and reserve duty compensation systems. (GEs 3-5, 7; AE B; Tr. 44, 87-89.) Applicant \ndid not self-report any overpayment to the government before being confronted.1 Applicant \nattributes the overpayment to \u201ca glitch\u201d in the military\u2019s finance department. He denies that \nhe took an affirmative action to cause the overpayment. (Tr. 47-48.) \n \nThe military conducted a special investigation into the suspected fraudulent \ncollection of an estimated $73,713 in government overpayments by Applicant. In early April \n2014, Applicant was interviewed by a special agent. He waived his right to legal counsel \nand in writing stated in part: \n \nI am not sure how this happened or was I aware that this happened. I do pay \nattention to our finances, but my wife runs the checking account and over the \nlast 10 months  . . . we have been doing some significant remodeling. In \norder to accomplish this remodel we took a loan from my parents in \nSeptember of 2013. It was a significant amount to get the home back into \nshape. Approximately $150,000 was loaned to us in order to complete the \nremodel, then we would refinance the home and pay my parents back. Since \nthere were sufficient funds in our account and that I was still paid on the 1st \nand 15th, I assume this is why my wife did not say anything, except at one \npoint she mentioned a large amount and I thought it was from my first TDY \npayment. Obviously, I am in a shocked and stressed state of mind. (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the special agent that he and his spouse were in the process \nof remodeling their home, and that he did not have the $73,713 available for repayment. \nHe subsequently provided documentation showing thousands of dollars in checks written to \nremodeling contractors and a wire transfer confirmation showing his receipt of $183,032 \nfrom his mother. A review of records showed that he had viewed each instance of \noverpayment by accessing his leave and earning statements online. (GE 3.) After an audit \nby Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), he was found to have received \n$67,301 in overpayments.  Applicant asserts that he satisfied the debt in December 2014. \n(Tr. 46, 55.) Available documentation from DFAS dated November 2, 2017, corroborates \nsatisfaction of a $67,301 debt (AE B), but it does not indicate any payment dates. (Tr. 93.) \n \n \nThe military notified Applicant\u2019s civilian employer that he had, at times between \nAugust 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, performed ANG duties while being on paid leave from \n                                                 \n1 Applicant self-reported the information on his SF 86, but there is no evidence that he brought the \noverpayment itself to the attention of the military. It was somewhat disingenuous of Applicant to claim that \n\u201ceverything from my understanding that has come from this was due to my telling the government about \neverything.\u201d (Tr. 40.) \n\n5 \n \nthe airline due to claimed illness. (GE 7.) Applicant testified that he \u201cgot caught up in a little \nbit of the mentality personally, if, if [he] need[ed] a day off, [he] just need[ed] to call in sick.\u201d \n(Tr. 50.) In March 2015, Applicant resigned from the airline in lieu of being terminated. \n(GEs 1, 7; Tr. 99.) In August 2015, Applicant began working for a defense contractor as a \ndrone instructor pilot. Applicant testified that he disclosed to his new civilian employer \n\u201ceverything that happened.\u201d  (GE 1; Tr. 64-66.) \n \n \nIn July 2015, Applicant was charged by the military with violating Article 121 of the \nUCMJ, for \u201csteal[ing] money, military property, of a value exceeding $500, the property of \nthe United States\u201d between August 1, 2013, and February 28, 2014. Applicant was also \ncharged with conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, in violation of Article 133 of \nthe UCMJ, for wrongfully and dishonorably representing, on diverse occasions between \nAugust 1, 2013, and April 30, 2014, to his commercial airline employer that he could not \nreport to work due to illness when he was performing military duties. Applicant pleaded not \nguilty to the charges. (GEs 4-7; Tr. 45-46, 53-55.) Article 121 of the UCMJ (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n921) provides: \n \n(a) Any person subject to this chapter who wrongfully takes, obtains, or \nwithholds, by any means, from the possession of the owner or of any other \nperson any money, personal property, or article of value of any kind\u2014 \n  \n(1) with intent to permanently deprive or defraud another person of the use \nand benefit of property or to appropriate it to its own use or the use of any \nperson other than the owner, steals that property and is guilty of larceny; or  \n \n(2) with intent temporarily to deprive of defraud another person of the use \nand benefit of property or to appropriate it to his own use or the use of any \nperson other person other than the owner, is guilty of wrongful appropriation.  \n \n  \nArticle 133 of the UCMJ (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 933) provides: \n \nAny commissioned officer, cadet, or midshipman who is convicted of conduct \nunbecoming an officer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial \nmay direct. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of both charges at a general court-martial proceeding in \nSeptember 2016. The elements for larceny (Article 121(a)(1)) are that the accused \nwrongfully took, obtained, or withheld certain property from the possession of the owner or \nof any other person; the property belonged to a certain person (here the U.S. government); \nthe property was of a certain value, or of some value; and the taking, obtaining or \nwithholding was with the intent permanently to deprive or defraud another person of the \nuse and benefit of the property or permanently to appropriate the property for the use of \nthe accused or for any person other than the owner. (GE 6.) Applicant was sentenced to \nserve 15 days confinement; to pay a fine of $25,000; and to receive an official reprimand. \nApplicant served five days in a local jail, apparently two days in a psychiatric ward and then \nthree days in solitary confinement for his own protection, which was determined sufficient \n\n6 \n \nto satisfy the jail sentence. (GEs 4, 7; Tr. 53, 56.) In November 2016, his commanding \nmajor general issued an official reprimand to Applicant, stating in part: \n \nYou are hereby reprimanded. As an officer in the United States [military] you \nare held to the highest standards of personal and professional conduct \u2013 \nboth on and off duty. You must serve as the epitome of integrity, setting a \nstandard of conduct and professionalism that can be followed by others. \nYour conviction for stealing over $79,000 [sic] from the [U.S. military] and \nclaiming sick leave with your civilian employer while performing military duty \nis shocking, not only for an officer, but for anyone wearing the uniform. The \ndeliberate, repetitive and selfish nature of your conduct displayed a total \ndisregard for [military] standards and for the law. Your behavior is \nreprehensible, and it cannot and will not be tolerated. (GE 5.) \n \n \nAt his security clearance hearing held on May 6, 2019, Applicant testified, \u201cI take \n100 percent responsibility that the court-martial findings were accurate.\u201d (Tr. 73.) However, \nhe also maintained that he did not realize he received the overpayments exceeding \n$10,000 each month for about six months until he was confronted by the military \ninvestigators. He cited several factors: multiple changes in his military orders; pay from the \ncommercial airline that was never the same; changes in his ANG pay because of times in \ntransition and times in training; TDY expenses; and \u201cquite a bit of money flowing through \n[his and his spouse\u2019s] checking account going to contractors and coming in from multiple \nsources.\u201d (Tr. 45.) He denied that he had any intention to steal the money or withhold the \noverpayments. (Tr. 47.) He asserted that his mistake was that he got too busy, too out of \ncontrol to where he failed to pay attention. (Tr. 49.) On cross-examination, he was asked to \nexplain how he could have failed to notice the overpayments, given he had viewed his LES \nfor each pay period. He responded in part: \n \nSo when I saw [state X\u2019s] pay, I understood that to be [state Y\u2019s] pay, and the \n[state Y] pay was accurate pay but it wasn\u2019t pay on the 1st and 15th, like you \nget paid in the military. [State Y\u2019s] pay was [at] different times of the month \nbecause of those changing of orders. At the same time, I was getting TDY \npay, I was getting [commercial airline] pay. So even though I had looked at \nDFAS, I didn\u2019t gather that one was from [state Y] and one was from [state X]. \nAnd so you\u2019re right, I mean, how would anybody not know, but with that large \ncheck from my mother in the account with multiple sources of income coming \nin, I didn\u2019t focus . . . . (Tr. 89.) \n \n \nHe testified that he was focused on the outlays for the contractors. (Tr. 90.)  When \nasked about his LES, Applicant explained that he was \u201cgoing through training, so there was \ntemporary duty pay and other pay also.\u201d However, he also admitted that TDY pay would \nnot have been reflected on the LES. (Tr. 102.)  \n \n  \nAt his security clearance hearing, Applicant estimated that he called in sick to the \ncommercial airline to perform military duties \u201cthree to five times.\u201d (Tr. 95.) He \nacknowledged that his employer would have allowed him time off to permit military duty. \n\n7 \n \nInstead of notifying his employer at the last minute as military duty obligations arose, \nApplicant admitted it was easier to do what he did. (Tr. 96-97.) He was aware that it was \nagainst company policy. (Tr. 97.) Applicant recognized that there was a problem with him \nlying to the commercial airline in telling them that he was ill and unable to fly (Tr. 99), but \nhe wanted the Government to know that had used accrued PTO. (Tr. 51.) About it being \ncommon practice, he responded, \u201cI know multiple friends of mine and people that have \ndone that. Again, it\u2019s a culture that I let myself slide into.\u201d (Tr. 52-53.) He expressed regret \nfor the behavior. (Tr. 53.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility was suspended in October 2018 because of \nthe conduct that led to the court-marital. (Tr. 36; AEs G-H.) Applicant was allowed to \nremain in the U.S. military as a traditional reservist, and he was on duty one weekend a \nmonth and two weeks a year. (Tr. 86.) In mid-February 2018, he was released from active \nduty, having completed required active service. His service was characterized as \nhonorable. He retired after completing over 19 years on active duty and over four years of \ninactive service. (AE A; Tr. 39, 77.) \n \n \nSince November 2016, Applicant and his spouse have had their own business. They \njointly own a used-clothing store, for which they paid a $25,000 franchise fee. They \nobtained a $200,000 business loan, on which they have paid $50,000. (GE 1; Tr. 72, 77-\n79.) Applicant was named as contract instructor of the year for 2016 by the ANG. (AE E; \nTr. 70.) \n \n \nOn April 12, 2018, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) to renew his security clearance \neligibility. In response to police record inquiries, he listed his September 2016 convictions \nof the Article 121 and Article 133 charges, indicating with respect to Article 121 that he was \nconvicted of larceny, and that he was sentenced to 15 days confinement, a $25,000 fine, \nand a reprimand. (GE 1.) \n \n \nOn June 5, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). About his resignation from his employment with \nthe commercial airline in March 2015, Applicant indicated that the ANG notified the airline \nabout his conduct, \u201cwhich painted [him] in a bad light.\u201d He explained that it was \u201ccommon \npractice\u201d for pilots to call in sick when they need leave, and that, on one occasion, he \ncalled in sick to his civilian employer and reported to an ANG drill weekend to work, \nalthough he now does not think that he told the investigator that he called in sick only once \nto perform his military duties. (Tr. 97.) He admitted knowing that it was against company \npolicy. About his larceny conviction, Applicant stated that when he out-processed from \nstate X\u2019s ANG, some of the paperwork must not have been submitted appropriately \nbecause state X\u2019s ANG did not stop paying him, which resulted in an overpayment to him \nof approximately $65,000. He denied that he intentionally withheld any money. He \nexplained that he was entirely wrapped up in his work and his home remodel, and he did \nnot pay attention to the amounts being deposited into his bank account. Applicant indicated \nthat he began repaying the debt in July or August 2014, and it was satisfied in full in either \nDecember 2014 or January 2015. Applicant admitted that he had yet to satisfy his $25,000 \n\n8 \n \nfine because DFAS had not received any record of the fine and so could not charge him. \nHe claimed he had money set aside to pay the fine as soon as DFAS bills him. (GE 7.) \n \n \nApplicant completed a financial statement for the OPM investigator showing \nhousehold income of approximately $15,800 each month: $15,000 in combined military \nretirement and employment income for him and $800 in income for his spouse from her job \nteaching cycling classes at a local gym. Applicant and his spouse were taking no income \nfrom their used clothing business.  They had $450 per month in discretionary income after \npaying their routine expenses and budgeting $500 for car maintenance, entertainment, and \nemergencies. He admitted that he owed approximately $40,000 in credit card debt incurred \nbecause he received his military retirement pay only twice between December 2015 and \nJanuary 2017. He used credit cards to make up for the shortfall in his income. (GE 7.) \n \n   \nOn October 12, 2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant because of his \npersonal misconduct for which he was adjudged guilty in September 2016. In response to \nthe SOR, Applicant asserted that he did not notice the overpayments because of his \ncomplicated pay records caused by \u201cconstantly changing temporary (TDY) orders\u201d from \nstate Y\u2019s ANG. In addressing mitigation, he indicated that he accepts responsibility for his \n\u201cmistake\u201d in not realizing and alerting the ANG that he was being overpaid, and that he and \nhis spouse now closely monitor their finances and his payments from the U.S. government. \nHe admitted that there were occasions when he called in sick to his commercial airline \nemployer and used accrued PTO when he was on duty with his ANG unit, but asserted that \nthe practice was \u201csomewhat common in the airline industry.\u201d While he expressed regret for \nhis poor judgment and realizes that his conduct \u201cwas not fully truthful,\u201d he also stated that \nhe \u201clikely [has] been punished more severely than any other person who has ever called in \nsick in order to work two jobs (a court-marital).\u201d (Answer.) \n \n \nOn May 1, 2019, another defense contractor took over the contract to train drone \npilots at the ANG base. Applicant and his colleagues were hired by the company so their \nwork has continued without interruption. Applicant\u2019s duties require him to maintain a Secret \nclearance. (Tr. 34-35.) As of May 2019, the fine assessed at the court-marital proceeding \nhad not been paid. Applicant provided evidence of an email from DFAS dated August 30, \n2017, in response to an online inquiry from Applicant of August 29, 2017. In that email, \nDFAS indicated that its office of garnishment operations had no record of any court orders \nin his file and no record of a court judgment from September 2016. (AE R.) Applicant \ntestified that a few months after his sentencing, he contacted DFAS about the fine and \nsubmitted formal requests, but received emails saying there is nothing in the system. When \nabout to retire, he again inquired and received the same response. In terms of his emails to \nDFAS, Applicant testified that he is \u201cpretty positive\u201d that he did not reference the court \norder number in his correspondence. His attorney told him to have the money available to \npay the fine. He and his spouse currently plan to take a loan from a 401(k) account to pay \nthe fine. (Tr. 59-61, 83-84.) Applicant has not attempted to send DFAS a copy of the report \nof the court-martial proceeding, which shows the fine assessed. It was not suggested to \nhim by his counsel, and he did not think of it. (Tr. 82.) \n \n\n9 \n \nCharacter References \n \n \nContinuation of Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility is strongly endorsed by \nseveral current and former military officers, who have held or hold high levels of security \nclearance and are familiar with Applicant\u2019s military duty performance, his work as a \ncontract drone instructor pilot, or both. Applicant has given them no reason to doubt his \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness with regard to his willingness or ability to abide by \nsecurity regulations. (AEs F-K, N-Q.) \n \n \nAs a lieutenant in a fighter squadron from 1995 to 1997, Applicant was hardworking, \nand always the first to volunteer. A now retired lieutenant general, who commanded the \nsquadron at the time, indicates that Applicant was highly respected, and when he made a \nmistake, \u201che would own it.\u201d  He believes that despite the court-martial, Applicant \u201cremains \nas trustworthy, dedicated, and loyal\u201d as he was as a young lieutenant in the squadron. He \ntrusts Applicant \u201cimplicitly\u201d and has absolute faith in Applicant\u2019s ability to protect classified \ninformation. (AE K.) \n \n \nApplicant had no security incidents as a fighter pilot, a technician in the ANG, and \ncurrently as a government contractor. (AEs F-K, O-Q.) A colonel, who served alongside \nApplicant when they were both drone pilots for state X\u2019s ANG, witnessed Applicant take his \nsecurity responsibilities very seriously. (AE P.) \n \n \n Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor from 2014 to July 2017, throughout Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdaunting court-martial process,\u201d believes that \u201cthe offenses decided against [Applicant] \nwere an isolated and unintentional mistake for which [Applicant] has accepted the \nresponsibility and consequences of with grace and honor.\u201d This retired lieutenant colonel \nopined that Applicant \u201cshould not be subject to double jeopardy for those offenses with \nrespect to his security clearance.\u201d He has read the SOR and considers the security \nconcerns \u201ctenuous and untimely,\u201d given Applicant held a security clearance for some two \nyears after the court-martial conviction. (AE H.) \n \n \nA former military commander and now peer drone instructor at the state Y ANG \nbase also worked as a civilian pilot for the commercial airline from which Applicant \nresigned in March 2015. He respects the opinion of the general court-martial, but he \n\u201cvehemently\u201d disagrees that the events provide an appropriate characterization of \nApplicant. (AE I.) \n \n \nA colonel in the ANG, who has known Applicant since they were students at the \nmilitary academy, commanded Applicant during his trial and conviction in 2016. She has \nknown Applicant to be dedicated to his duty and successful and stable in all aspects, and \nattests that Applicant \u201cis not a liar.\u201d (AE J.) \n \n     \nTwo current co-workers, both retired colonels, testified by telephone and provided \naffidavits for Applicant. One is a fellow drone instructor pilot and the other is the site \nmanager for the contract drone instructors. The instructor pilot was the operations group \ncommander when Applicant was hired, initially part time, in August 2013. Because \n\n10 \n \nApplicant\u2019s performance was consistently strong, he entrusted Applicant with additional \nclassified duties, and Applicant never had a single incident of making even a clerical \nmistake regarding the protection of classified information. This co-worker knew that there \nwas a military investigation and adjudication, but he did not take part in the military\u2019s \ninvestigation of Applicant, and had no part in the military\u2019s recommendations. This co-\nworker was very impressed by Applicant\u2019s ability to handle a difficult situation with a \npositive attitude. The military trusted Applicant, ordering him back to active duty following \nthe court-martial, and Applicant continued to perform \u201cflawlessly.\u201d When confronted with \nthe evidence of overpayments and that Applicant had viewed his LES showing the \noverpayments, the co-worker indicated that he still considers Applicant trustworthy. He has \nhad no reason to doubt Applicant, who he submits \u201chas acknowledged all his behaviors \nand taken positive steps to alleviate any and all factors that may have contributed to a \nperception of inappropriate demeanor.\u201d (AE F; Tr. 105-125.) \n \n \nThe site manager, who currently supervises Applicant, considers him to be \u201ca \ndependable, trustworthy, and effective instructor at this site.\u201d Applicant made him aware of \nthe charges then pending against him over a year before the court-martial proceeding. \nBefore Applicant\u2019s \u201clegal troubles,\u201d Applicant taught an academic class at the Secret level \nwithout any adverse incidents. Applicant is consistently considered among the top \ninstructors by his students, other crew personnel inside the ground control station, and by \ntheir military customer. Regarding drone flights, Applicant follows \u201ca myriad of rules and \nregulations that govern the operation of [the drone] with no deviation and constantly makes \nquick decisions and exercises sound judgment during flying operations.\u201d After Applicant\u2019s \ncourt-martial conviction, the site manager asked the military squadron commander, group \ncommander, and wing commander whether Applicant could continue as an instructor pilot, \nsupervising students who drop laser-guided bombs on occasion. Applicant\u2019s commanders \nhad no reservations about continuing to trust Applicant to do the right thing. The site \nmanager indicates that Applicant has been careful to remind others that he cannot be \nexposed to classified information while his clearance is suspended. The site manager \nexpressed no reservations about Applicant holding a security clearance. He has \u201ccomplete \nfaith in him doing his job.\u201d Despite some extenuating circumstances, Applicant never \nsought to excuse his behavior. It was meaningful to the site manager that Applicant \nretained his rank and was not separated from the military after his court-martial conviction. \nThe site manager has seen other instances of egregious mistakes in pay made by the \nmilitary. The supervisor could not speak to whether Applicant should have been more \naggressive in trying to fix the error. Applicant made him aware that he was given jail time \nand a fine, but he had no knowledge about whether Applicant had paid his fine. (AE G; Tr. \n129-147.) \n \n  \nA friend of Applicant\u2019s for the past five or so years is employed as a clinical \npsychologist at a Veterans\u2019 Affairs healthcare facility. Applicant has impressed him as \nbeing focused and goal-oriented. Regarding the offenses, this psychologist stated that \nApplicant \u201cmay have been guilty of an isolated incident of poor decision-making in trying to \nbalance competing demands.\u201d He does not believe Applicant had any malicious intent, and \nconsiders Applicant\u2019s offense to be minor. In his experience, Applicant is someone who \ntakes pride in his professional and personal character. (AE M.) \n\n11 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n12 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern about personal conduct is articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate with \nsecurity processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in connection \nwith a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nApplicant was adjudged guilty at a September 2016 general court-martial \nproceeding of larceny of government funds in violation of Article 121 of the UCMJ and of \nconduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman in violation of Article 133 of the UCMJ. \nThe evidence shows that he retained some $67,301 (after DFAS audit) in military pay to \nwhich he was not entitled between August 2013 and February 2014. His conduct \nunbecoming an officer and a gentleman involved him wrongfully and dishonorably calling in \nsick on apparently three to five occasions to his then civilian employer, a commercial \nairline, when he was not ill so that he could perform military duties. His extremely poor \njudgment in two diverse aspects establishes the security concerns under AG \u00b6 15, and \nsupport \u201ca whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations,\u201d as \ncontemplated in disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d), which state: \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but \nwhich, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information; and \n \n\n13 \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is \nnot limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or \nresources. \n \nApplicant\u2019s court-martial larceny conviction could have been alleged under the \ncriminal conduct guideline, and so AG \u00b6 16(d) is not strictly applicable to his larceny of \ngovernment funds on that basis. Even so, it was clearly untrustworthy, inappropriate \nbehavior in violation of the UCMJ, and a recurrent misuse of Government resources. His \nlies to his civilian employer, in known violation of the commercial airline\u2019s sick leave policy, \nconstituted a pattern of dishonesty and rule violations. \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a personal with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n14 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with \nrules and regulations. \n \n \nMitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(b), 17(f), and 17(g) have no applicability. \nApplicant reported his convictions on his SF 86, but it is difficult to find the good-faith, \nprompt disclosure required for mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(a) when he made no effort to \ninform the government of the substantial overpayments to him when they were occurring or \nto correct his time records with his then civilian employer, who learned of his falsification of \nhis time from the military and not from Applicant. In a written statement provided to the \nmilitary during its investigation into the overpayments, Applicant admitted that, at one point, \nhis spouse mentioned a large amount in their bank account. Applicant indicated that he \nthought it was from his first TDY payment. He can be expected to have reasonably taken \nsteps to have made an inquiry into the source of the funds. \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies in that the personal conduct at issue occurred between August \n2013 and April 2014. Even so, the mitigating weight of the passage of time has to be \nweighed against the seriousness of the personal conduct and evidence that undermines \nhis claim of reform. It is significant in extenuation that Applicant did not take any action to \ncause the overpayments, but he is culpable for not bringing the error to the attention of the \ngovernment. The military officers who presided at his court-martial obviously did not believe \nhis denials of any knowledge of the overpayments, for they found him culpable of an \noffense that requires an intention to wrongfully withhold or deprive. Additionally, his false \nclaims of illness to his then civilian employer are no less serious because he had paid time \noff. He admitted that he could have requested the leave, but he acted out of expediency \nand self-interest in disregard of known company leave policies. The recurrent nature of his \nlarceny and false claims of illness is an aggravating factor that makes it difficult to conclude \nthat it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur. \n \n \nWith respect to reform under AG \u00b6 17(d), Applicant testified, \u201cI take 100 percent \nresponsibility that the court-martial findings were accurate.\u201d However, he also continues to \nmaintain that he did not realize the overpayments exceeding $10,000 each month for about \nsix months until he was confronted by the military investigators. He cited several factors: \nmultiple changes in his military orders; pay from the commercial airline that was never the \n\n15 \n \nsame; changes in his ANG pay because of times in transition and times in training; TDY \nexpenses; and \u201cquite a bit of money flowing through [his and his spouse\u2019s] checking \naccount going to contractors and coming in from multiple sources.\u201d  It is simply not credible \nfor Applicant to claim that he failed to recognize the overpayment of some $67,301, \nreceived by him over a brief span of six months, especially where he was found to have \naccessed his LES payment records for each of the pay periods at issue. Of his several \nreasons for the purported oversight, his commercial pilot pay, TDY expense payments, and \ncash flow in and out of his checking account would not be on his LESs, so they could not \nreasonably be sources of overpayments. His ANG pay is reported on his LES, but \nApplicant would have known how many duty hours he worked, and he presented no \ndocumentation showing such variations in his orders and duty pay that could explain \noverpayments exceeding $11,000 a month for six months. Steps taken to monitor his \npersonal finances do not mitigate the concerns for his trustworthiness. Moreover, he has \nyet to pay his $25,000 fine assessed for the court-martial. While DFAS may need a record \nof the fine to accept his payment, he has also not provided DFAS with the documentation \nof the trial record showing the fine. He testified that he did not think about providing that \nrecord, but he failed to show that he has been proactive in addressing that known \nobligation. He presented in evidence one email from August 2017. He testified that he \nwishes he could pay the debt, and that he set aside the funds to pay the debt. However, \nwhen pressed about the source of the funds, he expressed a plan to take the money from \na 401(k) account. As for his Article 133 conduct, Applicant expressed regret for lying to his \nformer employer, but it is somewhat troubling that he cites common practice among pilots \nand a culture that he slid into as factors to explain his lies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(e) applies because of Applicant\u2019s disclosures of his court-marital conviction \non his SF 86, to the OPM investigator, and to several of his colleagues and friends. It is \nunclear to what extent he has disclosed the details to the individuals who strongly endorse \nhim for security clearance eligibility. The two witnesses who testified for Applicant were not \nfully aware of the extent of the overpayments that Applicant wrongfully accepted. At the \nsame time, the concerns of vulnerability are not substantial. For the reasons addressed \nabove, Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are of primary concern, and the \nsecurity concerns in that regard are not sufficiently mitigated, despite the passage of time. \nSerious personal conduct security concerns persist because of his theft of government \nfunds and his dishonest conduct as a civilian employee for the airline. For the reasons \nnoted, adverse findings are returned with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n \nWhole-Person Concept  \n  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d), which are as follows:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \n\n16 \n \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline E, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant\u2019s contributions to the military and now as a \ncivilian contract drone instructor pilot are unassailable and weigh in his favor under the \nwhole-person concept. He has a long history of handling classified information \nappropriately, and he has been careful to advise others that he cannot access classified \ninformation while his security clearance is suspended. His stellar reputation as a pilot and \nnow pilot instructor, and as a person of high integrity and good character, are difficult to \nreconcile with the personal conduct that led to the court-martial. He has offered no \nplausible explanation to overcome the circumstantial evidence of the home remodel, and \nthe thousands of dollars paid out to contractors, as factors in his acceptance of some \n$67,301 in overpayments without notifying the government. Military officers, who are \npresumed to have viewed the evidence objectively and without bias or a personal stake in \nthe outcome, found Applicant culpable of serious misconduct under the UCMJ. \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not intended to punish applicants for specific past \nconduct. The security clearance assessment is a reasonable and careful evaluation of an \napplicant\u2019s circumstances and whether they cast doubt upon his judgment, self-control, and \nother characteristics essential to protecting national security information. In exceptional \ncases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility for a security \nclearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not completely \nmitigated. Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA \nadministrative judges the discretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. See also \nMemorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January \n12, 2018 (\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making \nadjudicative decisions to grant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified \ninformation or to hold a sensitive position . . . Effective immediately, authority to grant \nclearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated in Appendix C is granted to any \nadjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant clearance eligibility \nwhen they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) At the same time, when \nthere is an issue of significant security concern, there is a strong presumption against the \ngrant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990). The Government must be able to rely on those persons granted security \nclearance eligibility to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, regulations, and \npolicies, and without regard to their personal interests. For the reasons discussed, \nApplicant has raised enough doubt in that regard to where I am unable to conclude that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue his eligibility for a security clearance. \n\n17 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She has not addressed her debts in any \nmeaningful way, and she deliberately withheld information about her financial problems \nwhen she submitted her application for a position of trust. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s request \nfor eligibility to occupy a position of trust is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn June 8, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for an ADP I/II/III position for her job \nwith a defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background \ninvestigation, DOD adjudicators were unable to determine, as required by DOD Directive \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \n5220.6 (Directive), that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant\u2019s request for a position of trust.  \n \n \nOn December 21, 2018, DOD issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts raising trustworthiness concerns addressed under the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) for financial considerations (Guideline F) and personal conduct \n(Guideline E). The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June \n8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. I \nreceived the case on April 5, 2019, and scheduled the hearing for May 21, 2019. The \nparties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 \u2013 6. Applicant testified and presented Applicant Exhibit (AX) A. I held the record \nopen after the hearing to receive from Applicant additional relevant information; however, \nshe did not submit anything further and the record closed on May 31, 2019. All exhibits \nproffered at the hearing were admitted without objection. I received a transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on June 17, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $21,266 for 22 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.w). Nine of the debts alleged (SOR 1.b, 1.c, \n1.e, 1.j \u2013 1.m, 1.s and 1.t) are for unpaid medical bills totaling $5,844. In response, \nApplicant admitted the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.f \u2013 1.i, 1.n \u2013 1.r, and 1.v. She denied the \nremaining allegations. As to her medical bills, Applicant denied those allegations on the \nbasis that she has medical insurance that, ostensibly, covered those bills. At the outset \nof the hearing, Department Counsel withdrew the SOR 1.e allegation for lack of \ninformation. (Answer; Tr. 9 \u2013 10) \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleged that Applicant intentionally made false \nstatements in her June 2017 e-QIP when she omitted the debts alleged at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.e \nand 1.g \u2013 1.w (SOR 2.a). It was further alleged that she intentionally made false \nstatements in her June 2017 e-QIP when she omitted the fact that in 1997, she was \ncharged with felony child abuse and misdemeanor contributing to the delinquency of a \nminor, and that she was convicted of misdemeanor child abuse. In response to the SOR, \nApplicant denied both Guideline E allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions to some of the SOR allegations, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and employed by a defense contractor in a position that \nrequires eligibility for a position of trust. Her duties as an administrative assistant at a \nmilitary hospital include safeguarding personally identifiable information (PII) and access \nto sensitive facilities. Applicant has worked for her current employer since January 2016. \nShe has held similar jobs at civilian medical facilities, but this is her first request for \nposition of trust eligibility. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 12, 41) \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant has been married twice, with both marriages ending in divorce. Her first \nmarriage began in May 1999 and ended in September 2003. Her second marriage began \nin April 2014 and ended in July 2018. She has two children, ages 28 and 15. Her younger \nchild lives with her, as do a niece and nephew, both four years old, of whom Applicant \nrecently became guardian. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 40 \u2013 42) \n \n \nApplicant claims that her financial problems arose from her second marriage, \nwhich she described as abusive. She averred that she was left with responsibility for the \nmarital debt because her ex-husband was often unemployed and all of their bills were in \nher name as the sole, reliable income earner. Applicant receives no child support from \nthe father of her 15-year-old child. She receives some financial support from her home \nstate for one of the other two children, but is not yet receiving support for the other child \nbecause that child only recently moved to her home state. (GX 2; Tr. 47, 76 \u2013 78) \n \n \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.a is the remainder due after a car repossession in July \n2014. Applicant financed the purchase of a used car in May 2014. She claimed it was a \nlemon, and that she was about to return the car when it was taken away by the dealer \nafter she missed two payments. Applicant has not taken any action to resolve this debt \nsince late 2014. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 36, 48 \u2013 52) \n \n \nThe debt alleged at SOR 1.n is the result of a dispute with a former landlord. \nApplicant claimed the landlord failed to make needed repairs to the property in which she \nwas living. Because of that dispute, Applicant did not pay the full amount of rent required \nby her lease. The landlord sued her for the difference, and Applicant was present in court \nwhen the landlord was awarded the $1,458 civil judgment against Applicant that is alleged \nin SOR 1.n, and which remains unresolved. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 37, 60 \u2013 62) \n \n \nApplicant testified that the medical debts alleged in the SOR were for emergency \nroom medical services. Those debts arose beginning in 2013, while Applicant was \ngainfully employed. Further, she claimed that she thought those services were covered \nby employer-sponsored medical insurance she carried through her previous employment; \nhowever Applicant was unemployed for the year preceding her current job. Some of the \nsmaller amounts past due are likely for required co-payments. Applicant has not acted to \npay or otherwise resolve any of the debts at SOR 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.j \u2013 1.m, 1.s and 1.t. \n(Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 35 \u2013 36, 52 \u2013 54, 70, 72) \n \n \nApplicant claimed in response to the SOR and at the hearing that she is making \npayments on the debts alleged at SOR 1.f, 1.g, and 1.p, and that she is in contact with \nthe creditor at SOR 1.h to establish a repayment plan for that debt. She did not submit \nany additional information at or after the hearing about the details of her SOR 1.f, 1.g, \nand 1.p arrangements, or that would establish that she has made any payments on any \nof her debts. By contrast, all of the Guideline F SOR allegations are supported by the \nGovernment\u2019s information. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 40 \u2013 41, 54 \u2013 56, 64) \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose any of her debts in response to questions in e-QIP \nSection 26 (Financial Record). In that section, she was asked if, in the preceding seven \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nyears, she (1) had any property repossessed for failure to pay a purchase loan; (2) had \nany civil judgments entered against her to enforce a delinquent debt; (3) had any \ncollection actions presented for delinquent accounts; or (4) was then or had been more \nthan 120 days past-due on any debt. A credit report obtained by government investigators \non June 20, 2017 (12 days after Applicant submitted the e-QIP) reflected all but two of \nthe debts alleged in the SOR under Guideline F. SOR 2.a alleged that Applicant \ndeliberately omitted those debts by answering \u201cno\u201d to all of the Section 26 questions. In \nresponse, Applicant denied intending to make any false statement or to hide anything \nfrom the government. During a subject interview (SI) with a government investigator on \nFebruary 13, 2018, she stated that she did not know she was required to list her debts in \nthe e-QIP. At her hearing, Applicant explained that she was largely unaware of many of \nher medical debts when she completed the e-QIP and that she did not have a credit report \navailable to her for reference at the time she answered those questions. Nonetheless, \nApplicant acknowledged she was present in court when the SOR 1.n civil judgment was \nentered against her. She also was aware that her car was repossessed in 2014 and that \nshe had a remaining obligation on that car loan. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 37 \u2013 40, \n62) \n \n \nIn 1997, Applicant left her oldest child at home with a babysitter so she could go \nto work. At some point, the child went down the street to play with another child. When \nthat child\u2019s father took Applicant\u2019s child home at the end of the day, the babysitter was \ngone. He then took Applicant\u2019s child to the police station believing Applicant had left her \nchild unattended. As alleged in SOR 2.b, Applicant was later issued a citation charging \nher with felony child abuse and misdemeanor contributing to the delinquency of a minor. \nApplicant appeared in court without legal representation and pleaded guilty to \nmisdemeanor child abuse. The other charges were dismissed. She was placed on \nprobation for nine months and made subject to child services supervision of her parenting. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 5; GX 6; Tr. 73 \u2013 75) \n \n \nAlso as alleged in SOR 2.b, Applicant did not disclose her 1997 arrest and guilty \nplea when she answered \u201cno\u201d to questions about felony charges and about offenses \ninvolving \u201ccrimes of violence against a child\u201d in e-QIP Section 22 (Police Record). \nApplicant denies any intent to make a false statement about her arrest or to mislead the \ngovernment by her e-QIP answers. In this instance, she was unrepresented in court and \ndid not know that she had been charged with a felony. She also believed that, because \nthe offense was 20 years old when she submitted her e-QIP, it was beyond the scope of \nthe question. Further, despite the language of the charge against Applicant, the record \ndoes not show that anyone committed an act of violence against her child. (Answer; GX \n1; GX 2; Tr. 39 \u2013 40) \n \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s current finances, available information shows that she is meeting \nall of her current monthly obligations and has not incurred any new delinquencies. \nApplicant files and pays her income taxes as required. Since September 2018, Applicant \nhas been living with a friend after Hurricane Florence made Applicant\u2019s leased residence \nuninhabitable. Applicant pays her friend about $200 monthly, but she expects to pay at \nleast $500 more when her insurance claims are resolved and she can find another place \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nto rent. As noted earlier, Applicant is receiving monetary support for one of the children \nfor whom she is now a guardian. She expects to also receive support for the other child \nlater this year. Applicant estimates she currently has about $400 - $500 remaining each \nmonth after expenses; however, her ability to maintain that positive cash flow will depend \non receipt of additional child support. Applicant receives no child support from the father \nof her 15-year-old child who still lives with her. (GX 2; AX A; Tr. 41 \u2013 47, 64 \u2013 69, 77 \u2013 \n78) \n \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant enlisted the services of a financial advisor for purposes \nof cleaning up her credit report. Applicant found that person on Facebook after speaking \nwith friends at church. She paid the advisor, known only as \u201cCarl,\u201d $300, in exchange for \nwhich she believes he is addressing the debts alleged at SOR 1.i, 1.o and 1.q \u2013 1.r. \nApplicant also claimed that she has nearly completed repaying the debt at SOR 1.p. \nFurther, she submitted a recent credit report which does not list several of the debts in \nthe SOR, but did not provide any information about what became of those debts. Applicant \ndid not present any documentation of what Carl has accomplished, or to support her \nclaims of payments to SOR 1.p. Applicant also did not present any information that shows \nshe manages her money in any systematic way, such as through the use of a budget. \n(AX A; Tr. 55 \u2013 59, 63 \u2013 64, 84 \u2013 86) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix A, Paragraph 1(d) requires \nthat eligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is \n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do so. All such adjudications \nmust adhere to the procedural protections in the Directive before any adverse \ndetermination may be made. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies in the adjudicative \nguidelines. (Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the following \nfactors, commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, listed in the guidelines at \nAG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n \n  \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n \n  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n \n  \n(4) the individual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n \n  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n \n  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \n  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n \n  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n \n  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAdditionally, when applying the adjudicative guidelines (AG), the presence or \nabsence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, conclusive. Nonetheless, \nspecific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured \nagainst them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of eligibility \nfor a position of trust. \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a position of trust for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one is entitled to a position of \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. A person who has access to \nsensitive information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based on \ntrust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring \napplicants possess the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect sensitive information as his or her own. Any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access should be resolved in favor of the Government. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nThe facts established by this record reasonably raise a trustworthiness concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances that is addressed, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18, as follows: \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose largely during her second marriage, which \nended in 2018. Available information shows that most of the debts listed in the SOR have \nbeen past due or delinquent since at least 2013. Applicant\u2019s recent credit report \nnotwithstanding, the record does not establish that any of the debts alleged have been \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \npaid or otherwise resolved. This record requires application of the disqualifying conditions \nat AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). \n \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are recent, because they are unresolved despite \nhaving gone unaddressed, in some cases, since at least 2013. I note Applicant\u2019s claim \nthat most of her current debts resulted from her second marriage and divorce. While \ncircumstances such as those, as well asher more recent relocation due to Hurricane \nFlorence, presented conditions beyond her control, Applicant did not establish that she \nacted responsibly in the face of those challenges. She did not support her claims that she \nhas paid or is paying some of her debts. As to financial counseling, Applicant did not show \nhow or if her retention of \u201cCarl\u201d to assist in her resolution efforts has resulted in any \ntangible benefit or financial improvements. Based on the foregoing, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u2013 20(d) \ndo not apply, and the trustworthiness concerns raised under this guideline are not \nmitigated. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe trustworthiness concern about Applicant\u2019s personal conduct is stated at AG \u00b6 \n15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nMore specifically, the SOR allegations that Applicant deliberately withheld from her \ne-QIP relevant information about her finances and her arrest record reasonably raised \nthe disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(a): \n \ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any \npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s negative responses to the questions at issue were inaccurate. As \nalleged in the SOR, Applicant had multiple debts that required disclosure in e-QIP Section \n26. She also had been charged with criminal offenses that required disclosure in e-QIP \nSection 22. To be disqualifying, her negative responses in both sections must have been \nintentional. Her failure to disclose her felony and misdemeanor child abuse charges was \nnot intentional. Those events occurred 20 years before she completed the e-QIP, and as \na pro se defendant, it is plausible that she did not understand that her initial charge was \na felony that must be reported regardless of how much time has elapsed. SOR 2.b is \nresolved for the Applicant. \n \n \nThe same cannot be said of her failure to disclose her debts. That information is \nrecent and has pervaded her personal circumstances for most of the past decade. \nApplicant knew her vehicle had been repossessed in 2014, as alleged in SOR 1.a, and \nshe was present in court when a civil judgment was entered against her three months \nbefore she submitted her e-QIP. Applicant\u2019s explanation that she did not know she had \nthese and other reportable debts, in light of all of the available information about her \nfinances, is not credible. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. I also have considered the following pertinent \nAG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nThese mitigating conditions do not apply. Applicant made no effort to correct her \nomissions before being confronted with that information during her background \ninvestigation. She also did not present any information showing she asked for guidance \nregarding what information should or should not be provided in response to the Section \n26 questions. Finally, her omissions cannot be considered minor. In her first application \nfor a position of trust with the government, Applicant chose to be deceptive about \ninformation that is directly relevant to the government\u2019s ability to accurately assess \nwhether Applicant can be trusted to put the national interest ahead of her own. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s conduct in this regard was a potential violation of a federal law \n(18 U.S.C. \u00a71001) that prohibits making such false statements to a government agency \nregarding matters within its jurisdiction. Absent substantial information, which Applicant \ndid not provide, to support any of the aforementioned mitigating conditions, the \ntrustworthiness concerns about Applicant\u2019s reliability and judgment raised through SOR \n2.a remain.  \n \n \nI have evaluated the facts and have applied the appropriate adjudicative factors \nunder Guidelines E and F. I also have reviewed the record before me in the context of the \nwhole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s financial problems remain \nunresolved, and Applicant deliberately withheld from her e-QIP information on which the \ngovernment must reasonably rely in deciding whether she can be entrusted with sensitive \ninformation. Applicant did not present any information to support her claims of action \nregarding her debts or to suggest that her current circumstances and false statements do \nnot reflect on her current judgment and reliability. Therefore, doubts about her \ntrustworthiness remain. Because protection of the national interest is the principal focus \nof these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \n \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d, 1.f \u2013 1.w: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nWithdrawn \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to occupy a position of trust.

    "full_text": "       DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\n    DEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nIn the matter of:\n)\n)\n)\n----------------------------------\n)      ISCR Case No. 18-02322\n)\n)\nApplicant for Security Clearance\n)\nAppearances\nFor Government: Jeff Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings and file exhibits, I conclude that Applicant\nmitigated the security concerns regarding his alcohol consumption. Eligibility for access\nto classified information is granted. \nHistory of Case\nOn December 8, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy the DoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for\ngranting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or\nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865 (Exec. Or. 10865),\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\nthe Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines\n(SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/29/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on December 28, 2018, and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019, and scheduled for hearing\non February 14, 2019. A hearing was held on the scheduled date for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance. At the hearing, the\nGovernment\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits (GEs 1-4). Applicant relied on two\nwitnesses (including himself) and no exhibits. The Government\u2019s exhibits were admitted\nwithout objection.  The transcript was received on February 26, 2019.\nProcedural Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to\npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with awards, decorations, and\nendorsements and early release from probation.  For good cause shown, Applicant was\ngranted 45 days to supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded three\ndays to respond. Applicant did not supplement the record.\nSummary of Pleadings\n \nUnder Guidelines  G and J, Applicant allegedly was twice arrested and charged\nwith alcohol-related incidents: once in October 2011 for driving under the influence\n(DUI), and again in March 2016, in which he pled guilty, was fined $1,500, and was\nplaced on probation until May 2019.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the two alcohol-related\nallegations with explanations. He claimed the 2011 DUI arrest and charges were\nreduced to a lesser offense of wet and reckless through plea bargaining because his\nblood-alcohol content (BAC) was less than .08%. He claimed he has abided by all\nrequirements of the court set in connection with both his 2011 and 2016 charges.\nFurther, he claimed he has taken the two alcohol-related incidents very seriously and\nwill never drink again if he intends to drive. And, he claimed he seldom drinks anymore\nunless it is a glass of wine with dinner, and will never drink during any work-related\nactivities.\nFindings of Fact\n Applicant is a 63-year-old program analyst for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\nBackground\n                               \nApplicant was born and raised on a farm in a Midwestern state and his agrarian\nroots have helped to instill in him a strong work ethic. (Tr. 32-33, 40) Applicant married\nin March 1980 and has three children from this marriage. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 30) He earned\nan associate\u2019s degree in May 1980. (GE 1; Tr. 42)  Applicant enlisted in the Marine\nCorps in January 1974 after graduating from high school and served two years of active\n2\n\nduty. (GE 1-2; Tr. 40-41 He received an honorable discharge from the Marine Corps in\nFebruary 1976. (GE 1-2)\nSince March 2018, Applicant has been employed by his current contractor as a\nprogrammer. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 45) He has held a security clearance for over 34 years.\n(GEs 1-2; Tr. 43) Previously, he worked for a defense contractor for over 33 years\nbefore his retirement in March 2017. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 45) During his years of employment\nwith his previous employer, Applicant consistently received outstanding reviews. (Tr.\n37) He enjoys his work and maintains his finances in stable order. (Tr. 38)\nAlcohol-history\nBetween October 2011 and March 2016, Applicant was involved in two alcohol-\nrelated incidents. His most recent incident occurred in March 2016. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 30) In\nMarch 2016, he was arrested by county police after registering a .13 % BAC and\ncharged with DUI. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 55-56) In court, Applicant pled guilty to the charges,\nwas fined $3,500, jailed for four days, and placed on probation until March 2019. (GEs\n1-5; Tr. 50-51, 55-56) Additionally, the court directed him to enroll in an 18-month\nalcohol substance abuse program (ASAP) and complete the program. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 52-\n53) Applicant is credited with successfully completing the program. Applicant\u2019s\nprobation expired in March 2019 without any raised issues.\nIn October 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI after returning\nfrom a dinner party. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 30-33). Despite registering .08% in an administered\nBreathalyzer, the court reduced the charges to a wet and reckless offense, fined him\n$1,500, and placed him on probation for 36 months. (GEs 1-4; Tr. 54) Applicant\ncompleted his probation without reported incidents.\nSince his 2016 DUI incident, Applicant seldom drinks and never drinks when he\nis planning to drive. (GE 2; Tr. 31) Applicant\u2019s claims of light drinking are corroborated\nby his wife. (Tr. 32-35)\nPolicies\nThe AGs list guidelines to be used administrative judges in the decision-making\nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could\ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as\nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a\nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (disqualifying conditions), if any, and many\nof the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\u201d  \nThe AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is\nto be evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with AG \u00b6 2(c) \n3\n\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in AG \u00b6 2(d)\nof the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine\na sufficient period of an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made\nabout whether the applicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be\nconsidered together with the following AG \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and\nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\n              Alcohol consumption \nThe Concern: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the\nexercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\n        Criminal Conduct\nThe Concern: criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and\nregulations.\n       Burden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant\nor continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold\nfinding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the\nDirective requires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's\neligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and\nmateriality of that evidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511\n(1995).  As with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\n4\n\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or\nmaintain a security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, the judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security\nclearances be clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the\nultimate burden of demonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the\nNavy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nApplicant incurred two alcohol-related incidents between 2011 and 2016.\nPrincipal security issues raised in this case center on Applicant\u2019s two alcohol-related\noffenses covered by Guideline G and incorporated under Guideline J.\nAlcohol consumption concerns\nApplicant\u2019s two alcohol-related incidents over a five-year period (2011-2016\nraise concerns over his risk of future alcohol abuse. On the strength of the evidence\npresented, two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for alcohol consumption (AG\n\u00b6 21) may be applied: DC \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such\nas driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s\nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol abuse\ndisorder,\u201d and 22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use\ndisorder.\u201d\nBased on the court findings relative to Applicant\u2019s 2011 and 2016 alcohol-related\nincidents and his proactive efforts since his March 2016 offense, he may take full\nadvantage of the following Guideline G mitigating conditions: MC \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \u201cso much\ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment,\u201d and 32(d) \u201cthe individual has\nsuccessfully completed a treatment program along with required aftercare, and has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s circumstances and subsequent actions following his last alcohol-\nrelated incident in March 2016 are sufficient to facilitate safe predictions that he will\navoid any abusive drinking in the foreseeable future. Besides his own commitments to\n5\n\nmaintaining responsible drinking in the future, he benefits from a strong family network\nof  support.  His wife has been very vocal about her own efforts to reinforce Applicant\u2019s \nexpressed commitments to avoid drinking when he thinks he will be driving.\nCriminal conduct concerns\nSecurity concerns are also raised with respect to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related\nincidents under the overlapping coverage of Guideline J. Disqualifying conditions\napplicable to Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses under Guideline J (criminal conduct)\nare twofold: DC \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), \u201ca pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own\nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in\ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness,\u201d and\n31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and\nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was\nformally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d Each of these two cited DUI offenses are\ncross-referenced under Guideline G and are considered to be alcohol-related for\npurposes of Guideline J analysis.  \nApplicable mitigating conditions covering Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related offenses\nunder Guideline J are as follows:  MC \u00b6\u00b6 32(a), \u201c\u201dso much time has elapsed since the\ncriminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, restitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job\ntraining or higher education, good employment record, or constructive community\ninvolvement.\u201d  Passage of time since Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related offense in March\n2016 exceeds two years and provides enough time to mitigate these alcohol-related\noffenses under Guideline J as well.\nWhole-person assessment\nApplicant\u2019s lengthy 35-year career of civilian service with DoD contractors,\nfollowing his honorable service with the Marine Corps, is much appreciated and\nrespected. His excellent performance reviews from his prior employer of 33 years\nprovide strong reinforcement of his claims of dedicated service with this prior employer.\nConsidering the record as a whole, safe predictions can be made at this time about\nApplicant\u2019s ability to avoid alcohol-related incidents in the foreseeable future. Alcohol\nconcerns are fully mitigated and enable favorable conclusions to be made in connection\nwith the allegations covered by Guidelines G and J.\n                                               Formal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n6\n\nGUIDELINE G (ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION):   FOR APPLICANT\n           \nSubparagraphs 1.a -1.b:\n                     For Applicant\nGUIDELINE J (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):            FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSubparagraph 2.a :                                For Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nClearance is granted. \n                                          \nRoger C.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n06/26/2019 \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 26, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on May 6, 2019. \nThe Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. Applicant was afforded an \n\n \n2 \n \n \nopportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation \nwithin 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant provided a statement to the FORM that \nis marked as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A. There were no objections to any of the \nGovernment or Applicant\u2019s evidence and Items 1 through 6 and AE A were admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on June 24, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the sole SOR allegation. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 64 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1977 and two master\u2019s \ndegrees in 1982 and 1986. He married in 1998 and has two children ages 19 and 17 \nyears old. Applicant has been employed since August 2016 by a federal contractor. (Item \n2) \n \n \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in January 2017. In it \nhe disclosed the delinquent credit card debt alleged in the SOR (\u00b6 1.a.-$26,019). He \nstated the reason for his failure to pay the debt was because he was out of work. In \nresponse to the inquiry to provide the current status of the financial issue, he stated: \u201cI \nam planning to file for bankruptcy when the time is right.\u201d (Item 1) \n \n \nIn November 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ntold the investigator that his finances were \u201cokay\u201d and he could pay his current bills on \ntime, but could not afford to pay down his past debt. He acknowledged he owed \napproximately $26,000 for a credit card bill that was in collection status. He explained that \nin 2008, he was laid off and used the credit card to make up for his lack of pay and to \npurchase general household items. He stopped making payments on the bill in February \n2014. He told the investigator that he could not afford to pay this debt and did not \nanticipate being able to pay the debt down or being able to pay it anytime soon. He further \nstated he intended to file bankruptcy no later than the summer of 2018 unless his finances \nimproved.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges one credit card debt with an outstanding balance of $26,019 that \nwas placed in collection status in March 2014. A credit report from April 2017 lists the \ndebt as in collection. Credit reports from September 2018 and April 2019 list the debt as \ncharged off. (Items 1, 4, 5, 6) \n \n \nIn Appellant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the allegation and stated the \nfollowing: \u201cWhile I had an outstanding balance with [creditor] for the amount noted, at the \ntime when I first applied for a clearance, I am now making payments on the balance and \nintend to pay this off.\u201d He did not provide documentary proof. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant explained in his FORM response that he began experiencing financial \nproblems in 2007 when he was laid off after twenty years of employment with a large \ndefense contractor. He was unemployed as follows: July 2007 to May 2008; October 2008 \n\n \n3 \n \n \nto December 2010; August 2012 to August 2013; and January 2014 to October 2014. \nDuring the interim periods Applicant was underemployed in part-time work or worked for \nemployers as he was needed. At different times his only source of income was \nunemployment insurance. In 2010, he chose to move his family to a more affordable \nlocation. He placed their townhouse for sale, but it did not sell until September 2012. He \nwas forced to continue to pay the mortgage and rent on the apartment where his family \nhad moved. (AE A) \n \nApplicant also attributed his financial problems to medical expenses in December \n2016, November 2017, and February 2018 for his wife that were not covered by \ninsurance. He said that he is making payments on these debts. He also had medical bills \nnot covered by insurance that he had to pay. He did not provide what he paid, when he \npaid them, and any remaining balance. (AE A) \n \n \nApplicant stated in his FORM responses that he contacted the credit card company \nin early 2019. He said he began repaying the debt in March 2019 and reduced the amount \nowed to $24,770. Applicant failed to provide documentary proof that he has a payment \nplan with the creditor or proof that he has reduced his debt. (AE A) \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a large delinquent credit card debt that was in collection and charged \noff in 2014. He indicated when completing his SCA and during his background interview \nthat he did not intend to pay it because he did not have the resources and he intended to \nfile bankruptcy. He had long periods of unemployment and underemployment and \nmedical debts and was unable to pay the debt. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide evidence that he is paying the large credit card debt \nalleged. He repeatedly stated he did not intend to pay it because he did not have the \nresources, but then said he is paying it, but provided no proof. His delinquent debt is \nrecent and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment, underemployment, \nand medical debts. These were conditions beyond his control. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly. Applicant has been employed since \nAugust 2016. He indicated he had medical bills not covered by insurance, but failed to \nprovide evidence of a payment plan and payments on the large credit card debt. Based \non his representations, it is unclear when he began to take action to resolve the debt as \nhe had previously stated he that he likely was going to file bankruptcy. It is unknown if he \nhas negotiated a payment plan with the creditor, the term of the plan, and what payments \nhe has made. AG \u00b6 20(b) has partial application.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence Applicant has received financial counseling. Applicant failed \nto provide substantiating evidence that he is making good-faith efforts to pay the debt \nalleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is 64 years old and is highly educated. He has had long periods of \nunemployment and underemployment that impacted his finances. It is unknown if his wife \nwas employed during this time. His other financial obligations are unknown. The large \ncredit card debt alleged has been delinquent since 2014. Applicant stated that sometime \nin 2019 he began to address the debt, but failed to corroborate his actions. He initially \nstated in reference to this debt that he intended to file bankruptcy. There is no evidence \nthat Applicant has negotiated a settlement or has established a track record of consistent \npayments towards this significant debt. Applicant has not met his burden of persuasion. \nThe record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking access to classified information for his job with a federal contractor. He works as a fuel dispatcher for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since June 2017. His employment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force from November 2005 to November 2015. He has had full-time employment since his discharge from military service. He is married, and he and his spouse have three minor children. The SOR alleges and Applicant admits a history of financial problems consisting of 15 delinquent accounts, in collection, charged off, or past due, in amounts ranging from $39 to $11,455 for a total of about $25,210. The indebtedness includes three medical collection accounts for a total of about $277, and a past-due child-support account in the amount of $5,355. In addition to his admissions, the delinquent accounts are established by credit reports from 2017, 2018, and 2019. (Exhibits 7, 6, and 5, respectively) Applicant did not present documentation to establish that any of those accounts were paid, settled, in a payment arrangement, in dispute, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. The most recent credit report from June 2019, which was submitted by Department Counsel, shows Applicant has made payments on the $11,455 charged- off account in SOR \u00b6 1.a; the charged-off amount was $8,200; and the past-due balance is now $6,156.

The evidence is not sufficient to mitigate his history of \nfinancial problems. He has not made a good-faith effort to resolve more than $20,000 in \ndelinquent debt. He also made deliberately false statements on a 2017 security \nclearance application when he denied having any delinquent debts. Accordingly, this \ncase is decided against Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non June 28, 2017. (Exhibit 3) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on November 14, 2018, after reviewing the \napplication and the information gathered during a background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent \nApplicant a statement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n\n \n2 \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guidelines known as Guideline F for financial considerations \nand Guideline E for personal conduct (falsification). \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 20, 2019. He provided handwritten \nresponses on the SOR in which he admitted all the allegations. He did not submit any \nsupporting documentation with his answer to the SOR. When he answered the SOR, he \nwas then working in support of the U.S. Armed Forces in Afghanistan. He requested a \ndecision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge.  \n \nOn June 6, 2019, Department Counsel submitted all relevant and material \ninformation that could be adduced at a hearing. The file of relevant material (FORM) \nconsists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting documentation, some of \nwhich are identified as evidentiary exhibits. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who \nreceived it on June 20, 2019. When he received the FORM, he listed a current home or \nmailing address in the Continental United States. He did not reply within 30 days of \nreceipt of the FORM. The case was assigned to me on August 21, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking access to classified \ninformation for his job with a federal contractor. He works as a fuel dispatcher for a \ncompany in the defense industry. He has been so employed since June 2017. His \nemployment history includes honorable service in the U.S. Air Force from November \n2005 to November 2015. He has had full-time employment since his discharge from \nmilitary service. He is married, and he and his spouse have three minor children.  \n \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits a history of financial problems consisting \nof 15 delinquent accounts, in collection, charged off, or past due, in amounts ranging \nfrom $39 to $11,455 for a total of about $25,210. The indebtedness includes three \nmedical collection accounts for a total of about $277, and a past-due child-support \naccount in the amount of $5,355. In addition to his admissions, the delinquent accounts \nare established by credit reports from 2017, 2018, and 2019. (Exhibits 7, 6, and 5, \nrespectively)  \n \nApplicant did not present documentation to establish that any of those accounts \nwere paid, settled, in a payment arrangement, in dispute, cancelled, forgiven, or \notherwise resolved. The most recent credit report from June 2019, which was submitted \nby Department Counsel, shows Applicant has made payments on the $11,455 charged-\noff account in SOR \u00b6 1.a; the charged-off amount was $8,200; and the past-due \nbalance is now $6,156. (Exhibit 5 at 2) Likewise, he paid the $852 collection account in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e, and the account is described as a paid collection. (Exhibit 5 at 2) Six of the \nseven accounts in the June 2019 credit report are delinquent. At this point, 14 of the 15 \ndelinquent accounts in the SOR are unresolved.   \n \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent accounts or other financial problems in \nresponse to the questions in Section 26 of the security clearance application. (Exhibit 3) \n\n \n3 \n \nIn particular, he did not disclose or otherwise reveal any adverse financial information in \nresponse to eight different questions under the subject of \u201cdelinquency involving routine \naccounts.\u201d He answered in the negative to those eight questions. He was confronted \nabout numerous delinquent accounts during a May 2018 interview conducted as part of \nhis background investigation. (Exhibit 4) In neither his answer to the SOR nor in reply to \nthe FORM, Applicant did not provide an explanation for omitting his delinquent financial \naccounts on his security clearance application.  \n \nApplicant did not present any information about his employment record, current \nor in the past. He did not present any information about his performance of duty while in \nthe U.S. Air Force. Nor did he present any favorable letters of recommendation or \nsupport.  \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n\n \n4 \n \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, I note as a starting point that Applicant has \nhad full-time employment for many years, dating back to his time in military service. \nNevertheless, his financial problems are largely unresolved and ongoing, he has \n                                                          \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n\n \n5 \n \nnumerous delinquent accounts, and his indebtedness did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances (e.g., loss of employment, unexpected medical emergency, divorce, \netc.). Accordingly, the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor.   \n \n \nApplicant has not made \u201ca good-faith effort\u201d to resolve the vast majority of the \nindebtedness reflected in the SOR. He receives some credit for resolving the $852 \ncollection account and reducing the past-due balance on a rather large charged-off \naccount. Otherwise, he has made little to no progress. Moreover, aside from Exhibit 5 \noffered by Department Counsel, what is missing here is documentation in support of his \ncase. For example, there is no documentation to establish that he initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve the remaining delinquent \naccounts. Likewise, there is no documentation showing that he has the financial \nwherewithal or an overall plan to resolve his delinquent accounts. Accordingly, the \nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \n \nUnder Guideline E, personal conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about a person\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. The concern is stated fully in AG \u00b6 15. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, the following disqualifying condition applies:  \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \n \n \nAs set forth in the findings of fact, Applicant made deliberately false statements \nwhen he omitted his numerous delinquent financial accounts in response to multiple \nquestions on his June 2017 security clearance application. He has not provided an \nexplanation for his omissions. I have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17, and none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. Making deliberately false statements during the \nsecurity clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away, \nexcused, or otherwise mitigated. Based on the record, Applicant\u2019s misconduct in \nfalsifying his 2017 security clearance application is too serious to be mitigated.   \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I gave particular \nconsideration to his honorable military service. I conclude that he has not met his \nultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a -- 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.

The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on June 12, 2019, scheduling the \nhearing for August 22, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n\n \n2 \n \n \nI marked the Government\u2019s discovery letter and its exhibit list as Hearing Exhibits \n(HE) I and II.

He is 48 years old. He married in 2005 and has two children as a result of \nthat marriage. He has a third child who is a young adult from a former relationship. He \nhas two young children with his current wife. Applicant completed his latest security \nclearance application in June 2017. He obtained a security clearance in 2007. (GE 1)  \nApplicant obtained his undergraduate degree in 2002 and his master\u2019s degree in 2011. \nHe has worked for his current employer as a network engineer since June 2016. (Tr. \n103) \n \n \nFinancial \n \n \nThe SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.m alleged failure to timely file state and Federal income tax \nreturns from 2012 through 2016; delinquent federal tax debt in the amount of $50,343 \nfor tax years 2012 through 2015; state delinquent tax debt in the amount of $60,896 for \ntax years 2010 through 2014; five judgments; and four collection accounts for an \napproximate total of $50,000. Applicant admitted that his financial record looks bad, but \nthat does not reflect who he is as a person.  \n \n \nApplicant explained that in 2007, he was financially stable, and had a good \nincome. His one daughter lived with her mother. He attributes the debts to purchasing \nfive properties between the years of 2007 and 2008. He revealed that he had extra \nmoney and wanted to explore the real estate market. He purchased the first property \nand rented the home until 2009. (Tr. 41) Applicant purchased a second property and \nhad a tenant who paid the rent. Applicant purchased that house with his mother-in-law. \n(Tr. 42) He also purchased a property in 2007 with his sister. In 2008, Applicant \npurchased yet another house and was able to rent it. He explained that he had sufficient \nincome from the rentals to pay the five mortgages. (Tr. 44)  Applicant bought another \nhouse at an auction in 2008. (AX A) He purchased the last property with his wife in \n2008. (Tr. 47)  The total purchase price for the five properties (2007-2008) was about \n$675,000. (Tr. 104) At that time, Applicant earned about $95,000 a year. (Tr. 105) \n \n \nApplicant attributed the market crisis in 2010 and 2011 for his financial problems. \nThe tenants could not afford to buy the houses and the value of the properties declined. \nHe also explained that one of the properties in another state was rented for lower \nincome section 8 housing and tenants would put down a deposit and not pay the rent, \nbut stay in the house. (Tr. 50) When houses in that area became vacant, there was \nvandalism. He tried to fix the houses but the agent-broker stated that they could not be \n\n \n3 \n \nrented or listed. Applicant attempted to sell the houses but was not successful. The \nhomes went to foreclosure. (Tr. 106) Applicant began using his credit cards to remodel \nthe various properties. Applicant had five mortgages to pay and no tenants paying rent. \nHe became overwhelmed. (Tr.52) He managed to sell one house at a loss and another \nat cost. (Tr. 52)  \n \n \nAt the same time, Applicant explained he became involved in a 2010 custody \ndispute involving his daughter from a former relationship. (AX B) The mother of the \ndaughter went to court to ask for more child support and he was ordered to pay about \n$700 a month. The child support increased to $963 in year 2010-2011. (Tr. 55) \nApplicant became delinquent in the child support and he incurred large legal fees from \ncourt proceedings. He also paid $150 in arrears, which made for a total monthly \npayment of $1,000 in year 2014. This amount was automatically deducted from his \npaycheck. (Tr. 56) Applicant completed his child support obligations in 2016. (Tr. 57, GX \n4) \n \n \nApplicant further explained that his sister with whom he had purchased two \nproperties had a stroke in 2009. She lost her employment, and Applicant was now \nresponsible for the entire mortgage on the properties. Applicant also was diagnosed \nwith diabetes and he incurred medical expenses. (Tr. 61) \n \n \nApplicant does not want to file for bankruptcy. He was emphatic that he is not \nirresponsible and did not live beyond his means. Until about 2010, he was financially \nstable. He thought he was making good investments and did not want to give up. Also, \nhe had no idea that the market would fall or that his sister would have a stroke. He \nknows he made mistakes and he has learned from them. He explained that he would \nnot venture into the real estate market again. His plan was to resolve one financial issue \nat a time. When the child support ended in 2016, he paid some non-SOR debts. (Tr. 63) \nApplicant summed up by saying that another catastrophe occurred when his home roof \nleaked in 2011, causing him to lose important documents, including tax materials. He \nstated that stopped him from preparing his taxes because he was overwhelmed and did \nnot have the information needed to prove his losses.  (Tr. 65) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.a, and 1.b, Applicant admitted that he had not filed Federal (2012 \nthrough 2016) and state income tax returns (2013 through 2016) in a timely manner.  At \nthis time, Applicant has filed all his income tax returns according to tax transcripts in \n2017 for the years 2012 through 2016. (GX 4)  The forms were completed by a tax \nprofessional.  When he filed the income tax returns, he included the 1099 forms for the \nmortgage deficiencies. His reason for the delay in filing was that he was totally \noverwhelmed with his financial situation. (Tr. 120) In 2017, Applicant obtained the \nservices of a community tax group to help him resolve remaining tax issues for tax year \n2017. (AX D)  Applicant still does not have a payment plan in place with the IRS. (Tr. \n125) He noted that he has not been happy with the work that the community tax \nprogram has partially completed on his behalf. \n \n \nSOR 1.c is the amount of delinquent federal taxes for years 2012, 2013, 2014, \nand 2015. The total taxes due is $50,343. Applicant began making payments of varying \n\n \n4 \n \namounts to the IRS beginning in 2018. (AX C) He also returned a refund from tax years \n2016, 2017, and 2018. (Tr. 67) He believes that he has paid about $30,000 to the IRS. \n(Tr. 81) The payments are not consistent due to lack of money. Due to penalties and \ninterest, he still owes about $60,000. (Tr. 128) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.d, Applicant admits that he is indebted for delinquent state taxes for \napproximately $60,896 for tax years 2010 through 2014. He submitted a letter from the \nstate comptroller, dated September 17, 2018, indicating that Applicant agreed to \nestablish a payment plan. The agreement called for a down payment of $700 on May 8, \n2018, and monthly payments of $450 until the balance is paid in full. (AX E) He did not \nfurnish any proof, but he stated that he has been making the monthly payments to the \nstate. (Tr. 130) \n \n \nSOR 1.e is a 2011 judgment in the amount of $24,971. This is related to a credit \ncard debt. Applicant has not engaged in any payments or plans until he has the tax \nsituation under control. (Tr. 84) \n  \n \nSOR 1.f is a 2012 judgment in the amount of $10,929.  He stated at the hearing \nthat he has not made any payments to date. (Tr.131) \n \n \nSOR 1.g is a 2012 judgment for a homeowner\u2019s association (HOA) fee in the \napproximate amount of $1,675. Applicant presented documentation that all \nassessments owed to the HOA included in the lien filed against the home unit have \nbeen paid in full. (AX C)  \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.h, this is a 2014 judgment in the amount of $1,735 for an HOA fee \non Applicant\u2019s residence. (GX 6) He stated that he moved from the house in 2012. He \ncannot find proof that it was paid even though his wife used a money order. He noted \nthat his wife drove to the lawyer\u2019s office to pay it. He noted that the house has been \nsold. (Tr. 90)  \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.i, this is a 2014 judgment in the amount of $4,661. Applicant is not \ncertain if he paid or settled this account. There appeared to be a similar account listed in \n1.l for $1,021 held by the same bank. He believes he settled the debt in 1.l, but he could \nnot be certain. \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.j, a phone collection account in the amount of $1,267, Applicant \npresented a statement that shows a payment of $418.22 that was made on November \n2017. (AX C) He claims that the debt was settled for that amount. (Tr. 91) Applicant paid \nthis with a credit card. (Tr.135) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.k, a collection account in the amount of $5,178. Applicant admitted \nthat he has not paid this debt. (Tr. 91) He stated that it was charged off by the company. \n \n \nSOR 1.m is a medical debt in collection for $165. Applicant explained that it was \ninitially a problem with the insurance and he disputed it, but later paid the debt. He \nbelieves it was a long time ago and he has no proof of payment. (Tr. 93) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant earns approximately $107,000 yearly and his wife works part time as a \nnurse. She earns about $18,000 a year. He had a 401(k), but cashed out a portion to \npay for some taxes. Applicant believes that he has about $7,000 in the account. He has \na small savings account. He believes that his monthly net remainder is about $100.  In \n2018, he visited his family abroad. (Tr. 115) In 2019, he went again to visit a sick family \nmember. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s employer testified that he has known applicant since 2003. At one \npoint in time, he was Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor. The employer stated that Applicant is \nan outstanding employee. He is professional and produces outstanding results. \nApplicant\u2019s employer was not aware of the breadth of the current financial security \nconcerns. (Tr. 15) Applicant is considered to be a valuable employee. (Tr. 17) His \nemployer interacts with Applicant on a daily basis. (Tr. 24) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister, who had a stroke several years ago, testified at the hearing. \nShe had difficulty speaking, but she confirmed that she co-signed with Applicant on the \npurchase of two of the properties in 2008. (Tr. 142) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his testimony and his credit reports \nestablish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d), 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) and 19(f) (\u201cfailure \nto file of fraudulently file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d) \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20 (g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \n \nApplicant admitted and his credit reports confirm that he has been indebted to \nthe Federal and state government for income taxes for an approximate total of \n$111,000. He failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns from 2012 \nthrough 2016. In 2017, he filed the required income tax returns. His reasoning for not \nfiling was being overwhelmed by his financial issues that began in 2010. This \nexplanation is not acceptable. AG 20(a) is not fully applicable because he does not \nhave his finances under control. \n \nHe bought five properties in 2007-2008. When the real estate market crashed, \nhis financial problems began. His tenants could not pay rent and he could not cover the \nalmost $650,000 in mortgages for more than a few months. His sister, who had co-\nsigned a note with him, had a stroke in 2009 and she could no longer work. He lost her \nfinancial help. He was dealing with child support issues and he was diagnosed with \ndiabetes. These were all beyond his control. To his credit, the child support obligations \nare no longer a concern. AG 20(b) partially applies, but he did not act responsibly under \nthe circumstances. \n \n He incurred other delinquent debts by using credit cards to pay expenses. He \nrecently filed his Federal and state income tax returns but still owes a significant sum of \nmoney in taxes. He began making some payments for the federal debt in late 2018, but \nhe still does not have a payment plan in place. In 2018, he agreed to a settlement for \nthe state income taxes, and has started payments. He has paid one or two small debts \nand he intends to pay all his delinquent debts. He does not want to file for bankruptcy. \n\n \n8 \n \nHe had no documentation for some of the accounts he stated that he had paid due to a \nflood in his house caused by a leaking roof, resulting in lost documents. Applicant has \nbeen steadily employed. He experienced financial problems due to circumstances \nbeyond his control, but he did not establish that he acted responsibly in the wake of \nthose unforeseen circumstances. Applicant\u2019s inaction regarding his taxes and his other \ndebts precludes a conclusion that his finances are mitigated. He did not receive credit \ncounseling. AG 20 (c) does not apply. He submitted some receipts for payments or \nsettlement of some debts. Applicant submitted an agreement with the state, dated \nSeptember 28, 2018, to pay taxes. Due to the lack of evidence submitted by Applicant, \nit is impossible to conclude he made sufficient good-faith effort to resolve his debts  or \nthat his financial situation is under control. AG 20 (g) partially applies in this case. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified at the hearing. He goes to work each day and \nsupports his family. Applicant has a good reputation in the workplace.  He knows he has \nmade mistakes in the past, and will not enter the real estate market again. He has \nlearned from his mistakes. He was passionate about the fact that he wanted to achieve \na lot for his family. He was challenged with child support issues, but he did not shirk \nfrom them. However, his judgment with respect to the filing and paying taxes provides \ndoubts despite his intention and commitment to pay all his delinquent debts. He has \npaid smaller debts. He is steadfast that he wants to pay his debts and not file for \nbankruptcy. On balance, Applicant did not produce information sufficient to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns about his finances.  \n \n\n \n9 \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with some questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance at this time. Because protection of the \ninterests of national security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining \ndoubts must be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 29, 2016. On \nNovember 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines F and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 17, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

On February 28, \n2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for March 26, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified, presented the testimony of two other witnesses, and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through I, which were admitted without objection. I kept the \nrecord open until April 19, 2019, to enable him to submit additional documentary \nevidence. He timely submitted AX J through T, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 5, 2019. \nFindings of Fact1 \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \n1.h, and 2.a. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Department Counsel withdrew SOR \n\u00b6 1.g. Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor, involved in the test \nand evaluation of training systems. He married in July 2006. He and his wife have two \nchildren, ages 12 and 3. He has worked for his current employer since March 2016. He \nserved on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 2004 to May 2014 and received \nan honorable discharge. He spent six years on sea duty as a tactical air controller and \nfour years as a tactical air control instructor. (Tr. 35.) He first received a security \nclearance in June 2004. \nApplicant left the Navy to care for his elderly and disabled mother, who had lived \nalone since Applicant\u2019s father passed away in 2005. He intended to stay in the Navy but \nwas unable to obtain an assignment near his mother. He thought he had a job with a \ndefense contractor waiting for him after his discharge, but he was mistaken. He planned \nto attend college, but did not realize that the GI Bill pays a housing allowance only for \nthe time actually spent in school. He realized in hindsight that he had not planned well \nfor the financial challenges of leaving the Navy. (Tr. 35-36.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in October 2017. In December 2018, Applicant \nwas appointed the administrator of his mother\u2019s estate. He had anticipated inheriting his \nmother\u2019s investments in certificates of deposit totaling more than $100,000. After his \nmother\u2019s death, he discovered that his sister was the sole beneficiary for the certificates \nof deposit. (Tr. 41; AX I.) However, he inherited his mother\u2019s home, two other parcels of \nland, and three vehicles. (Tr. 47.) \nApplicant was unemployed after his discharge until March 2015. He was bitten \nby a kitten that he had adopted in early 2015. The bite wound became infected, and he \ncontracted Bell\u2019s palsy (temporary facial paralysis), which lasted about eight weeks. His \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwife became pregnant in February 2015. Between March 2015 and obtaining his current \nemployment, he had no medical insurance. He began classes at a community college, \nbut dropped out during his second semester due to the Ball\u2019s palsy. He incurred an \nindebtedness to the Department of Veteran\u2019s Affairs for failing to complete the \nsemester, which was collected by garnishment of his pay. (Tr. 43-44.) \nApplicant was fired from two jobs for customer-service issues in vehicle repair \nshops in August 2015 and January 2016. He was unemployed for one month in 2016 \nand worked for one month in a tire store until he began his current job. In March 2017, \nhe incurred about $6,000 in veterinary fees when the family dog became ill and \neventually died. (GX 5 at 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment, underemployment, and unexpected medical and \nveterinary expenses caused him to fall behind on his debt payments, resulting in the \ndebts alleged in the SOR, which are reflected in his credit reports from January 2018 \n(GX 2), February 2018 (GX 3), and November 2018 (GX 4). The evidence concerning \nthese debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card account charged off for $13,511. At the time of the \nhearing, he believed that he had arrived at a settlement with the creditor, but he had no \ndocumentation and did not know the specific terms of the settlement. (Tr. 46.) On April \n10, 2019, about two weeks after the hearing, Applicant agreed in writing to pay this debt \nin full by May 31, 2019. (AX R.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: deficiency of $10,653 after repossession of vehicle. Applicant \nbought a car about a week after he was hired by his current employer, and he incurred \na high interest rate because of his poor credit record. (Tr. 38.) He borrowed about \n$30,000 to purchase the car. (Tr. 47.) He testified that he bought an expensive car \nbecause he had a long commute to work, and he wanted a car that was comfortable \nand enjoyable. He admitted that, in hindsight, it was a \u201creally bad idea.\u201d (Tr. 61-62.) He \nsurrendered the car when he could not make the payments. He has a payment  \nagreement for this debt, and he made a $25 payment in November 2018 and $100 \npayments in December 2018, January 2019, February 2019, and March 2019. (AX A.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $9,754. Applicant received a \nsettlement offer for this debt in February 2018. (AX B.) He accepted the offer in April \n2019 and agreed to pay a lump-sum of $1,950 by May 31, 2019. (AX Q.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: delinquent automobile loan charged off for $7,943. This vehicle \nhas not been repossessed, and Applicant continues to drive it. (Tr. 50.) In December \n2018, Applicant received an offer to settle this debt for $1,985. (AX C.) He accepted the \noffer in April 2019 and agreed to pay the amount due by May 31, 2019. (AX S.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: credit-card account placed for collection of $758. Applicant paid \nthis debt in February 2011. (AX D.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: withdrawn. (Tr. 66-67.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: delinquent federal taxes of $3,000. Applicant\u2019s 2015 federal \nincome tax return was audited and he was notified by the IRS that he owed additional \ntaxes. He had not paid them as of the date of his interview with a security investigator in \nJune 2018. (GX 5 at 5.) The debt was paid by involuntary application of his tax refund \nwhen he filed his federal income tax return for 2017. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: failure to file federal income taxes returns for 2017. Applicant told \na security investigator that he failed to timely file his federal income tax return for 2017 \ndue to procrastination and misplacing documentation regarding mortgage interest on \nthe family home. He had not yet filed the past-due return when he was interviewed by \nthe security investigator in June 2018. (GX 5 at 5.) He filed the return in September \n2018, and his $3,121 refund was applied to the tax debt from 2015. (AX E; AX F; AX G.) \nApplicant has not sought or received financial counseling since his financial \nproblems began. (Tr. 57.) His take-home pay is about $4,000 per month. (Tr. 58.) His \nwife\u2019s take-home pay is about $1,600 per month. (Tr. 61.) He and his wife now live in \nthe home he inherited from his mother. (Tr. 46-47.) Because the inherited home \nrequires numerous repairs, they have no net monthly remainder. (Tr. 64.) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly payment on his previous home is $1,600 per month, and the \nbalance due on the loan is about $212,000. He has listed his previous home for sale for \n$274,990. (AX M.) On the advice of his realtor, he has made repairs to the home \ncosting about $2,141, and his realtor is confident that it will sell quickly. (AX N through \nO.) He is also making the mortgage-loan payments on his mother\u2019s home, where he \nnow lives, which are $860 per month for the first mortgage and $400 on an equity line of \ncredit. (Tr. 60.) Applicant is counting on the sale of his previous home to pay off the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. (Tr. 51.)  \nFrom January to September, 2017, Applicant improperly used his employer\u2019s \ncredit card to buy fuel for his car, because he could not afford to buy fuel for his \ncommute to and from work. He admitted that he knew the terms under which he was \ngiven a company credit card did not permit him to use it for personal expenses. (Tr. 56.) \nHe testified that he was afraid to tell anyone in the company that he was having \nfinancial issues. (Tr. 57.) His misuse of the credit card was discovered when he missed \na payment and the credit-card issuer reported the late payment to his employer. (GX 5 \nat 4.) His program manager reprimanded him for misuse of the credit card. Applicant \nsigned an agreement that he would be terminated if he misused a company credit card \nagain. (Tr. 56.) \nThe same program manager who reprimanded Applicant submitted a letter \nstating that his work has been superior, and he recommended that Applicant be given \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanother chance. (AX J.) Applicant\u2019s facility security manager also noted Applicant\u2019s \nchanged behavior and his \u201cunyielding attempt to rebuild trust with the organization.\u201d (AX \nK.) \nThe team lead for the contract on which Applicant is working testified that \nApplicant\u2019s Navy experience has made him the \u201cgo-to guy\u201d on their current contract. (Tr. \n24-25.) A co-worker has known Applicant for two years, and they have become friends. \nThe co-worker testified that Applicant has truthfully disclosed his financial problems and \nhas demonstrated that he is trustworthy. (Tr. 29-30.) Both witnesses knew that \nApplicant has financial problems but were not familiar with the details. (Tr. 26, 31.) \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR  Case No. 15\u00ad\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. Affluence that cannot be \nexplained by known sources of income is also a security concern insofar \nas it may result from criminal activity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \nAG \u00b6 19(d): deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate \ntax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with \nthose arrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s unemployment from May 2014 to \nMarch 2015, his affliction with Ball\u2019s palsy, and his unexpected and uninsured medical \nand veterinary expenses were conditions largely beyond his control. The evidence is \nsparse regarding the circumstances under which he was fired in August 2015 and \nJanuary 2016, and it falls short of establishing that these two incidents were conditions \nlargely beyond his control. Furthermore, the evidence does not establish that he acted \nresponsibly regarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.h. Shortly after \nhe began his current employment, he bought a car that he could not afford. He did \nnothing to resolve his tax debt from 2015, and it was eventually resolved by an \ninvoluntary capture of his tax refund. However, he acted responsibly regarding the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f and resolved them before he received the SOR. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, and 1.f. It is \nnot established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, because Applicant has \nmade no payments on these debts. A promise to pay a delinquent debt in the future is \nnot a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). Applicants who begin to address their security-\nsignificant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake may be lacking in \njudgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). Applicant is \ncounting on the sale of his home to comply with his promise to pay these debts by May \n31, 2019, but it is unlikely that he will be able to find a buyer, close the sale, and collect \nthe proceeds by that date. The tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h was not resolved through \ngood-faith efforts initiated by Applicant, but rather by involuntary application of a \nsubsequent tax refund. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not fully established. Applicant did not make any arrangements to \npay his tax debt for 2015. Instead, it was collected involuntarily by seizure of his tax \nrefund for 2017. Applicant did not file his 2017 federal income tax return until after he \nwas questioned about it by a security investigator. His belated filing of his 2017 return \n\u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. \nBd. Oct. 30, 2014). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s intentional misuse of a company credit card for an extended time \nperiod, in violation of the terms under which it was issued, establishes the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (3) a \npattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of significant \nmisuse of Government or other employer's time or resources; and \nAG \u00b6 16(f): violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment. \nThe relevant mitigating condition is AG \u00b6 17(c): \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so \nmuch time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such \nunique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d This mitigating condition is not \nestablished. Applicant\u2019s conduct was a serious breach of trust extending over a nine-\nmonth period. It occurred numerous times, was recent, and did not happen under \nunique circumstances. He stopped misusing the credit card only because he was \ncaught, not because of any sense of obligation to his employer. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2 \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have noted that Applicant \nhas satisfied some of his delinquent debts and taken steps to resolve the largest one. \nHowever, his plan for complying with his promises to pay the remaining debts rests on \nthe unlikely possibility that he will be able to find a buyer for his former home, close the \nsale, and collect the proceeds by May 31, 2019, which is only about five weeks away. \nApplicant did not begin to seriously address the large debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, \nand 1.d until it was clear that his security clearance was in jeopardy. He never \naffirmatively addressed the tax debt. Instead, he passively allowed it to be involuntarily \ncollected after he filed his overdue return for 2017. He needs more time to stabilize his \nfinances and establish a track record of financial responsibility. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.38 \nthrough E3.1.40 (reapplication authorized after one year). After weighing the \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n9 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his financial problems and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst\n \nApplicant\n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor\n \nApplicant\n \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \n \nWithdrawn\n \nSubparagraphs 1.h and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst\n \nApplicant\n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

It is \u201cdifficult as an American to gain \naccess to certain services,\u201d such as the \u201cinternet,\u201d and \u201cpaying utilities,\u201d without said \ncard. (Id, and AppX C.) \n \nNotice \n \n \nI take administrative notice of certain facts regarding South Korea. Its \ngovernment espionage and collection activities have resulted in U.S. criminal \nprosecutions. Industrial espionage also remains a high-profile concern relating to South \nKorean companies. \n \n \nI take administrative notice of certain facts regarding Ukraine It is a republic with \na semi-presidential political system. In 2014, Russian forces entered and occupied \nUkraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula. There are significant human rights issues in parts of \nUkraine under Russian occupation. \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B - Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a Ukrainian national, as are his Ukrainian in-laws. His \nmother is a citizen and resident of South Korea. The evidence is sufficient to raise these \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \n \nOther than his wife, Applicant has little contact with his Ukrainian relatives. His \nKorean mother works in support of the U.S. Army in Korea. His father is a U.S. Army \nretiree working for the U.S. Army in Korea as a civilian employee. His American sister \nlives with their parents in Korea. Foreign Influence is found for Applicant. \n \nGuideline C - Foreign Preference \n \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in \nAG \u00b6 9: \n \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \n\n \n6 \n \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10:   \n \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; \n \n(b) failure to report, or fully disclose when required, to an appropriate \nsecurity official, the possession of a passport or identity card issued by \nany country other than the United States; \n \n(c) failure to use a U.S. passport when entering or exiting the U.S.; \n \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in any way that conflicts with \nU.S. national security interests; \n \n(e) using foreign citizenship to protect financial or business interests in \nanother country in violation of U.S. law; and \n \n(f) an act of expatriation from the United States such as declaration of \nintent to renounce U.S. citizenship, whether through words or actions. \n \n  \nNone of these are applicable. Applicant only has an Alien Registration Card so \nthat he can live with some basic necessities in Korea. It shows no Foreign Preference; \nand as such, this guideline is found for Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines B and C in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has \na distinguished history of working in the defense industry, as evidenced by five letters of \nsupport. (AppX B.) He performs well at his job. Applicant is a native-born American, and \ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence and Foreign Preference security \nconcerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nStatement of Case\nOn October 9, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated\nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons\nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine\nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The\naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative\nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017.\n03/29/2019\n\nApplicant responded to the SOR on November 8, 2018, and elected to have her\ncase decided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on January 7, 2019 and interposed no objections to the materials in the\nFORM, and did not supplement the FORM. The case was assigned to me on March 22,\n2019. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated 37 delinquent medical, \nconsumer, and tax debts exceeding $52,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved\nand outstanding.\n                \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but three of the alleged debts.\nShe denied SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.f (a disputed consumer debt for $750), 1.ll (1.ll (a federal tax\ndebt for $2,000 that she disputes as to amount); and 1.mm (a state tax debt for $7,000\nthat she disputes as to amount) She added explanations for the debts she admitted. For\nthese debts she claimed she intends to set payment arrangements to pay off the debts,\nbut is unable to do so at the present time due to her limited income.\nFinding   s   of Fact\nApplicant is a 43-year-old service desk analyst for a defense contractor who seeks\na security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.\nBackground\nApplicant married in 2017 and has two minor children (ages nine and two) from a\nprior relationship. (Items 3-4 and 7) She attended vocational classes between July 2003\nand September 2004, but earned no degree or diploma. She earned a certificate in\ncosmetics in November 2003 and has taken university classes from August to December\n2013 without earning a degree or diploma. (Items 3-4) Applicant reported no military\nservice.\nSince February 2017, Applicant has worked for her current employer. (Item 3)\nPreviously, she worked for other employers in various types of positions. (Item 3) Some\nof Applicant\u2019s past work experience consisted of teaching in private schools (from June\n2005 to March 2009). (Items 3-4)\nApplicant\u2019s finances\nBetween 2008 and 2018, Applicant accumulated 37 delinquent medical, student\nloan, and consumer debts exceeding $43,000. (Items 5-7) Besides these debts, she\nincurred federal and state tax delinquencies for tax year 2014 in the amount of $2,000\n(federal taxes) and $7,000 (state taxes). (Items 5-7)\n2\n\nTo date, Applicant has made no documented progress in addressing listed\ndelinquent debts. While she claimed an intent to work out payment arrangements with her\ncreditors, she cautioned that she was not in a position at this time to pay on any of her\nadmitted debts.\nAddressing the three debts she denies (SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1,f and 1.ll and 1.mm),\nApplicant failed to provide any proof that the disputed 1.f debt did not belong to her, or\nwhat payments she claimed to have made towards satisfaction of the alleged federal and\nstate taxes owing for tax year 2014. Without evidence to corroborate her claims, the\ninformation taken from her credit reports must be accorded presumptive accuracy and\nreliability. (Items 5-7)\nApplicant attributed some of the debt delinquencies to emergent surgical\nprocedures and hospitalization for her son in 2010. Medical bills began accumulating\nfollowing her son\u2019s release from the hospital, and Applicant was unable to keep up with\nthem. (Item 7) Her problems with her accrued medical bills were compounded by the loss\nof both her job and her husband\u2019s job. (Item 7) In a personal subject interview (PSI) with\nan investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in November 2017,\nApplicant confirmed that she joined an on-line support group that provides advice on\nimproving credit scores. (Item 7) She adamantly denied that she was receiving financial\ncounseling and indicated that she will continue to contact her creditors until she has\nestablished payment plans with each of them. (Item 7) To date, however, she has\nprovided no evidence of establishing payment plans with any of her creditors\nApplicant did not provide any character references, performance evaluations, or\npersonal financial information to assess her available income sources and any\nextenuating circumstances to consider in evaluate her overall financial situation.\nPolicies\n                \n       The SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the\ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into\naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant,\nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and\nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and\nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns.\nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require\nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to\nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c).\nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the\npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG\n3\n\n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial\ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines\nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an\napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is\nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\n Viewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual\nguidelines are pertinent in this case:\nFinancial Considerations\n       The Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can\nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of,\nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling,\nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of\ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater\nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to\ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or\ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995).  \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\n4\n\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial\nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that\nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain\na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the\nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or\nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather,\nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation,\nor mitigation.  Based on the requirement of  Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances\nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of\ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations\nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis  \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts:\nmedical, student loan, consumer, and federal and state taxes owed for tax year 2014.\nAltogether, Applicant accumulated over $52,000 in delinquent debts over a five-year\nperiod (2008-2013) that she has not addressed to date. Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies\nwarrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines:\nDC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations.\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local\nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as\nrequired.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts negate the need for any independent\nproof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006).\nEach of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts are fully documented and create some judgment\nissues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security\nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing lapses\nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving federal and state tax\ndelinquencies and other debt delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an\napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and\nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a\n5\n\nsensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR\nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited circumstances (i.e.,\nsurgical procedures for her son and resulting medical bills and unemployment for both\nherself and her husband) are extenuating and entitle Applicant to partial mitigation \ncredit for her inability to address her debt delinquencies. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d\nhas partial application to Applicant\u2019s situation. Her failure to address her debt\ndelinquencies  after she returned to full time employment status precludes her,\nhowever, from taking advantage of the \u201cacted responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6 20(b).\nSimilarly, satisfaction of Applicant\u2019s evidentiary burden of providing probative\nevidence of her addressing her debt delinquencies requires more documentation of her\nworking payment efforts than she has provided in her submissions. While her\nextenuating circumstances are highly probative, they are not enough to mitigate her\nmajor financial delinquencies without more evidence of past and recent efforts to\naddress her delinquent debts.\nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance\nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through\nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of\nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) \nIn Applicant\u2019s case, her failures or inability to establish documented payment initiatives \nwith her listed SOR creditors, both before and after the initiation of the security\nclearance process, prelude favorable findings and conclusions with respect to raised\nsecurity concerns over the state of her finances. \nWhole-Person Assessment\nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. She has shown\ninsufficient  progress to date in addressing her delinquent debts  to merit enough\npositive credit to mitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in\naddressing her finances reflect too little evidence of restored financial responsibility and\njudgment to overcome reasonable doubts about her trustworthiness, reliability, and\nability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. Conclusions are warranted that her\nfinances are not sufficiently stabilized at this time to meet minimum eligibility\nrequirements for holding a security clearance.  Eligibility to hold a security clearance\nunder the facts and circumstances of this case is inconsistent with the national interest.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\n6\n\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT\n  Subparagraphs 1.a-1.mm:\n               Against Applicant\n   \n             \n \nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to\nhold a security clearance.

Schachter, Esq.  \n \n11/12/2019 \n___________ \n \nDecision  \n___________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nApplicant made significant progress resolving her delinquent debts especially after \nshe received the statement of reasons (SOR). However, she used a corporate credit card \nto purchase personal items costing thousands of dollars while she was overseas, and she \nfailed to expeditiously repay the corporation for the personal charges. For two years she \nhas not paid the corporation anything. Personal conduct security concerns are refuted; \nhowever, financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied.        \n  \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn November 28, 2017, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On February 1, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective \nJune 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2)  \n \n\n \n2                                        \n \n \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. Specifically, the \nSOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F (financial considerations) and \nE (personal conduct). (HE 2) On April 22, 2019, Applicant responded to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3)  \n \nOn May 29, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. On July 22, 2019, \nthe case was assigned to me. On July 23, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice, setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for September 26, 2019. (HE \n1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered 3 exhibits; Applicant offered 53 \nexhibits (some of Applicant\u2019s exhibits had multiple parts); there were no objections; and all \nproffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 8-9, 13-18; GE 1-3; Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A-AE BB) On October 7, 2019, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. Applicant \nprovided 20 post-hearing exhibits, which were admitted without objection. (AE Y1-AE FF4) \nSome of Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibits had multiple parts, and some duplicated \npreviously submitted exhibits. AE Y1 through AE BB were given new exhibit numbers \nbecause of exhibits admitted at the hearing. All proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. The record closed on October 28, 2019. (Tr. 141, 149) On October 29, 2019, I \nemailed Applicant\u2019s Counsel and requested that he provide the letter that he promised to \nsend to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.ff and any subsequent response from the creditor. (HE 7) \nI did not receive a response to my post-hearing request. \n \nSome details in this case were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. \nSpecific information is available in the cited exhibits.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \n1.f through 1.p, 1.s, 1.w, 1.x, 1.y, 1.aa, 1.bb, 1.cc, and 1.dd. (HE 3) She partially admitted \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.ff. She denied the other SOR allegations. (HE 3) She \nalso provided extenuating and mitigating information. (HE 3) Her admissions are accepted \nas findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old cybersecurity analyst employed by a defense contractor \nfor the previous 10 months. (Tr. 21) Her resume provides details about her professional \nbackground. (AE U) She was married from 2002 to 2010, and she has no children.

(Tr. 24) She has completed other information \ntechnology training courses. (SOR response; AE A1, A2) \n \n\n \n3                                        \n \n \nApplicant served in the Army from 1995 to 2004. (Tr. 28) She left active duty as a \nsergeant (E-5), and she received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 28; AE FF1) She received \nthe following awards, ribbons, and decorations: Army Achievement Medal (3rd Award); Air \nForce Achievement Medal; National Defense Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal; Noncommissioned Officer (NCO) Professional Development Ribbon; Army \nService Ribbon; and Overseas Service Ribbon. (AE FF1) She successfully completed \nnumerous Army training courses. (AE FF1) Applicant\u2019s enlisted specialty was in \ninformation security. (Tr. 28) Applicant has a service-connected disability, and she \nreceives payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 31-32; AE FF1) She \nwas unemployed from October 2017 to July 2018, from May 2015 to September 2015, \nfrom June 2011 to July 2011, from November 2010 to December 2010, from May 2006 to \nOctober 2008, and from July 2005 to October 2005.

(AE FF4) \n \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges 32 delinquent debts totaling $92,948. Their status is as \nfollows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $18,937. Applicant purchased a used \nvehicle, and she learned that she was unable to afford the payments. (Tr. 29) The vehicle \nwas voluntarily repossessed. (Tr. 29, 37) She started a payment plan after the creditor \nsold the vehicle; however, due to her unemployment, she was unable to continue making \nthe payments. (Tr. 30) On March 9, 2019, the creditor acknowledged receipt of a $100 \npayment. (Tr. 34-35; AE G) The creditor indicated there should be a payment agreement \nestablished enabling the creditor to withdraw $100 monthly from Applicant\u2019s account to \naddress the debt; however, she did not establish the automatic debit from her account. \n(Tr. 38; AE G) The current balance owed according to the creditor was $8,776. (Tr. 32-33; \nAE G; AE Y3) She made a $100 payment in August 2019, and then she stopped making \npayments. (Tr. 33-35; AE Y2) She asked her consolidated debt payment plan (CDPP) to \nadd this debt to her plan. (Tr. 33; AE Z) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off debt for $9,143. Applicant accepted overseas \nemployment; she did not have time to sell the vehicle; and she surrendered the vehicle to \nthe creditor holding a lien on her vehicle resulting in this debt. (Tr. 39, 42) She was \ntransferred overseas in December 2016. (Tr. 44; AE U) She paid $147 in April 2019. (Tr. \n44; AE H) She said she maintained \u201cconstant\u201d communication with the creditor about the \ndebt. (Tr. 41) At her hearing, she estimated the balance owed on the debt was about \n$2,700. (Tr. 43) In August 2019, she paid $100. (AE Z2) In October 2019, the creditor \nagreed to settle the debt for $800, and Applicant paid $800 that same month resolving the \ndebt. (AE Z2-AE Z4)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a debt placed for collections for $1,363. When Applicant was \ntransferred overseas in December 2016, there was confusion over the status of her \naccount. (Tr. 45-50; AE U) When she discovered the creditor sought more money, she \n\n \n4                                        \n \n \nwas unemployed and unable to resolve the debt. (Tr. 46) Applicant paid the creditor a total \nof $1,090, and she made the final payment of $545 on April 19, 2019, resolving the debt. \n(Tr. 46-48; AE I; AE BB2)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a debt placed collection for $5,841. Applicant left an apartment \nand moved to a different state. (Tr. 50) She acknowledged that she broke her lease. (Tr. \n52) In June 2011, her landlord wrote that Applicant \u201cis a current resident in good standing \nat this property. She moved in on 26 August 2009 and has given notice to move out in July \n2011.\u201d (AE J) The creditor\u2019s letter did not mention any charges to be imposed at the \ntermination of the lease. (AE J) The creditor sent information about the delinquent debt to \ncredit reporting companies in September 2011. (Tr. 53; GE 2) Applicant disputed her \nresponsibility for this debt, and she filed disputes with the credit reporting companies in \n2018. (Tr. 50-54) She contacted the creditor; however, Applicant believed the creditor was \nunable to provide information about the debt most likely due to frequent turnover in the \nrental office. (Tr. 53) The debt was removed from all of her current credit reports except \none. (Tr. 51, 54)  \n \nThe SOR alleges 19 medical or dental debts placed for collection totaling $20,156 \nand listed in the following paragraphs: 1.e; 1.f; 1.g; 1.i; 1.j; 1.k; 1.l; 1.n; 1.o; 1.q; 1.s; 1.t; \n1.u; 1.v; 1.w; 1.x; 1.aa; 1.dd; and 1.ee; for the following amounts: $3,647; $3,288; $2,807; \n$2,031; $1,638; $1,246; $1,059; $792; $559; $518; $394; $382; $382; $382; $366; $322; \n$172; $115; and $56.  \n \nApplicant said the SOR and her credit report erroneously list the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nfor $3,647 as a medical debt, and it is actually a debt for employer-sponsored training. (Tr. \n55-56) Her April 2019 credit report shows a $3,769 debt originating in 2015 from the \ncreditor listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e actually resulted from a computer-training course. (AE K2) She \nsaid she disputed her responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. (Tr. 55-57; AE K) She \nshowed that she requested that her employer pay the debt in 2014. (AE AA1; AE AA 2) \nShe received the training. (Tr. 55-59) She believed her employer was paying the debt; \nhowever, she did not provide proof of employer payments. (Tr. 57-58) She said that she \nelected to include the debt in her CDPP; however, it is not listed on her original CDPP plan \nor on her amended October 2019 plan. (Tr. 61-62; AE L; AE EE1) \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.ee allege five medical debts for $518, $382, $382, \n$382, and $56, which are being collected by the same collection agent. Applicant disputed \nthese five debts because the creditor would not describe the treatment she received, and \nin any event, even if the debts were valid, she believed they may be duplicates of other \nmedical debts. (Tr. 81-83, 85-86) TransUnion wrote Applicant and indicated the accounts \nunder collection by the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, and 1.ee were deleted from \nher credit report. (AE O) However, she did not provide Equifax or Experian credit reports. \n \nWhen Applicant was out of work, she did not have medical insurance, and she \naccrued medical bills. (Tr. 62, 73) She accumulated delinquent medical bills in 2011, 2012, \nand 2016. (Tr. 73) She made some payments to address her medical debts when she was \nemployed. (Tr. 62, 74-76; AE Y; AE Z) She paid off several of her medical debts. (Tr. 66-\n67) She decided to employ CDPP to pay her medical debts. (Tr. 62) On April 17, 2019, \n\n \n5                                        \n \n \nshe enrolled in CDPP to address 12 medical or dental SOR debts as well as the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.z for $315, and the non-medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f for $3,288 and 1.h for $2,920. \n(Tr. 64; AE L; AE Z; AE EE1) Her payments to CDPP of $436 were scheduled to begin on \nMay 15, 2019. From May to August 2019, she paid CDPP $2,169 for an average of $434 \nper month for those five months. (AE X1-X5; AE EE2-EE6) She said she was making \npayments to CDPP twice a month. (Tr. 70, 76) The documentation she submitted did not \nshow consistent bimonthly payments to CDPP. In June 2019, she made one $112 \npayment; in July 2019, she did not make any payments; and in August 2019, she paid \n$1,238 bringing her CDPP account current as of August 2019. (AE EE1-EE6) On June 27, \n2019, CDPP emailed Applicant and informed her that two medical debts and the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.z were paid. (AE V) On October 22, 2019, she changed her monthly \u201cauto pay\u201d \npayment to $358. (AE EE1 at 2) She did not provide documentation showing payments in \nSeptember and October 2019.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a debt placed for collection owed to a dating service for $2,573.  \nApplicant believed the services provided were not equal to those promised, and she \ndisputed her responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 72) Ultimately, she accepted responsibility for \nthe debt, and she placed the debt on her list for CDPP resolution. (Tr. 70-71; AE L; AE \nEE1) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $853. On \nMarch 22, 2019, Applicant paid the creditor $598, and the creditor said the debt is \u201csettled \nin full.\u201d (Tr. 79-80; AE M) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.p alleges a vehicle insurance debt placed for collection for $533. On April \n2, 2019, the creditor wrote that the balance owed was zero, and the debt was settled in \nfull. (Tr. 80; AE N) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.r alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $463. Applicant disputed \nher responsibility for this debt. (Tr. 84) She said she called the creditor; however, the \ncreditor was unable to find any information on her account. (Tr. 84) She disputed the debt, \nand TransUnion wrote the debt was deleted from the TransUnion credit report. (AE O) She \nconceded the debt remained on one of her other credit reports. (Tr. 84-85)  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.y and 1.z allege two payday-loan debts placed for collection by the same \ncollection agency for $315 and $315. On May 28, 2019, Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.y for $315. (Tr. 87-89; AE O; AE W; AE DD) In June 2019, CDPP informed Applicant \nthat the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.z was paid. (AE V)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.bb alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $151. On April 2, 2019, \nApplicant paid this debt. (Tr. 89-90; AE P)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.cc alleges a telecommunications debt placed for collection for $128. On \nApril 2, 2019, Applicant paid this debt. (Tr. 90; AE Q) \n \nApplicant received financial counseling. (Tr. 33-34; AE T) Applicant\u2019s February \n2019 budget indicates the following monthly amounts: gross income of $8,643; net income \n\n \n6                                        \n \n \nof $7,911; expenses and liabilities of $4,541 (rent is shown as $1,350 and $1,530); and \nremainder of $6,571. (AE S) Usually the remainder is calculated by subtracting the \nexpenses and liabilities from the net income, and using this calculation, the remainder \nwould be $3,370. \n \nCorporate Credit Card \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.ff alleges Applicant improperly charged $32,177 to a corporate credit card, \nand her employer terminated her employment in September 2017. SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-\nalleges the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.ff as a personal conduct security concern. \n \nIn about November 2016, Applicant accepted a position in Europe. (Tr. 91, 112-\n113) Her employer asked her to spend two weeks in Southwest Asia doing audits or audit \ntraining. (Tr. 91, 114) She stayed in Southwest Asia from about December 2016 to March \nor April 2017, a period of about three months. (Tr. 114-115, 120) She traveled from Europe \nto Southwest Asia twice. (Tr. 120) She was employed when she was in Europe and \nSouthwest Asia. (Tr. 114) She stayed in a hotel for her first few days in Southwest Asia, \nand her hotel expenses were properly charged on her corporate credit card. (Tr. 115, 119) \nMost of the time she was in Southwest Asia, she stayed in an apartment, and her rent was \nnot charged on her corporate credit card because her employer paid for her apartment. \n(Tr. 114-115) There was a per diem amount that limited the amount she would be \nreimbursed for meals. (Tr. 117)  \n \nApplicant understood that she would be submitting a reconciliation of her expenses \nafter she returned to Europe. (Tr. 117) She purchased airline tickets and paid for a rental \ncar with her corporate card. (Tr. 118, 121, 130) She received oral authorization to charge \nthe rental car on her corporate credit card. (Tr. 130-131) After she returned to Europe, she \nsubmitted her expense reports related to her time in Europe and Southwest Asia. (Tr. 121-\n122) She was in Europe until October 2018. (Tr. 121) Her employer disputed her charge \nfor flying business class on one occasion; however, she believed it was authorized \nbecause of the circumstances in a country where she waited for a connecting flight. (Tr. \n122, 132-133) She purchased clothing using her corporate credit card, such as a jacket; \nhowever, she believed this expense was authorized. (Tr. 122) She also purchased a \nprinter for her computer using her corporate credit card. (Tr. 130) She was unable to \nprovide information about most of her purchases on her corporate credit card.  \n \nApplicant provided some emails to and from her employer to clarify and corroborate \nher statement about her use of the corporate credit card. On November 30, 2016, she \nemailed her supervisor: \n \nI went over my finances last night and I have already spent quite a bit \npreparing for this trip. So I know my corporate card may not be ready but \npaying [for] a few nights in a hotel may not be ideal if the company is not \ntaking care of it. Just want to be upfront so there will be no issues.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7                                        \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor responded in an email as follows: \n \nUnderstood, we will cover the expenses, just won\u2019t pay out immediately if \nyou have to expense it, hence my concern. I am working an angle on \naccommodations, might be able to directly cover it, so you won\u2019t have to \nexpense it. I am requesting a corporate card for you, but not sure yet when \nyou might get your hands on it. Shooting to get this [resolved] by the end of \nthe week. \n \nOn October 6, 2017, Applicant emailed her supervisor and one other person: \n \nI am currently planning how I will pay for the next couple months [of] \npayments before I start a new position. I would like to know if the company \nwill be denying unemployment benefits. So I know if this is an option as a \nsource for repayment or not. Thank you ma\u2019am. \n \n(AE R) \n \nOn November 28, 2017, Applicant reported the following information in her SCA: \n \nI did use the corporate credit card for personal use and work related use. I \nwas told that if we used it for personal use to pay it off right away. I also \nused it for work transportation and lodging, flight to [Europe] from \n[Southwest Asia] when I first moved, etc. . . . I tried to expense report much \nof it since the company was to pay for a lot of it and they rejected it. I was \nthen asked [to] pay it all back in one lump sum. I could not so I was \nterminated. I came up with a payment plan and showed where they did not \ntake care of things they said they would initially. We agreed upon the \ntermination and repayment of the card though they are not responding for \nnext payment. I have informed them of my recent job acceptance and my \ngood faith in paying my debt.   \n \n(GE 1 at 19) Applicant\u2019s SCA states, \u201cProvide the amount (in U.S. dollars) of violation:\u201d \nand Applicant responded, \u201c$25,000 (Estimated).\u201d (GE 1 at 61) She provided an \nexplanation about what she was doing to take corrective action as follows: \n \nI have started paying the card back and have an arrangement with the \ncompany to pay back monthly and again when I start working again. I paid \na good faith payment before I left Italy [in] September [2017]. I have since \ntried to contact the POC and Human Resources to let them know I had \nsecured a new job and how [I] would like to know a better way to send a \npayment since I would be Afghanistan because I really want to pay my debt. \nI have received no answer from the POC or human resources. I have email \nto show this.   \n \n(GE 1 at 61) She provided no emails from her former employer agreeing to a monthly \npayment plan. She provided no emails to her former employer explaining she was now \n\n \n8                                        \n \n \nemployed, and she did not provide any evidence of any payments after her October 6, \n2017 email to her former employer.   \n \nOn December 12, 2017, Applicant emailed her employer, \u201cThis is my third email to \nget in contact with you about paying my debt back. Can you please respond? Thank you.\u201d \nOn December 13, 2017, a representative of her employer emailed Applicant, \u201cJust send \nus a check for the full outstanding amount. Please respond.\u201d (Tr. 103-104; AE R) \nApplicant did not provide her response, if any, to her former employer\u2019s email of \nDecember 13, 2017. \n \nApplicant provided additional information about her stay in Southwest Asia from \nabout December 2016 to April 2017. Applicant was supposed to work at a DOD facility in \nSouthwest Asia. (Tr. 92) When she arrived in Southwest Asia, she \u201cdidn\u2019t have a job. [She] \nbasically sat there.\u201d (Tr. 92) She received a corporate credit card, and her supervisor orally \nsaid she could use it for reasonable expenses. (Tr. 92, 126; AE R) She understood that \nshe could pay it back once she started to work again after she returned to Europe. (Tr. 92) \nAfter she returned to Europe, her employer audited her credit card, and told her she was \nonly authorized to use the credit card for official business. (Tr. 92) Her employer asked her \nto pay the charges on her card. (Tr. 93) She made one $2,000 payment with a cashier\u2019s \ncheck shortly after she returned to Europe from Southwest Asia; however, she did not \nreceive a receipt showing this payment. (Tr. 101, 107, 124) At her hearing, she said 90 \npercent of the charges on her corporate credit card were for business purposes, and the \nremainder were for personal expenses. (Tr. 94, 96-97) However, in her SOR response, \nher attorney wrote that she \u201cestimates that about $10,000 of the balance was for personal \nuse.\u201d (SOR response) She did not use the corporate credit card for blatantly improper \npurchases such as gambling or purchase of illegal drugs. (Tr. 98) Applicant had a personal \ncredit card in Southwest Asia; however, it had a maximum limit of $250. (Tr. 110)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor told her to make sure she paid back their employer. (Tr. 127) \nHe said, \u201cPay them off as soon as possible.\u201d (Tr. 127) She understood that she could \ncharge personal expenses; however, she had to repay those charges later. (Tr. 134-135) \nShe acknowledged that she did not reimburse her employer for all of her personal \nexpenses. (Tr. 128) She said she believed she did not retain copies of her expense reports. \n(Tr. 128-129) Her employer never filed a lawsuit to collect the funds from Applicant. (Tr. \n137)  \n \nApplicant said her employer was able to review her charges on her card on the \nInternet; however, she was unable to see the charges because she was no longer \nemployed by the company. (Tr. 94-95) Applicant indicated the amount of the debt as \n$32,177 related to an amount on a promissory note. (Tr. 106-107) Applicant did not \nprovide: a copy of the promissory note; the documentation supporting the amount owed; \nand/or a copy of her employer\u2019s rules, policies, or regulations regarding appropriate \ncharges on her employer\u2019s corporate credit card.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s counsel said he wanted to submit a post-hearing-generated letter to the \ncreditor asking for a copy of the bank statements pertaining to the corporate credit card \nthat would show which charges were personal and which charges were corporate. (Tr. \n\n \n9                                        \n \n \n101, 105, 108-109) The letter to the creditor was supposed to be submitted as an exhibit \nafter the hearing. (Tr. 108-109, 140-142) I did not receive the letter to the creditor. (HE 7) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \n \n\n \n10                                        \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record \nestablishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c).  \n \n \n \n\n \n11                                        \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleges 32 delinquent debts totaling $92,948. Her finances were \ndamaged by divorce, medical problems, and unemployment. These circumstances were \nlargely beyond her control. However, she did not act responsibly under the circumstances \nbecause she did not take sufficient action to resolve her debt to her former corporate \nemployer. \n\n \n12                                        \n \n \nApplicant took some important steps towards showing her financial responsibility. \nShe paid some debts or made payments towards other debts before the SOR was issued. \nShe paid or settled and paid the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.m, 1.y, 1.z, 1.bb, and 1.cc \nafter the SOR was issued. She placed or promised to place the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, \n1.f, 1.g, 1.i through 1.l, 1.n through 1.q, 1.s through 1.x, 1.aa, 1.dd, and 1.ee into her debt \npayment plan after the SOR was issued. However, some mitigating credit is lost because \nthese actions were not taken until after the SOR was issued. The Appeal Board has \nstated: \n \n[T]he timing of ameliorative action is a factor which should be brought to \nbear in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. An applicant who \nbegins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice \nthat his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests \nare not threatened.  \n \nISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019) (reversing grant of a security \nclearance and citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). \n  \nShe disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.r. When she contacted these two \ncreditors they were unable or unwilling to provide corroboration of the amount of the debt.  \n \nThe debt owed to Applicant\u2019s former employer alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.ff is not \nmitigated. She has not made any payments for about two years. When she used the \ncorporate credit card for personal purchases, this was akin to an emergency situation. \nShe was in a foreign country without the means to pay for basic personal necessities. \nShe was derelict in her responsibilities for not seeking documented proof that she was \nauthorized to charge personal expenses on her corporate credit card. She emailed her \nsupervisor about her expenses, and he authorized her to charge expenses in an email. \nHowever, her email to her supervisor was not clear about her desire to charge personal \nexpenses on her corporate credit card. In any event, she admitted that she knew that she \nneeded to immediately repay her employer for the personal expenses charged on her \ncorporate card upon the termination of her travel. She was employed from December \n2016 to October 2017. (AE U)  \n \nApplicant said she paid her former employer $2,000 in 2017, and she \nacknowledged that she made about $3,000 (hearing statement), about $10,000 (SOR \nresponse), or about $25,000 (SCA) in personal charges on her corporate credit card. \nApplicant\u2019s resume (AE U) indicates she has extensive business and corporate \ninformation technology experience. With her professional background and experience it \nis difficult to understand why she would not retain documentation of her personal and \nbusiness expenses, a copy of the promissory note, and receipts. She says she did not \nkeep her own copy of receipts or a copy of her reconciliation of her corporate credit card \ncharges. Her budget indicates she has a substantial monthly remainder available to \naddress her debts, and she did not prove that if she submitted payments her former \nemployer would refuse to accept them. She did not meet her burden of establishing that \n\n \n13                                        \n \n \nshe acted reasonably and responsibly in regard to the SOR \u00b6 1.ff debt. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \n AG \u00b6 16 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior . . . ; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant misused a corporate credit card by charging \npersonal items on it, and she was terminated from her employment. The foundation for \nthese allegations is Applicant\u2019s statements. She consistently denied unauthorized use of \nher corporate credit card. There is no evidence that her employer trained Applicant on \nuse of her corporate credit card. Applicant mistakenly believed she could use her \ncorporate credit card for personal expenses while overseas. Applicant refuted the \nallegation that she intentionally committed theft or misappropriated her employer\u2019s funds. \n\n \n14                                        \n \n \nThe record evidence does not establish Applicant engaged in crimen falsi or intentional \nfalsehood. Applicant\u2019s statements of lack of deceit and theft are accepted as credible. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are refuted.   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 42-year-old cybersecurity analyst employed by a defense contractor \nfor the previous 10 months. Her resume provides details about her professional \nbackground. She has three years of college, and she majored in cybersecurity. She \nvolunteers in her community and assists several professional organizations. She recently \nsuccessfully completed the CISP Examination, and she has completed other information \ntechnology training courses. She served in the Army from 1995 to 2004; she left active \nduty as a sergeant; and she received an honorable discharge. She received some Army \nawards, ribbons, and decorations, and successfully completed numerous Army training \ncourses. Applicant has a service-connected disability, and she receives payments from \nthe VA.  \n \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control harmed her finances, including periods \nof unemployment, divorce, and medical problems. She showed substantial progress \nresolving most of her delinquent debts particularly after the SOR was issued on February \n1, 2019.  \n \nApplicant has known that she owed a substantial debt to her former employer, and \nfor two years she has not submitted any payments to her former employer. Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to \u201csatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack \nof judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n15                                        \n \n \nquestions about [his] reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16. \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are refuted; however, financial considerations security concerns lead me to \nconclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.ee: \n  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ff: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 2.a: \n \n  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He was born, raised, and educated in Iraq, immigrating to the United States in 2008, and becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013. (Item 3) Since 2017, he has worked for a defense contractor as a linguist. Applicant has a history of working in positions supporting the United States and its allies\u2019 interest in Iraq. From 2005 to 2008, he was a security guard for a defense contractor of a coalition country. In this capacity, he provided protection for several senior-level U.S. and coalition officials. (Item 2 at 2) He carried a gun and experienced combat multiple times. (Item 4 at 5) Shortly after immigrating to the United States in 2008, Applicant returned to Iraq to work as a translator, where he worked for the next three years through December 2011. (Item 3 at 19) This job was dangerous also, as three of his fellow translators were killed during this period. (Item 3 at 11) Applicant\u2019s mother and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. His father is deceased. His sisters are students, and they live with their mother. (Item 2 at 2) His mother\u2019s occupation is unknown from the record. Applicant\u2019s mother owns two homes in Iraq that together are worth approximately $950,000 USD. (Item 2 at 1) She lives in one of the properties with her daughters. Because of the political climate in Iraq, Applicant has no interest in any ownership rights that he may one day receive through inheritance. Applicant\u2019",

Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 19, 2018 the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline B (foreign influence). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, effective June 8, 2017. The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the Government, DOD adjudicators \ncould not make the affirmative finding that it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue his security clearance. It recommended that his \ncase be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether his clearance \nshould be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                              \nOn December 19, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitting all of the \nallegations, and requested a decision on the written record instead of a hearing. On \nMarch 11, 2019, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). In \nthe FORM, Department Counsel withdrew subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, and added \nsubparagraph 1.h. (FORM at 2)  Applicant received a copy of the FORM on March 22, \n2019, and was notified of his opportunity to prepare a response and to admit or deny \nthe supplementary allegation set forth in subparagraph 1.h.. He did not respond, \nconsequently, I will construe his non-answer to subparagraph 1.h as a denial. On June \n14, 2019, the case was assigned to me. \n \nI incorporated the Government\u2019s proposed exhibits, marked as Items 1 through 6, \ninto the record. Also, I have taken administrative notice of the facts set forth in 11 \ndocuments submitted by the Government, marked as Items I through XI. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 34-year-old married man with four children. He was born, raised, \nand educated in Iraq, immigrating to the United States in 2008, and becoming a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2013. (Item 3) Since 2017, he has worked for a defense \ncontractor as a linguist. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of working in positions supporting the United States and \nits allies\u2019 interest in Iraq. From 2005 to 2008, he was a security guard for a defense \ncontractor of a coalition country. In this capacity, he provided protection for several \nsenior-level U.S. and coalition officials. (Item 2 at 2) He carried a gun and experienced \ncombat multiple times. (Item 4 at 5) \n \n \nShortly after immigrating to the United States in 2008, Applicant returned to Iraq \nto work as a translator, where he worked for the next three years through December \n2011. (Item 3 at 19) This job was dangerous also, as three of his fellow translators were \nkilled during this period. (Item 3 at 11)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. His father is \ndeceased. His sisters are students, and they live with their mother. (Item 2 at 2) His \nmother\u2019s occupation is unknown from the record. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother owns two homes in Iraq that together are worth approximately \n$950,000 USD. (Item 2 at 1) She lives in one of the properties with her daughters. \nBecause of the political climate in Iraq, Applicant has no interest in any ownership rights \nthat he may one day receive through inheritance.  \n \n \n  Applicant\u2019s mother, together with several other families, own 300 acres of \nfarmland in Iraq that is worth approximately $20 million. (Item 2 at 1) His mother\u2019s family \nhas owned this land for hundreds of years. Applicant believes that his mother owns \napproximately 150 acres, but is unsure, as no transfers have ever been legally \nrecorded. (Item 2 at 1, Item 6 at 2) The number of family members who share \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \nownership and the lack of clear title would complicate any effort to sell any interest in it, \nmaking its practical value much less than the estimated value. (Item 2 at 1) There is no \nrecord evidence of what, if any, interest that Applicant has in this property.  \n \n \nBetween 2005 and 2010, Applicant provided $70,000 in financial support to his \nmother. Much of this money was spent repairing her second home, which was damaged \nduring the sectarian violence that was then occurring. (Item 2 at 1) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. (Item 5 at 24) He works for a \nprivate security company as a visa coordinator. Applicant communicates with him \nweekly. (Item 5 at 24) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife became a U.S. citizen since the security clearance process was \ninitiated. His children are now U.S. citizens by virtue of him and his wife becoming U.S. \ncitizens. (Item 2 at 1) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. (HE I at 1) Although the Iraqi \ngovernment has made impressive gains over the years towards curbing terrorism, \nsignificant problems remain, as the Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) continues to \nexert influence in parts of the country. (HE III at 1; HE VII at 2) The U.S. Embassy \nwarns that U.S. citizens are at high risk for kidnapping and violence, and to avoid all but \nessential travel to Iraq. (Item II at 1) The U.S. government considers the potential threat \nto U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and \nwork under strict security guidelines. (HE III at 2) \n  \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder this guideline, \u201cforeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, \nbusiness, financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance.\u201d (AG \u00b6 6) Iraq has made significant strides towards stability over \nthe past few years. However, terrorism remains a problem, anti-western sentiment \nremains high, and banditry remains rampant, particularly against U.S. interests. These \npervasive problems, trigger the application of the following disqualifying conditions, vis a \nvis Applicant\u2019s relatives in Iraq, under AG \u00b6 7: \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s property interests in Iraq heighten his vulnerability \nto coercion through her, there is no record evidence that Applicant has any ownership \ninterest in these properties. Whether he may one day inherit property in Iraq is not \nrelevant to the foreign influence analysis, as such a situation \u201cis full of possibilities that \nmay or may not occur.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 97-0403 (May 13, 1998) at 3) Consequently, \nAG \u00b6 7(f), \u201csubstantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, or in \nany foreign-owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the individual to a \nheightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest,\u201d does \nnot apply. \n \n \nApplicant has a history of supporting U.S. interests in Iraq under dangerous \nconditions, first, as a security guard, and later, as a translator. Both jobs were \ndangerous, as he faced combat a number of times while working as a security guard, \nand lost several fellow translators who worked with him when he served as a translator. \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \nHaving risked his life to further U.S. interests in Iraq, I am confident that Applicant would \nresolve any potential conflict generated by his relatives, living in Iraq, with the U.S. \ninterest. AG \u00b6 8(b), \u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense \nof loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or \ncountry is so nominal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest,\u201d applies. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the foreign influence security concern. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nI addressed the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of Applicant\u2019s history of \nservice in the U.S. interest and how it minimizes his vulnerability to coercion. \n \nFormal Finding \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b:  \n \n \n \nWITHDRAWN \n  \n \n \n \n  \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \n \n__________________________ \nMarc Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n",

After a thorough and complete review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 41 years old and has worked as a supervisor for a defense contractor since June 2017. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 21 years and was honorably discharged in 2017 with the rank of gunnery sergeant (E-7).

Applicant has a history of financial difficulties. He testified and presented \na substantial amount of documentary evidence in mitigation of the security concerns \nraised by his past actions. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 12, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended \n(Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after \nJune 8, 2017. \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 22, 2018, admitting with explanations \neach of the six allegations in the SOR. He requested an administrative determination and \nwaived a hearing before an administrative judge. On November 14, 2018, Department \nCounsel requested a hearing and notified Applicant. Applicant then retained counsel, who \nentered her appearance on November 19, 2018. The case was assigned to another \nadministrative judge and then reassigned to me on December 12, 2018. On the same \nday, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \nscheduling the hearing on January 9, 2019, via video teleconference.  \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered five \ndocuments, which were pre-marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-5. Applicant offered \n14 exhibits, which were pre-marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A though N. All exhibits \nwere admitted without objection. I left the record open until January 23, 2019, to give \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional evidence. On January 15, 2019, Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel sent an email to me and Department Counsel with three additional exhibits \nattached. I marked the exhibits as AE O, P, and Q. Department Counsel had no objection \nto the admissibility of these supplemental exhibits, and I admitted them into the record. I \nalso marked the email thread regarding Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submission as Hearing \nExhibit I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on January 25, 2019. (Tr.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted, with explanations, all six allegations in the SOR. I have \nincorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. Applicant\u2019s personal information is \nextracted from GE 1, his security clearance application, dated July 24, 2017, unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and \ncomplete review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \nApplicant is 41 years old and has worked as a supervisor for a defense contractor \nsince June 2017. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps for 21 years and was honorably \ndischarged in 2017 with the rank of gunnery sergeant (E-7). Applicant has held a security \nclearance since 1995, which was renewed in 2007. He has been married for 20 years \nand has three children and a stepchild. In 2009, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \ninformation-technology management. (Tr. 11-12.) \n \nOn July 24, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in \nconnection with his new employment with a defense contractor. He disclosed in his SCA \nthat in 2013, while he was assigned to duties in Japan and his wife was unable to work, \nthey sought financial guidance from a legitimate, professional counseling company (the \nCounselor) to help them budget their expenses and to pay off their debts in an orderly \nmanner. They set up a three-plus year payment plan, which he reported would end in \nOctober 2017. The plan provided for the resolution of about 12 debts that totaled about \n$13,000. He actually made the last payment in April or May of 2018. In April 2017, \nApplicant also hired a credit repair firm to help him remove debts from his credit report \n\n \n3 \n \nthat were lingering after the debts were resolved. (GE 1 at 37-38; Tr. 36, 40, 45, and 48-\n49; AE K.) \nThe SOR alleges a 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and five delinquent \ndebts, consisting of a $30,000 debt owed to a solar energy company (SOR \u00b6 1.e), a \ncharged-off personal loan in the amount of $2,809 (SOR \u00b6 1.b, ), a balance due on a car \nloan in the amount of $812 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), a credit-card debt in the amount of $143 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d), and a bill related to the adoption of a dog in the amount of $67 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nApplicant\u2019s most significant delinquent debts arose in 2014 when his posting in Japan, \ncaused him some significant financial distress.  \n \nIn January 2013, Applicant received accompanied-overseas orders for a \npermanent station change to Japan. Prior to his transfer in May 2013, Applicant and his \nfamily lived in a home that he owned in the United States. After his relocation, he rented \nthe house for a period, but lost the tenant in late 2013. From his duty station in Japan, he \nwas unable to find a reliable tenant. He was forced to pay $2,100 per month without the \nbenefit of his basic housing allowance since he and his family lived on base in Japan. He \nincurred a number of debts and hired the Counselor to help resolve them. The two largest \nSOR debts discussed below (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e) arose during this period and could not \nbe resolved by ICDS\u2019s debt consolidation process. In October 2015, he managed to sell \nhis U.S. home in a short sale that resolved his mortgage delinquency, and to pay off most \nof his debts with the help of the Counselor. The five SOR debts are the exceptions. (Tr. \n21-25, 46; SOR Response at 1; AE B; GE 2 at 6.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial condition worsened in May 2015 when his daughter was \ndiagnosed with a serious, long-term illness that required that she return to the United \nStates for treatment. She was hospitalized for four months. His wife and daughter \nimmediately moved to Hawaii, and Applicant followed later after receiving a hardship \ntransfer. The sudden relocation as well as his daughter\u2019s medical care caused significant \nfamily expenses and further aggravated his financial distress. (Tr. 31-33, 46.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: 2005 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant was confronted with financial \ndifficulties during a ten-month deployment in a war zone in 2004 to early 2005. He sought \nfinancial assistance to prepare a family budget at the beginning of his deployment, which \nworked well until December 2004, when his wife become seriously ill and was \nincapacitated. Their children were put in day care, which was expensive, and his wife got \nbehind in their bills. He sought financial assistance from a debt-consolidation company \nthat recommended that he file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He did so, and his debts, which \ntotaled $39,410, were discharged in May 2005. He kept his two cars out of the bankruptcy \nand continued making payments on them. (SOR Response at 1 and 9; GE 3 at 3; Tr. 17-\n20 and 42.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: Financing debt for solar energy panels charged off in the amount \nof $30,338. Applicant opened this account in October 2011 in the approximate amount of \n$26,000 to pay for the installation of solar-energy panels on the roof of his house. He \ndefaulted on this account in or about August 2014, at a time when he was prioritizing the \npayment of the mortgage on the property. The creditor refused to work out a payment \n\n \n4 \n \narrangement with the Counselor, which Applicant had engaged in August 2014 to help \nhim. The creditor repossessed the solar panels and charged off the entire account. In an \nemail from the creditor, dated November 21, 2018, three years after the repossession of \nthe equipment, Applicant was advised that the creditor retained the solar system in full \nsatisfaction for the amount owed under his contract and reported a zero balance on the \naccount. This debt was dropped from the Government\u2019s credit report, dated September \n17, 2018. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 29-32, 51-53; AE C, E; GE 5.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: loan account charged off in the amount of $2,809. In December \n2012, Applicant took out this personal loan in the approximate amount of $3,800 to pay \nfor household goods and expenses. He defaulted on the loan in or about September 2014 \nwhen he was stationed overseas and his daughter became ill. In November 2018, he \nentered into a settlement and payment plan with the creditor under which they reduced \nthe debt to $1,824 and agreed to accept payments of $180 for a ten-month period, ending \nin August 2019. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. 20-24, 42-43; AE I and Q.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: car-loan account referred to collection in the amount $812. \nApplicant purchased a car in November 2010 and was obligated to pay $546 a month for \nfive years. He traded the car in when he purchased his current car. He believed that the \ncar dealership that took his old car as a trade was responsible for paying off the balance \nof the loan so that the dealership could obtain a clean title to the car. In September 2016, \nhe received a letter from the creditor claiming he owed this additional amount. He tried to \nwork with dealership that sold him the original car and the dealership that accepted that \ncar as a trade for his new car, but neither would accept responsibility. To clear the debt \noff his credit report, he paid it in August 2018, which was prior to the issuance of the SOR. \nHe attached to his SOR Response a letter from the creditor, dated August 29, 2018, which \nadvised Applicant that his account has been paid in full and closed. This debt has been \nresolved. (Tr. 24-26; SOR Response at 10; GE 4.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: delinquent credit card account debt in the amount of $143. \nApplicant opened this credit card account in August 2011. He defaulted on paying this \naccount in 2014. He made payments on the original debt of about $640 through the \nCounselor. He understood the debt was fully paid, but he was told by the background \ninvestigator that he still owed the bank a small amount and that the debt had been \ncharged off. He then contacted the bank and the collection agency that owned the debt. \nThe collection agency offered a settlement of $104, and Applicant paid it. Applicant \nsubmitted an exhibit which reflects that this account has a $0 balance. This debt has been \nresolved. (Tr. 26-29; AE P.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: account referred to collection in the amount of $67. This debt was \nincurred when he and his family adopted a dog in 2012. He thought he paid this charge \nat the time of the adoption and believes the debt is a mistake. He learned about the debt \nat the time of his background interview. It had not appeared on the credit reports he had \npreviously reviewed. On November 20, 2018, he paid the collection agency to have the \ndebt removed from his credit report. This debt has been resolved. (Tr. 34-36; AE H.) \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant submitted three reference letters, two from fellow members of the Marine \nCorps and one from a co-worker. They all describe Applicant as a highly trusted, \nprofessional, and dedicated Marine, now retired. One reference commented that \nApplicant always took responsibility for his mistakes. He did exactly that during his \nbackground interview and during his testimony at the hearing. His co-worker wrote that \nApplicant has excellent judgment and is highly trustworthy. (AE A.) \n \n \nApplicant has been awarded six Navy Achievement Medals and three Navy \nCommendation Medals. He has been assigned to eight overseas tours away from his \nfamily, three of which were combat tours in war zones. He provided copies of these \nawards along with copies of many others he has received from the Navy over his 20 years \nof service. He also provided a detailed budget that shows a net monthly remainder of \n$3,325. He follows the budget carefully and pays all of his expenses.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony and the documentary evidence in the record \nestablish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indication that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAll of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s debts \narose a number of years ago, and for the most part, were resolved well before the SOR. \nApplicant has shown that his financial difficulties are unlikely to recur and that his history \nof financial problems does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment. Many factors contributing to his difficulties were due to circumstances beyond \nhis control, specifically, his assignment to Japan, which caused him to have to rent his \nhome to tenants who proved to be unreliable, his loss of his basic housing allowance \nwhile in Japan, and his daughter\u2019s serious illness. When faced with these problems, \nApplicant took a proactive approach by seeking counseling and debt-consolidation \nservices from a legitimate and credible source, which were helpful for the most part.  \n \nThose debts Applicant could not restructure were resolved by the repossession of \nthe solar equipment from his home followed by the short sale of the residence. He \narranged for and has adhered to a payment plan that is resolving his only other significant \ndebt. He paid the others off. He has received professional help to teach him family \nbudgeting, and he now has his expenses under control, making it unlikely that he will find \nhimself with delinquent debts again. With his one remaining debt, he is adhering a to a \ngood-faith plan to repay this debt in a few months. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\n\n \n8 \n \nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The factors are:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, evaluating all the evidence in the context of the \nwhole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nfinancial history. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1. Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented, I conclude that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant continued \neligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \nJohn Bayard Glendon \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nOctober 17, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \n \nApplicant timely  answered the SOR and elected to have his case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file \nof relevant material (FORM) on February 6, 2019. Applicant received the FORM on \nFebruary 20, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM  and identified as \n\n2 \n \nItems 1 through 6, is admitted without objection. Applicant responded to the FORM with \na packet of documents, which was marked as Applicant Exhibit A, and admitted into the \nrecord without objection. The case was assigned to me on April 4, 2019. Based on my \nreview of the documentary evidence, I find that Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconcerns. \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nApplicant is a 59-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is married, and he \nhas three adult children. (Item 3) He served in the U.S. Air Force on active duty, receiving \nan honorable discharge.

(Items 1, 8) Applicant admitted  the debts \nlisted on the SOR. (Item 2) His credit reports confirm the  delinquent debts. (Items 5, 6, \n7) \n \n \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to medical issues, unemployment on three \noccasions over the past two years, his mother\u2019s illness and death, four family member \ndeaths, and a knee surgery in 2012. (AX A) In addition, Applicant\u2019s unexpected heart \nattack in 2014, while being the power of attorney for his ailing mother who passed in 2016, \nexacerbated his expenses. Applicant\u2019s older brother died one year before his mother. His \ncousin died in 2017. Funeral trips and expenses decreased his ability to pay all bills in a \ntimely fashion.  \n \n \nApplicant explained during his August 2017 investigative interview that after \nseveral bad years financially due to the myriad issues listed above, his financial situation \nis improving. (Item 10) He is working with all creditors. He understands that his credit took \na downturnl the last few years due to caring for his mother emotionally and financially. \nHis financial situation is getting back on track. (Item 10)    \n \n \nSOR 1.a is a loan now owed by another company. Applicant established contact \nwith the company. He has had to track down to whom the debt is owed. He  has a payment \nplan in place. (AX A) \n \n \nAs to SOR allegations 1.b to 1.h, Applicant stated that he had some student loans \nthat he fell behind with payments.

Also, \nhe submitted as a response to FORM, documentation that he completed the forebearance \nand rehabilitation process.The student loan in 1.b,  was settled and Applicant has satisfied \nthe debt. Applicant showed two payments of $453 were made. He also made some \npayments in 2017. (AX A) As to the remaining student loans, Applicant has a payment \nplan of  to pay $766 monthly for 36 months.This will total $27,600. The six student loans \nare now  rehabilitated; and he is not past due on any balance. He submitted receipts. (AE \nA) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1 i., Applicant provided documentation that he paid the judgment and \ndisputes that he owes this amount. He contacted the attorney in the proper county and \nhas not heard back. This was the result of a loan that his wife obtained prior to Applicant\u2019s \nperiod of unemployment. (Item 10) However in his packet to the response to the FORM, \nhe submitted a form from the court that stated the judgment is satisified. (AX A) \n \n \nAs to SOR 1.j, Applicant candidly addressed the issue of the tax lien ($5,457) as \na result of personal taxes being mistakenly sent to the wrong state. He hired an \naccountant to correct a tax refund. He submitted his pay stub as proof that state one  was \nlisted as his residence and a 2016 letter for request of nonresident  tax refund in the \namount of $2,569 . Applicant also submitted a turbo tax report that confirmed $5,071 was \ntax taken from his wages and given to state one.  Applicant submitted a 2016 letter to the \nComptroller of state two  to process an amended income tax form. This documentation \nshows that state taxes were properly paid to state two and Applicant was due refunds. \n(AX A) Nonpayment of state taxes, although, discussed in the FORM, are not evident in \nthe record or the investigative interview in 2017. \n \n \nApplicant provided documentation that he has paid non-SOR debts that were \nmentioned in the FORM, but not the allegations. He is current with his mortgage and has \npaid a large water bill in the total amount of $3,252 with monthly payments of at least \n$250. Applicant submitted the payment history as proof of payments. (AX A) His credit \nbureau report from 2016 reveals many accounts that are paid as agreed. He provided \ndocumentation to prove his claim.

The five listed \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nApplicant is married and has three children. He has worked in the contracting field \nfor many years. A string of extraordinary events occurred in his life within a short span of \ntime. He acted responsibly. He has addressed his student loans and the other delinquent \ndebts. Some are satisfied or were mistakes. His unemployment exacerbated his \ntragedies.  Circumstances beyond his control adversely affected his finances, and he \nacted reasonably and responsibly to address his delinquent debts. He has carried his \nburden of proof.    \n\n7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

He provided sufficient documentation to establish future financial \nproblems are unlikely. National security eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented June 8, 2017.  \n02/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on November 5, 2018, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted its file of relevant material (FORM) on December 3, 2018. Applicant received it \non January 2, 2019. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. The \nFORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant submitted his response to the FORM (Response) within the time period allotted. \nItems 1 through 6 and Applicant\u2019s Response are admitted into the record. The case was \nassigned to me on February 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with clarifications. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and married. He has two adult stepdaughters, who reside \nwith him and his wife. Applicant has worked for his current employer since 2016. He is \nindebted to three creditors for over $24,000 in delinquent debt as listed in the SOR. (Item \n5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial difficulties to being laid off in May 2010. He \npresented documentation that showed at the time of the layoff, he earned $174,292 \nannually. When he found a new job, his salary decreased to $74,115 annually. \nAdditionally, at the time he was laid off, he was repaying a loan he had received from his \n401(K) account. After the layoff, he could not repay that loan, and incurred a $40,000 \nFederal tax debt as a result of the loan being converted to an early withdrawal. He had \nan installment agreement with the IRS and has paid off that debt in full. He also \ndocumented that he had two other debts at the time of his layoff that he fully resolved. \n(Item 3; Answer; Response.) He indicated: \n \nBetween 2012 and 2016 I concurrently setup various payment plans with \ncreditors and have eliminated all but this debt from that time period. I could \nonly pay back a set number of creditors at one time. (Answer.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to a property management firm in the amount of $4,388, as \nalleged in \u00b6 1.a. Applicant admitted this debt, but contests its validity. It became \ndelinquent in 2016. Due to safety concerns with property management maintenance \npersonnel, Applicant vacated this property prior to his lease expiration date. At the time \nof his move, Applicant owed one month\u2019s rent, which he paid in April 2017. The remainder \nis for property damage, which Applicant was unwilling to pay because he felt it was \ncaused by the maintenance personnel. His November 2018 credit report reflects that he \ndisputed this debt. Applicant explained that he has contacted this creditor numerous times \nsince 2017 through letters and phone calls, to arrange a settlement with this creditor. He \nhas yet to receive a response. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Response.)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a credit union account placed for collection in the amount \nof $17,130, as alleged in \u00b6 1.b. This was for a loan Applicant took in 2010 prior to being \nlaid off. It was placed for collections in 2011. After his layoff, he could no longer afford to \nmake payments on the loan. In his Answer, he indicated he was willing to establish a \npayment arrangement with this creditor. However, in his Response, he claimed this debt \n\u201chas also been removed from the credit reports.\u201d He produced no further documentation \nto explain the reason it no longer appears on the credit report. This debt is unresolved. \n(Item 3; Item 6; Answer; Response.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a medical account in the amount of $2,927, as alleged in \n\u00b6 1.c. In his security clearance application, Applicant indicated that he formally contested \nthis debt through the credit reporting agencies. He noted that it does not appear on his \n2018 credit report. (Item 3; Item 6; Response.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent credit report, dated November 2018, reflects only one \ncollection account (the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a). He is current on his vehicle loan, \ncredit card account, student loan, and retail store credit cards. There are no new \ndelinquencies. (Response.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n& 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant had over $24,000 in debt, which became delinquent after he was laid off \nin 2010. There is sufficient evidence to establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c). \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s salary was reduced by more than half in 2010 as a result of being laid \noff. He has been addressing multiple unalleged accounts responsibly, albeit slowly, since \nthen. However, he could only afford to address a few debts at a time, due to his decrease \nin income and his large Federal tax debt. Applicant successfully disputed SOR \u00b6 1.c and \nit was removed from his credit report. While SOR \u00b6 1.a remains unresolved, he attempted \nto formally dispute the account. When the debt was not removed after filing the dispute, \nhe contacted the creditor to arrange payments. The creditor has not been responsive to \nhis multiple efforts to establish payment arrangements. I find that he has attempted to \naddress this debt responsibly, despite his inability to resolve it. However, while the debt \nidentified in SOR \u00b6 1.b no longer appears on Applicant\u2019s credit report, it has not been \nresolved.  \n \n \nDespite the unresolved status of SOR \u00b6 1.b, it is unlikely the Applicant will have \nfuture financial problems. From a close review of his 2018 credit reports, it appears that \nApplicant has learned how to live within his means on a modified income. His past debts \nwere due to factors largely beyond his control, and he now lives within his means. He has \ndemonstrated a track record of responsibly addressing multiple unalleged accounts. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20 (a) and (b) provide mitigation. AG \u00b6 20(e) provides mitigation to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with his \nefforts to resolve his debts as funds would allow, since being laid off in 2010. He is current \non his vehicle loan, credit card account, student loan, and retail store credit cards. There \nare no new delinquencies. While he has not resolved all of the debt on the SOR, he has \ndemonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nNational security eligibility is granted. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJennifer I.

The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for him. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n2 \n \nApplicant initially responded to the SOR allegations on November 8, 2018. He re-\ndrafted his response on November 14, 2018, at the request of the DOD CAF. He requested \na hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). His case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. On March 18, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for April 9, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, six Government exhibits (GEs 1-6) were admitted in evidence. Eight \nApplicant exhibits (AEs A-H) were admitted in evidence, and Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on April 19, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n  \n  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 19, 2018, Applicant was \n$129 past due on a student loan with a $2,184 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he was $71 past \ndue on a student loan with a $1,212 balance (SOR \u00b6 1,b); that he owed a charged-off \nstudent loan of $50,607 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he owed student loans of $2,357 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nand $1,308 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) in collection; and that he owed an unpaid credit-card judgment \ndebt of $1,304 from January 2012 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). When he responded to the SOR allegations \non November 14, 2018, Applicant denied that he was delinquent on his student loans.

The other student loan, ending in x8643, does not appear on his credit reports. Applicant admitted \nthat he obtained two large student loans from the lender. (Tr. 42.) \n  \n3 Applicant indicated that he had four Stafford student loans (three subsidized and one unsubsidized). (Tr. 24.) \nHe presented documentation of three Stafford student loans under the same account ending in #4034. His \nloan documentation shows a \u201c1-01 Stafford-Subsidized\u201d student loan for $2,315 in August 2007 with a balance \nof $2,188 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a \u201c1-04 Stafford-Subsidized\u201d loan of $2,315 obtained in August 2007 paid by the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.d in September 2011; and a \u201c1-03 Stafford-Unsubsidized\u201d loan obtained in August 2007 for \n$1,185 that was paid by the lender in SOR \u00b6 1.e in September 2011. (AE B.) Department Counsel indicated at \nApplicant\u2019s hearing that the federal loans in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \u00b6 1.b are respectively duplicated in SOR \u00b6 1.d and \n\n3 \n \nloans. Applicant struggled academically, and he withdrew from the college after one year. \n(GE 2.) \n \nApplicant moved home and was unemployed until April 2009, when he began \nworking in a temporary job for a marine supply company. On October 15, 2009, a judgment \nof $2,090 (judgment #1, not alleged) was entered against Applicant for credit-card debt he \nincurred while in college. Applicant had forgotten about the account after he moved. In \nApril 2010, he was hired into a permanent position as a warehouse technician. (GEs 1-2.) \nWith his father\u2019s assistance, Applicant began repaying his student loans. In January 2011, \nhe moved into an apartment. (GE 2.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s father became ill in early 2011 and passed away in July 2011.  (GE 2; Tr. \n39.) Applicant could not afford his student-loan payments on his own. In September 2011, \nthe creditor identified in SOR \u00b6 1.c charged off one of his private loans for $50,607 and \ntransferred two Stafford loans to the guarantor identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e with \nbalances of $2,616 and $1,452. (GEs 2-4; AE B.) \n \nApplicant moved back home to help his mother in January 2012. (Tr. 39.) His \nemployment income was approximately $400 a week. (GE 2.) In late January 2012, a \ndefault judgment for $1,304 (judgment #2, SOR \u00b6 1.f) was entered against Applicant for \ncredit-card debt incurred in college. (GE 5; Tr. 20.) \n \nIn August 2013, Applicant began a new job as a technician for a chemical company. \nHe earned approximately $500 a week, and he made some payments on his student loans \nin 2015. Applicant had some difficulties with his managers, and he was terminated in May \n2016 for the stated reason that he was not a good fit for the job. The company eventually \nagreed to pay him a settlement of $3,500, for violating his human rights in return for him \nnot disclosing the settlement terms.4 (GE 2; Tr. 73.) A production manager provided an \nemployment reference for Applicant in his search for a new job. (Tr. 38.) He attested that \nApplicant always took care to complete his work assignments quickly and accurately. \nApplicant had a positive attitude and worked well with his co-workers. He was a reliable \nresource in the production department. (AE G.) \n \nApplicant collected unemployment compensation of $350 a week from \napproximately May 2016 to March 2017. He attended an advanced manufacturing sheet-\nmetal program at a community college from July 2016 to December 2016 and otherwise \n                                                                                                                                                             \n1.e as they have the same account numbers. The creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e was the guarantor for the \nStafford loans, which are all listed under the same account number by the lender. (AE B.) Applicant testified \nthat two of the Stafford loans were listed as paid only because they were passed on to the guarantor. (Tr. 25.) \nHe now thinks that the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are back with the lender and are the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. (Tr. 55.) Applicant\u2019s May 2018 credit report does not list the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e (GE 4), so \nthey may be the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, or they may be the federal loans paid through garnishment in \n2017, as detailed in GE 2. The evidence falls short of substantiating that he owes the additional debt balances \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. \n \n4 Applicant testified that he was paid the settlement in January 2016. (Tr. 73.) However, according to his SF \n86, he was terminated in May 2016 (GE 1), so it is likely that he received the settlement in January 2017. \n\n4 \n \nspent his time looking for work, helping out at home, and engaging in recreational activities. \n(GE 2; AE E.) After he finished the first semester of the program at the community college, \nhe received a job offer from a defense contractor to become a semi-skilled sheet metal \nmechanic in its apprenticeship program. (Tr. 32. 70.) \n \nWith his application for that employment, Applicant completed and certified to the \naccuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on December 23, \n2016. Applicant responded affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he was currently \ndelinquent on any federal debt and disclosed that he owed student-loan debts of \napproximately $80,000. (GE 1.) \n \nApplicant was granted an interim secret clearance in mid-March 2017, and he began \nworking for the defense contractor in late March 2017. (GE 2; Tr. 33, 35-37.) Available \ncredit information revealed that Applicant was in default on the private student loan in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c with an accrued balance of $69,260. The federal student loans acquired by the \nguarantor in September 2011 were in collection for $2,357 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and $1,308 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). Applicant had a credit card account with a $2,341 balance ($41 over its reported \ncredit limit) that he was repaying according to its terms. Neither judgment debt #1 nor \njudgment debt #2 was on his credit record. (GE 3.) \n \nIn May 2017, the creditor executed a wage garnishment order to collect judgment \ndebt #1. Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished at $135 every paycheck from June 2017 to \nOctober 2017 to satisfy the debt. In June 2017, the U.S. Department of Education obtained \na garnishment order to collect $3,822 in defaulted federal student-loan debt, which \nApplicant indicated in April 2018 were the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. (GE 2.) \n \nAs of June 2017, Applicant owed $119,719 on his two private student loans, \nincluding the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.c. A collection entity offered to settle both loans for only \n$14,661. Applicant could not afford the lump-sum payment, and the loan balances \ncontinued to accrue. (Tr. 44.) In September 2017, the collection entity offered to settle his \nthen $120,969 total balance for $13,195. Applicant could not afford that payment. (GE 6.) \n \n \nOn April 5, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). He indicated that his student loans were no \nlonger delinquent, but that he had yet to establish a repayment plan to avoid further \ndelinquency. He stated that his wages were being garnished at $100 a paycheck to repay \ntwo of his federal student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). He indicated that he had paid $5 a \nmonth from March 2017 to November 2017 to rehabilitate a student loan. He could not \nthen recall which one, although at his hearing he testified that he had rehabilitated the \nloans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, which were returned to the lender as shown in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. (Tr. 55.) As for his financial matters generally, Applicant\u2019s take-home income was \n$460 per week after the garnishment for his student loans. His monthly expenses were \n$400 to his mother for household needs; $100 for gasoline; $275 in repayment of a car \nloan; $150 for cellphone service; $300 for groceries; $100 for alcohol; and $200 for \ncigarettes. Applicant was unable to recall the details of his student loans, but he planned to \ngather his financial paperwork for the OPM investigator. (GE 2.) \n\n5 \n \n \nOn April 6, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator. Applicant \nprovided tax records showing he had made some student loan payments in 2015 and \n2017; a settlement letter for his private student loans (SOR \u00b6 1.c and an unalleged loan \nwith a $25,479 principal balance); garnishment paperwork showing $1,296 had been taken \nfrom his pay toward his federal loans; and documentation of his satisfaction of judgment #1 \nin October 2017 through wage attachment. Applicant expressed an intention to eventually \nsatisfy his delinquencies. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAs of April 2018, Applicant was past due $129 on a federal student loan with a \n$2,184 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $71 past due on a federal student loan with a $1,212 \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The private student loan that had been charged off for $50,607 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c) had been removed from his credit report (GE 4), although it had not been satisfied. \nApplicant had retained the services of a law firm to clean up his credit record, and the law \nfirm successfully had that loan removed from his credit record. (AE D.) \n \n \nOn May 11, 2018, Applicant began making $100 weekly student-loan payments. \nBeginning on August 17, 2018, he lowered his weekly payment to $50. With limited \nexception, he made his weekly payments on time. His payments were applied to the \ninterest owed on his loans. (AE C; Tr. 20, 28, 51.) The transaction record of his account as \nreported by the lender does not identify the loan or loans to which his payments were \napplied, although a resolution agreement for his private student loans with the lender \nsuggests that the payments went toward his private student loans.5 (AE C.) \n \n \nOn April 6, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator. Applicant \nprovided tax records showing he had made some student loan payments in 2015 and \n2017; a settlement letter for his private student loans (SOR \u00b6 1.c and an unalleged loan \nwith a $25,479 principal balance); garnishment paperwork showing $1,296 had been taken \nfrom his pay toward his federal loans; and documentation of his satisfaction of judgment #1 \nin October 2017 through wage attachment. Applicant expressed an intention to eventually \nsatisfy his delinquencies. (GE 2.) \n \n \nAs of April 2018, Applicant was past due $129 on a federal student loan with a \n$2,184 balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $71 past due on a federal student loan with a $1,212 \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.b). The private student loan that had been charged off for $50,607 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c) had been removed from his credit report (GE 4), although it had not been satisfied. \nApplicant had retained the services of a law firm to clean up his credit record, and the law \nfirm successfully had that loan removed from his credit record. (AE D.) \n \n \nOn May 11, 2018, Applicant began making $100 weekly student-loan payments. \nBeginning on August 17, 2018, he lowered his weekly payment to $50. With limited \n                                                 \n5 The same lender holds the private student loans and his outstanding Stafford federal loans. The payments \nwere applied to the account number ending in x4034. (AE C.) However, the resolution agreement for his \nprivate student loans shows that he had paid $1,900 toward the student loans before entering into the \nresolution agreement (AE A), and the payments credited to the account ending in x4034 totaled $1,924, \ninclusive of fees. (AE C.)  \n \n\n6 \n \nexception, he made his weekly payments on time. His payments were applied to the \ninterest owed on his loans. (AE C; Tr. 20, 28, 51.) The transaction record of his account as \nreported by the lender does not identify the loan or loans to which his payments were \napplied, although a resolution agreement for his private student loans with the lender \nsuggests that the payments went toward his private student loans.6 (AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant earned between $500 and $600 a week in his defense-contractor job. (Tr. \n38-39.) As of May 2018, he was current on a car loan obtained in November 2017 for \n$15,897 being repaid at $275 per month. He was also making timely payments on a credit-\ncard account opened in February 2015. His account had a $2,549 balance. (GE 4.) He \nprovided no evidence of an unexpected circumstance that could explain or justify why he \nwas over two months behind on his federal student loans with scheduled terms of $33 and \n$17 a month (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b). (GE 4.) \n \n \nIn September 2018, Applicant applied for two open entry-level positions at his \nemployment toward becoming either an electrical draftsman or a structural/arrangements \ndraftsman. He was selected for interviews that never took place. (AE F.) On October 19, \n2018, the DOD CAF issued the SOR to Applicant because of his delinquent student loans \nand the unpaid judgment for $1,304 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). His interim clearance was withdrawn, and \nhe was walked off the job.7 (Tr. 30, 33.) He received his last paycheck in late October 2017 \nand had no income for about a month until he began receiving unemployment \ncompensation of $360 a week in December 2018. (Tr. 38-39, 45-48, 56, 61.) \n \n \nAs of November 2018, Applicant\u2019s federal student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a had a $2,198 \nbalance with a scheduled repayment at $33.67 per month for 81 months. (AE B.) The \nbalance of the loan in SOR \u00b6 1.b was approximately $1,200. Applicant believes that the \nfederal student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e are no longer owed; that they were either paid \nor are the same loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 55.) Applicant testified that he \nhad been repaying both loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) together at $68 a month. He admitted \nbeing \u201ca little late\u201d on his payment as of his hearing for his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 51-53.) \n \n \nOn November 5, 2018, Applicant entered into a resolution agreement for his private \nstudent loans (SOR \u00b6 1.c, balance $74,594, and unalleged loan balance $53,201, after \nhaving paid $1,900 toward the loans).  A collection entity agreed to settle both loans for \nonly $10,966 and to accept installment payments. (AE A.) Under the terms of the \nsettlement, Applicant was required to pay $200 a month from November 30, 2018, through \nAugust 30, 2022. (AE A), with interest on the loans continuing to accrue until the settlement \namount is satisfied. Applicant was advised that should he miss a payment, any amounts \npaid under the settlement would not be counted toward the debt. Applicant paid $250 in \n                                                 \n6 The same lender holds the private student loans and his outstanding Stafford federal loans. The payments \nwere applied to the account number ending in x4034. (AE C.) However, the resolution agreement for his \nprivate student loans shows that he had paid $1,900 toward the student loans before entering into the \nresolution agreement (AE A), and the payments credited to the account ending in x4034 totaled $1,924, \ninclusive of fees. (AE C.)  \n \n7 Applicant is apparently subject to recall by the defense contractor if his clearance should be adjudicated \nfavorably. \n\n7 \n \nDecember 2018. He has not made any payments since January 2019. He contacted the \ncollection entity and was advised that his loans had been transferred again. As of April \n2019, he was awaiting word from the new entity whether the settlement offer was still valid. \n(AE H; Tr. 45-50.) \n \n \nAs of April 2019, Applicant had made no payments on the $1,304 credit-card \njudgment (SOR \u00b6 1.f). Sometime after he answered the SOR, Applicant contacted the \ncollection attorney, and promised that he would make weekly payments once he returns to \nwork. (Tr. 53-55.) \n \n \nApplicant stopped paying his mother rent of $400 a month when he became \nunemployed in October 2018. He pays $50 to $60 of their cellphone costs. He also pays \nhis car loan at $275 per month, car insurance at $112 per month, and his grocery \nexpenses. He was paying $68 a month toward his student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \n(Tr. 58-59.) Applicant received an income tax refund of \u201ca little under $1,000\u201d for tax year \n2018 that gave him a financial cushion while unemployed. (Tr. 60-61.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \n\n8 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The concern under Guideline F is \nbroader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an individual\u2019s self-\ncontrol, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified information. \n \n \nAfter his father passed away in 2011, Applicant defaulted on his private and federal \nstudent loans obtained in 2007 for study at a for-profit university. A private student loan \nwas charged off for $50,607 in September 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He also stopped paying on a \nprivate student loan, obtained for $25,479, which was not included in the SOR.8 As of \n                                                 \n8 In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in \nwhich conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating: \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3. \n\n9 \n \nFebruary 2017, two federal student loans were in collection for $2,357 and $1,308 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d and 1.e). In June 2017, the U.S. Department of Education obtained an order to garnish \nApplicant\u2019s wages to recover some $3,822 in delinquent federal student loans. It is unclear \nwhether the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e were paid through that garnishment from his \nwages in 2017 or were returned to the original creditor and are the Stafford loans in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, as Applicant now believes. His credit record shows that, as of April 2018, \nthe Stafford loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were delinquent with balances of $2,184 and \n$1,212. The evidence falls short of establishing that Applicant owed the delinquencies in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e as of the issuance of the SOR in October 2018. \n \n \nAvailable information substantiates a record of delinquency on two credit-card \naccounts, although only one debt was alleged (SOR \u00b6 1.f). An unalleged October 2009 \njudgment for $2,090 was repaid by wage garnishment from June 2017 to October 2017. A \nJanuary 2012 judgment for $1,304 (SOR \u00b6 1.f) is still outstanding. Applicant\u2019s record of \ndelinquent accounts triggers disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and (c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nFive of the seven mitigating conditions warrant some consideration and could potentially \napply in whole or in part. They are: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \nIn this case, Applicant\u2019s unalleged private student-loan debt will not be considered as a basis for \ndisqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). However, his unalleged debt remains relevant in assessing \nmitigation and the likelihood of him making timely payments on his student loans going forward. \n\n10 \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(a), the debt obligations in the SOR first became seriously past \ndue in 2011. However, a debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered \nrecent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of \nconduct and, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. \n15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Despite recent efforts to rehabilitate his federal \nstudent loans, and his $1,900 paid toward his private student loans between May 2018 and \nNovember 2018, AG \u00b6 20(a) cannot fully apply. Applicant has not made any payments \ntoward his private student loans since January 2019, and he has made no payments \ntoward the January 2012 credit-card judgment debt.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has some applicability in that Applicant has had periods of \nunemployment and underemployment, and his ability to repay his student loans was \nnegatively impacted by his father\u2019s death in September 2011. He had counted on his father \nto help him with his student-loan payments, and his income was insufficient to make the \nrequired payments on his own. Even if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in \nwhole or in part, due to circumstances outside of her control, I have to consider whether \nApplicant acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with his financial difficulties. See \nISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4, n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR \nCase No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether Applicant \nmaintained contact with her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence in that regard is mixed. He was employed at an income of \napproximately $500 a week from August 2013 to May 2016. He made some student-loan \npayments in 2015, although the amounts and timing of his payments are not in evidence. \nThere is no evidence that he made any student-loan payments from May 2016 to March \n2017, when he was unemployed and collecting an unemployment benefit at $350 a week. \nHe apparently rehabilitated some student loans after he began working for a defense \ncontractor in March 2017, but those payments were only $5 a month. As of April 2018, he \nwas $129 and $71 past due on the federal student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, \nrespectively, without any apparent explanation or justification. It was not until May 2018, \nafter his OPM interviews, that he began a concerted, consistent effort to address his \nstudent loans by paying $100 a week. Even so, he showed some responsibly by taking \nsteps to address his student loans before the SOR was issued. He has been unable to \nmeet the terms of a settlement for his private student loans since January 2019 because \nhe lost his employment income. Applicant has not displayed similar initiative toward \nresolving his credit-card default judgment debt (SOR \u00b6 1.f), however. As of his response to \nthe SOR in November 2018, he did not know enough about the judgment to either confirm \nor deny the debt. As of his April 2019 hearing, he had spoken with the law firm collecting \n\n11 \n \nthe judgment debt. He did not provide the date of the contact, but it may reasonably be \ninferred that it post-dated his receipt of the SOR. Applicant\u2019s failure to keep himself \nupdated about the status of his credit card account is not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) has some applicability because $1,206 was garnished from his pay in \n2017 in partial satisfaction of his federal student-loan debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are \nimplicated because Applicant made consistent payments toward his private student loans \nfrom May 2018 to January 2019. He testified that he had been making $68 payments \ntoward the federal student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b until very recently, although he \npresented no corroborating documentation. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies only in that the evidence \nfalls short of establishing the additional delinquency in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e as of the \nissuance of the SOR in October 2018. \n \n  \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off \nevery debt in the SOR. He is required to demonstrate that he has established a plan to \nresolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to implement the plan. See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant\u2019s track record of student-loan payments from May 2018 to \nJanuary 2019 suggests that he would have taken full advantage of the opportunity to settle \nhis $127,795 private student-loan balance for $10,966, payable in $200 monthly \ninstallments from November 30, 2018, through August 30, 2022, if he had not lost his \nemployment income. Student loans are an investment in one\u2019s future and do not carry the \nsame judgment concerns as a record of irresponsible spending or overreliance on \nconsumer credit cards. He has a record of timely payments on his open credit card and his \ncar loan. In that regard, he has shown that he can manage some expenses responsibly, \nprovided he has the income to do so. \n \n \nAt the same time, it is difficult to conclude when, or even if, he will alleviate the \nsecurity significant financial burden of approximately $130,000 in outstanding student \nloans. His employment income was certainly adequate enough for him to meet the minimal \nmonthly repayments required for the federal loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and yet both \nloans were a few months past due as of April 2018. As of April 2019, he was not making \nany payments toward more than $127,000 in private student-loan debt, and he was again \nlate in making his $68 monthly payments toward his federal student loans. He was waiting \nto hear whether the resolution agreement for his private student loans would be honored by \na new collection entity. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). The analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s situation is not unlike that of many students of his generation who take \n\n12 \n \nout loans for their college education expecting to land a job at some future date that will \njustify taking on such debt. Yet Applicant did not help himself by attending a pricy for-profit \ninstitution, struggling academically, and then withdrawing from school without any degree, \ncertificate, or credential. He was fortunate in gaining employment with a defense contractor \nin March 2017 that provided him an income to begin repaying his student loans. With his \nwages garnished in 2017 to repay some of his federal student-loan debt and a 2009 credit-\ncard judgment debt, he was not in a position to take advantage of offers to settle his private \nstudent loans on terms very advantageous to him in June 2017 and in September 2017. \nHe is credited with making consistent student-loan payments starting in May 2018, after his \nOPM interviews. The Appeal Board recently reaffirmed that an applicant who begins to \nresolve his debts only after being placed on notice that his clearance was in jeopardy \u201cmay \nbe disinclined to follow rules and regulations when [his] personal interests are not at stake.\u201d \nSee ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 16-\n03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018)). \n \nIn exceptional cases, an administrative judge may grant initial or continued eligibility \nfor a security clearance, despite the presence of an issue(s) that can be partially but not \ncompletely mitigated.9 Applicant\u2019s recent failure to comply with the debt resolution \nagreement without some evidence that the current assignee will accept affordable \ninstallment payments causes a considerable level of uncertainty about his financial \nsituation. Some concerns persist about his financial judgment because of his delinquency \non his federal student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in the spring of 2018, when his income \nshould have supported timely repayment. He was spending $300 a month on discretionary \nitems when he was behind on his student loans. Based on the evidence before me, it \nwould be premature to conclude that his financial problems are sufficiently resolved to \nwhere they no longer present a security risk. \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the financial reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a security \nclearance in the future. After applying the disqualifying and mitigating conditions to the \nevidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant at this time. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n                                                 \n9 Appendix C of Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4 grants DOHA administrative judges the \ndiscretionary authority to grant initial or continued eligibility for a security clearance despite the presence of an \nissue(s) that can be partially but not completely mitigated with the provision of additional security measures. \nSee also Memorandum, Director for Defense Intelligence (Intelligence and Security), dated January 12, 2018 \n(\u201cAppendix C identifies authorized exceptions that are to be utilized when making adjudicative decisions to \ngrant initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position . . . \nEffective immediately, authority to grant clearance eligibility with one of the exceptions enumerated in \nAppendix C is granted to any adjudicative, hearing, or appeal official or entity now authorized to grant \nclearance eligibility when they have jurisdiction to render the eligibility determination.\u201d) \n \n\n13 \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

The SOR further informed \nApplicant that, based on information available to the government, DoD adjudicators \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 29, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. (Answer.) The case was assigned to me on January 24, \n2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing \nthat same date on January 24, 2019, scheduling the hearing for February 12, 2019. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through \n6, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf. Applicant \npresented two documents, which I marked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AppXs) A and B, and \nwere admitted into evidence. The record was left open until March 12, 2019, for receipt \n\n \n2 \n \nof additional documentation.

(AppXs E~G.) \n \n  Guideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. The state sales tax lien, in the amount of $1,000, was paid and released by \nthe state in June of 2018, four months prior to the issuance of the SOR, as evidenced \nby documents from the state. (TR at page 17 line 17 to page 21 line 13.) This allegation \nis found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.b.~ 1.e. Allegations 1.b. and 1.c., and 1.d. and 1.e., are two and the same state \nsales tax liens, filed in two different counties, totaling about $16,101. Pursuant to a \nFebruary 2015 payment plan, Applicant has reduced this tax lien to $6,553.41, as \nevidenced by documents from the state. (TR at page 21 line 13 to page 25 line 12, \nAnswer, and AppX D.) These allegations are found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.f. Applicant has paid a $1,434 business related judgment, as evidenced by \ndocumentation from Creditor F. (TR at page 26 line 9 to page 27 line 13, and AppX A.) \nThis allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.g. In November of 2018, Applicant \u201cpaid in full\u201d the alleged $167 debt to \nCreditor G, as evidenced by documentation from Creditor G. (TR at page 27 line 14 to \npage 28 line 1, and AppX C.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.h. and 1.j. These are one and the same debt to Creditor H in the amount of \nabout $1,295. In November of 2018, the \u201ccurrent balance on this account . . . [was noted \nas] $0.00,\u201d as evidenced by documentation from Creditor H. (TR at page 28 lines 7~25, \nand Answer 3 pages from the last page.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n \n \n1.i. In December of 2016, Applicant paid the alleged $50 debt to Creditor I, as \nevidenced by documentation from Creditor I. (TR at page 29 lines 1~13, and Answer the \npenultimate page.) This allegation is found for Applicant. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n  \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness, particularly state sales tax liens. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n\n \n5 \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s past financial difficulties were, for the most part, directly related to a \nfailed business. He has addressed all of the alleged past-due debts; and in the case of \nthe sales tax liens, prior to the issuance of the SOR. Applicant has thus demonstrated \nthat future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been \nestablished. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant is well respected in the \nworkplace. (AppXs E~G.) I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.j.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.
