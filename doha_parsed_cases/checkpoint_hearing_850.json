The case was heard on January 18, 2023. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) of the hearing on January 25, 2023. \nDepartment Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2, which were \nadmitted without objection. She also provided a Request for Administrative Notice (AN), \nwhich is discussed below. Applicant testified and offered two emails as exhibits, which I \nmarked together as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. The record \nclosed at the conclusion of the hearing. (Tr. at 11-14, 52-54.) \nProcedural Ruling \nDepartment Counsel requested in its AN that I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran). She provided an eight-page summary \nof those facts, supported by 18 U.S. Government documents pertaining to Iran. The \ndocuments provide elaboration and context for the factual summary set forth in the AN. I \ntake administrative notice of certain facts included in the Government documents \nattached to AN. These facts are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to \nreasonable dispute. They are set forth in the Findings of Fact, below. (Tr. at 14-16; AN.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant was born in the United States in 1956. His parents, now deceased, were \nIranian citizens working in the U.S. as part of a technology-exchange program between \nthe Iranian Government and the United States before the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \nApplicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran due to his birth in the United States and his \nparents\u2019 Iranian citizenships. He lived in the U.S. until age six, when his family moved \nback to Iran in 1962. He lived there until he graduated from high school. He returned to \nthe United States for his higher education and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1979, a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1980, and a doctoral degree in 1986. As a young man, he received a \nmedical exemption from performing mandatory military service in Iran. He has worked for \n40 years in the United States and Europe and asserts that his professional \u201creputation is \nvery well established.\u201d Applicant held a DoD secret clearance in the 1980s. He presently \nworks for a DoD contractor as an engineer and is seeking eligibility for a clearance in \nrelation to his employment. (Tr. at 9-10, 17, 19-27, 39-40, 57-58; GE 1, Sections 2, 9, 12, \n17, 18, 25.) \nApplicant\u2019s parents became naturalized U.S. citizens before they returned to Iran \nwith Applicant and his three sisters in 1962. His father was a railroad locomotive expert. \nHe came to the United States in 1952 as an employee of the Iranian Ministry of \nTransportation and Railroads to research ways to improve the Iranian railroad system. \nHe and his family returned to Iran because he was laid off at his job at a U.S. research \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacility. Applicant\u2019s parents returned to live in the United States in 1978, one year before \nthe revolution in Iran. They lived in the U.S. the remainder of their lives. His three sisters \nalso continued their adult lives in the United States. (Tr. at 19-27.) \nApplicant has been married twice. In 1987, he married an Iranian-born woman, \nwho is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran. They divorced in 2018. They have two \nadult children. Applicant remarried another Iranian-born woman in 2019. She is a citizen \nof Iran and lives with Applicant in the United States. She is a U.S. lawful permanent \nresident (LPR). She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she has met the residency \nrequirement in 2024. Her father is deceased. At the time Applicant submitted the e-QIP, \nhis mother-in-law was alive, but she passed away in September 2022. His wife has three \nbrothers and a sister who are Iranian citizens and residents. Her family are part of a small, \nminority religious group in Iran. She speaks with her sister and one of her brothers by \nphone with some frequency. Applicant\u2019s wife works in the United States as a mathematics \nteacher at a private school. (Tr. at 33-39, 41-43; GE 1 at Sections 17, 18; AE A.) \nApplicant has travelled to Iran several times during his adult life, including a \nnumber of times after the Iranian Revolution. He traveled frequently to Iran to visit his \nfuture second wife before they married in 2019 and until she received her visa to enter \nthe United States as his wife in 2021. He uses his Iranian passport to enter Iran because \nthat is a requirement of the Iranian Government. Now that his mother-in-law has died, he \nno longer has any reason to return to Iran. If his wife returns to Iran to visit with her \nsiblings, Applicant claims that he has no reason to travel with her. Applicant\u2019s last trip to \nIran was in April 2021 to escort his second wife to the United States following her receipt \nof her LPR status. He did not travel to Iran to attend the funeral services for his mother-\nin-law in 2022. Applicant stated that, from his prior experience as a clearance holder, he \nunderstands the foreign travel procedures and the importance of compliance with those \nsecurity procedures in the event he travels anywhere outside the United States. (Tr. at \n29-33, 44-45, 55.) \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAt the hearing, Applicant responded to the following allegations in the SOR: \n1.a: Applicant\u2019s Wife. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Iran. As of 2021, she has \nrelocated to be with Applicant in the United States and is a lawful permanent resident in \nthe U.S. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she Is eligible to do so in 2024. \n1.b: Applicant\u2019s Mother-in-Law. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law died a few months prior \nto the hearing.

Shia \nclergy and political leaders vetted by the clergy dominate key power structures in the \ncountry. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader is the head of state and holds constitutional authority \nover the judiciary, government-run media, and other important institutions. \nThe U.S. Department of State advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to the \nrisk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. Since 1984, Iran \nhas been designated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. Its support of \nterrorist organizations throughout the Middle East creates instability in the region. Iran \nthreatens U.S. persons directly and through proxy attacks, particularly in the Middle East. \nIran\u2019s growing expertise and willingness to conduct aggressive cyber operations \nmake it a major threat to U.S. and allied networks and data. As of 2018, all previously \nsuspended sanctions imposed on Iran were reinstated with the goals of permanently \npreventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, ceasing Iran\u2019s development of ballistic \nmissiles, and ending Iran\u2019s broad range of malign activities. \nThe U.S. Department of State has identified significant human rights issues in Iran. \nThe issues include the unlawful and arbitrary killings by the Iranian Government or its \nagents; forced disappearances attributed to the government; torture and inhumane \ntreatment by the government and its agents; the imprisonment of political opponents; \nsevere restrictions on free expression and the media; serious restrictions on political \nparticipation; and government corruption. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B sets forth nine conditions in AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case. The following three conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \nI note that the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign \ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one \nrelative is a citizen of a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \nThe evidence is sufficient to establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions \nand shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 8 provides six \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns under Guideline B. The following two \nconditions have possible application in this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions apply in this case. The nature of Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his wife, who legally resides with him in the United States, renders it \nunlikely that he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of \nhis wife or the Iranian Government and the interests of the United States. Moreover, there \nis no conflict of interest because Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the Iranian Government \nand country is so minimal and because he has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest. Based upon an overall view of the facts of this case and the \nmitigating conditions, Applicant has established mitigation of security concerns under \nGuideline B. SOR paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has provided evidence \nof his strong ties to the United States, starting with his U.S. birth and citizenship. His \nmarriage to an Iranian citizen raises concerns about the potential for foreign influence, \nbut that concern has been mitigated by his wife\u2019s relocation to the United States and her \ncurrent status as an LPR. As noted, the recent death of his mother-in-law has eliminated \nthe security concerns raised by her Iranian citizenship and residency.

Applicant\u2019s nearly lifelong presence in the United States \nmitigates the potential for a conflict of interest due to his wife\u2019s relationships with her \nsiblings in Iran. I have also weighed the risks presented by Applicant\u2019s past travel to Iran. \nI view his testimony as highly credible that he has no reason to continue to travel to Iran \nin the future.

She has a daughter, age 27, and three minor children between the \nages of 17 and 13. She received her cosmetology license for management and business \nin May 2012. In 2022, she earned an associate degree in cybersecurity. (Tr. 87-92; GE \n1; AE F) \nApplicant has been employed as a protective agent for a government contractor \nsince November 2020. She was issued an interim security clearance, but she lost her job \nin September 2022 after her interim security clearance was revoked with the issuance of \nthe SOR. She earned over $28 an hour for this position. She recently started employment \nas a certified nursing assistant earning $20 an hour. Applicant would like to receive her \nDOD security clearance so that she can resume her employment with the government \ncontractor. (Tr. 87-92, 103; GE 1; AE F) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant created significant debt due, in part, to her ignorance of business and \nfinancial practices. She does not believe she is responsible for the SOR debts because \nof her lack of knowledge, and her claim that these creditors took advantage of her and \nwere dishonest in their business transactions. Her financial problems worsened after she \nlost her employment in about September 2022. (Tr. 95-102; SOR response) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,335.

In the SOR \nresponse, Applicant stated that she does not owe any money to this insurance creditor, \nand that these are false allegations. During the hearing, she testified that she had opened \nan account with this creditor, and they sent her a piece of equipment to install in her son\u2019s \ncar. She was unable to install the equipment. She thought the account for $118 was for \nthe equipment she returned to the insurance company, although the return was admittedly \nlate. She provided photos of the equipment and the mail receipt for the returned \nequipment. She also provided a screen shot from the creditor acknowledging the \nequipment was received. Applicant said the information from the insurance company was \nconfusing. She called them multiple times to have them explain why she owed any money, \nbut the insurance creditor could not provide any information. She has not paid any money \nto either of these delinquent accounts. (Tr. 25-42, GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5, AE B) \nThe credit reports in the record show that SOR \u00b6 1.a is a duplicate account for \nSOR \u00b6 1.e since they have the same account numbers. Based on the most recent credit \nreport, the insurance account has an outstanding balance of $35. Applicant has \nreasonably disputed this $35 debt. (Tr. 25-42, GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5, AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off car loan account in the amount of $10,208. The \nFebruary 2023 credit report showed that the account was opened in February 2019, and \nApril 2020 was the date of \u201cmajor first delinquency reported.\u201d Applicant denied this debt \nin her SOR response and claimed it was a false allegation. She provided a September \n2021 statement that she received pre-approval from the car loan creditor for financing. \nShe initially wanted to purchase a Lexus when she went to the dealership, but she ended \nup buying a Mitsubishi instead. She testified that she had been at the dealership all day \nand signed the paperwork to purchase the Mitsubishi car. She was unhappy with this \nvehicle and called the car-loan creditor. She was advised to return the car back to the \ndealership if she did not like it. It is unclear how long she had possession of the car, but \nat the minimum, she had the car for a week. On July 12, 2019, she called the dealership \nand reported the conversation she had with the car loan creditor. The next day she \nvoluntarily returned the car to the dealership. She reported this information to the car loan \ncreditor, who in turn told her that she had nothing to worry about and that she did not owe \nany money for the returned Mitsubishi car. The February 2023 credit report showed that \nApplicant had disputed this account with the car loan creditor, but after information was \nprovided to the credit agency, the account was taken out of dispute status. Applicant did \nnot provide supporting documentation to show that she is not liable for this delinquent \naccount. For example, she did not provide correspondence sent to the creditor or credit \nreporting company explaining why she believed she was not responsible for this debt. \nThis debt remains unresolved. (SOR response, Tr. 49-66, 93-97; GE 2 page 5, GE 3, GE \n5; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a car loan creditor account for a repossessed car with an \noutstanding deficiency balance of $29,692. In May 2019, Applicant stated that she had \npurchased a Ford vehicle, but due to the pandemic, she lost her employment in March \n2020. She called the car loan creditor to report her unemployment and to see if the \ncreditor would work with her on a payment plan.

Applicant testified that the \ncreditor was dishonest, and she is not liable for this delinquent account. She did not \nprovide sufficient supporting documentation, and this debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 66-\n80, 95; SOR response, GE 2, GE 5; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent account with a bottled water supplier that was \nreferred for collection in the amount of $232. During the hearing, Applicant stated that this \naccount was opened in about July 2020 at a retail store for a water bottle delivery service \nfor her residential water cooler. After four bottles of water were delivered, she called the \nwater supplier and told them that her equipment was incompatible and their water bottles \nwould not work with her cooler. The water supplier told her to leave the bottled water \noutside of her residence and they would pick it up. They automatically charged her credit \ncard approximately $150 for this service. She did not understand why the water supplier \naccount showed an outstanding balance of $232. She had called the creditor on several \noccasions, but no one was able to respond to her questions. Applicant\u2019s supporting \ndocumentation submitted to demonstrate that she is not responsible for the unpaid $232 \ndebt was insufficient and unpersuasive. For example, she did not provide correspondence \nsent to the creditor or credit reporting company explaining why she believed she was not \nresponsible for this debt. This debt remains unresolved. (SOR response, Tr. 42-49, 92; \nGE 3) \nDuring the hearing Applicant discussed delinquent accounts that were listed on \nher February 2023 credit report. These delinquent accounts were not included in the \nSOR. She did not know why her credit report showed a delinquent account with an \ninsurance creditor in the amount of $167, but she did admit that she had business \ndealings with this company. She also had two delinquent credit card accounts totaling \n$303. In July 2022, she had another credit card account that was charged off in the \namount of $665. She stated that she is aware of these credit card accounts and has \ncontacted the creditors about her employment and financial issues. She stated that some \nof the SOR debts she was unaware of until she received the SOR in September 2022. \nShe admitted that she was aware of the two largest SOR debts when she completed her \ninterrogatory in September 2021.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nThe credit reports in evidence reflect five delinquent debts and Applicant\u2019s \nresponsibility for the debts she denied. The record establishes the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,  was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant admitted a certain amount of \nfinancial ignorance, which caused her to develop two significant SOR debts from the \npurchase and return of two vehicles. Her loss of her employment in September 2022 also \ncontributed to her financial problems. Applicant signed contracts with different \nbusinesses, but she failed to comply with the terms of these contracts. She became aware \nof her two largest debts in at least September 2021, a full year before she lost her \ngovernment contractor employment. At the time of the hearing, she still had not taken any \naction beyond telephone calls to the creditors to resolve her delinquent accounts. She \nclaimed that she is not responsible for these SOR debts due to her lack of business \nknowledge and the deceptive business practices of her creditors. A degree of ignorance \nto one's financial situation may suggest an indifference to the proper satisfaction of legal \nobligations. After September 2021, her knowledge about the two largest debts at issue \ncan no longer be attributed to unawareness, but rather a lack of due diligence. Her failure \nto take more aggressive actions to resolve her legal obligations creates a security concern \nabout her reliability and her willingness to follow laws, rules, and regulations. \nThere are circumstances beyond an individual\u2019s control that can adversely affect \ntheir personal finances. However, to receive full credit for this mitigating condition, an \napplicant must show that he or she acted responsibly under the circumstances. In this \ninstance, Applicant failed to demonstrate that she acted responsibly since she did not \ntake more aggressive actions to document the disputes of her delinquent debts.

Given the lack of supporting evidence and the \ndevelopment of new debt, I am unable to find that her financial issues are unlikely to recur. \nShe has not established a track record of financial responsibility. Under all of these \ncircumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant developed delinquent debt before she lost employment in September \n2022, and there is no track record of steady, systematic payments over an extended \nperiod of time. She has not taken responsibility for the debts she created, and if she did \nnot fully understand the significance of signing a legally binding business contract, then \nshe should have sought advice from a family member, friend, or attorney. Her inability to \nfully understand business transactions is not a valid excuse. She did not show that the \npurchase of the two vehicles involved complicated contracts or payment plans. Her \nactions demonstrate a lack of financial responsibility and good judgment, and raise \nunmitigated questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of her past-due debt, and a track record \nof behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

Applicant admitted that, during \nthis time, he held a security clearance with his previous employer, a defense contractor. \nHowever, Applicant claimed that the contractor had a \u201claid-back environment\u201d and he \ndid not recall ever being briefed about drug use or being required to take a urinalysis. \n(Item 5) \nHowever, Applicant stated that shortly after starting with his current employer, \nthat employer\u2019s security officer told him that he could not use marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant claimed that he was \u201csurprised\u201d to learn that marijuana \nremained illegal under federal law, which, in his view, \u201ccontradicted\u201d state law. He \nclaimed that he never used marijuana in high school or college because it was illegal \nand he had since only used in states where it was legal. Applicant asserted he would \nnot have used marijuana if it was illegal for him to do so. He claimed that he had no \nintent of using marijuana in the future. (Item 5) \nIn his June 2022 Response to DOHA Interrogatories, Applicant detailed that he \nused marijuana weekly from April 2020 through May 2020 and again from May 2021 \nthrough August 2021. After he passed his August 2021 drug test, Applicant increased \nhis marijuana use to every other day until he stopped in October 2021. (Item 5) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \u201cI used marijuana in places it was \nlegalized \u2026 and didn\u2019t realize I was breaking this guideline since it was only illegal at \nthe federal level. I have stopped using marijuana since my security officer warned me \nabout this guideline and I don\u2019t plan on using it in the future.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM or otherwise offer any \nmitigating evidence beyond what he had previously stated. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). The current National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, 2017, after the 2014 DNI memo was \nissued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The \nmemo incorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) \namong various other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency. \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (citing Guideline H, alleged in this case, \nand the AGs for personal conduct and criminal conduct, Guidelines E and J, not alleged \nin this case). Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not determinative, to \nadjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a \nsensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nApplicant submitted his first SCA in 2019, and his clearance was subsequently \ngranted. He began using marijuana on a weekly basis from April 2020 through May \n2020 and again from May 2021 through August 2021. After he passed his August 2021 \ndrug test, he used marijuana every other day until October 2021, when he submitted his \nmost recent SCA. By his own admission, his marijuana use occurred either while \ngranted access to classified information or while holding a sensitive position. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(f) both apply. \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was both \nrecent and frequent. He initially used marijuana in April and May 2020, but stopped \nwhen it made him feel paranoid. However, a year later he resumed using marijuana \nweekly. This use occurred while he was granted access to classified information. \nAn applicant's use of illegal drugs after having completed a security clearance \napplication or after otherwise having been placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug \nabuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her judgment, reliability, \nand willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). It has long been held that ignorance or mistake \nof law is generally not an excuse for failing to abide by legal obligations. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-00540 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2019). \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant ever sought clarification from \nhis first employer regarding the company\u2019s drug policies or the potential ramifications of \nhis marijuana use while holding a security clearance. Instead, in August 2021, he \nstopped using marijuana just long enough to pass a drug test for his current employer. \nThis circumstance strongly suggests that, in doing so, Applicant had at least a minimal \nunderstanding that ongoing drug use could negatively affect his employment. Yet, he \nresumed using marijuana anyway and at a greater frequency. Applicant\u2019s continued use \nof marijuana, even after the drug test, leaves me with concerns regarding his ability to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant disclosed his past drug involvement and stated he no longer intends on \nusing marijuana. These are steps to be considered in weighing mitigation. However, \nparticularly given that he used marijuana after filling out an SCA and after being drug \ntested, I find that insufficient time has passed to show that his security significant \nconduct is behind him. The circumstances and extent of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use \npreclude full application of either AG \u00b6 26(a) or AG \u00b6 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not request a hearing, nor did he respond to the FORM. In so \ndoing, he did not provide any additional evidence in explanation or mitigation beyond his \nanswer, and I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Overall, the \nfrequency, recency and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to his suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 22, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 24, 2022, and he submitted \nsupplemental answers to the SOR on August 30, 2022; October 17, 2022; and October \n20, 2022. (Item 1) He elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a \nhearing. The Government\u2019s written case was submitted on October 31, 2022.

Applicant received the FORM and responded on \nNovember 29, 2022 (FORM Response). The case was assigned to me on January 18, \n2023. \nThe Government exhibits identified as Items 1 through 3, and Applicant\u2019s FORM \nResponse, are admitted in evidence without objection. Department Counsel requested \nthat I take administrative notice of certain facts about Ethiopia. The request, included in \nthe record as Item 4, is not admitted in evidence, but I have taken administrative notice \nof the facts contained therein, as summarized in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b. He is 52 \nyears old. He was born in Ethiopia, where he obtained an associate degree in 1990 and \nhe married his first spouse in 2004. He emigrated to the United States in 2008, became \na naturalized U.S. citizen in 2013, and was issued a U.S. passport in 2014. He divorced \nhis first spouse in 2014, remarried in Ethiopia in 2015, and divorced in 2021. (Items 1-3; \nFORM Response) \nAs of his July 2022 response to interrogatories, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend since \napproximately 2015 is a 36-year-old, Ethiopian-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, with \nwhom he has three minor children. He previously owned a home in the United States \nfrom 2010 to 2014, and he has lived with his sister and her spouse since 2018. He has \nvolunteered as a priest at his church. He has worked as a part-time bus driver for \ncounty public schools since February 2018. He also worked as a bus driver for his \nemployer, a DOD contractor, since December 2018. He has never held a security \nclearance. (Items 1-3; FORM Response) \nApplicant\u2019s father and mother are deceased. His 54-year-old brother, his 49-year\u00ad\nold sister-in-law, and their 4-year-old child are citizens and residents of Ethiopia. His \nbrother works as a salesman and is not affiliated with a foreign government or military. \nApplicant has weekly contact with his brother. After the birth of his brother\u2019s child, \nApplicant sent his brother $150 to $200 two to three times as a gift. He traveled to \nEthiopia in 2015 and 2017 to visit his then-spouse, and he again traveled there in 2018 \nto visit his father. He used his U.S. passport to travel there. He saw his brother and his \nbrother\u2019s family during each of these trips. He has not since traveled to Ethiopia. (Items \n2-3) \nApplicant\u2019s 48-year-old sister, born in Ethiopia, is a U.S. citizen and resident. \nShe is also a bus driver for county public schools. As noted above, Applicant lives with \nher and her spouse, and he contributes to their rent. Applicant expects to marry his \ngirlfriend and the mother of his children. She previously worked at a beauty salon but \nwas unemployed as of his response to interrogatories. He provides her with financial \nsupport of $1,000 monthly.

He \ndid not disclose, in response to Section 18 of his SCA that inquired about relatives, \ninformation about his brother in Ethiopia. The report of Applicant\u2019s October 20, 2020, \nbackground interview reflects that after the background investigator (BI) asked Applicant \nto verify information about his parents and then-parents-in-law, BI asked Applicant if he \nhad any other relatives that he was required to list on his SCA, and Applicant indicated \nthat he did not. The report reflects that BI asked if Applicant\u2019s negative response meant \nthat it was just Applicant and his sister, and Applicant responded in the affirmative. The \nreport reflects that after BI verified information about Applicant\u2019s listed foreign contact, \nwhich was his then-spouse, BI asked Applicant if he had any other foreign contacts and \nApplicant disclosed his brother in Ethiopia. He then disclosed information about his \nbrother and his brother\u2019s family in Ethiopia during the remainder of that background \ninterview. He continued to disclose such information during four subsequent interviews \nin October 2020 and November 2020, as well as in his response to interrogatories, \nAnswer, and FORM Response. (Items 1-3; Form Response) \nApplicant maintained that he did not intentionally falsify his SCA or his October \n20, 2020, background interview by failing to disclose information about his brother in \nEthiopia. He indicated that he did not list his brother on his SCA because he found the \nSCA confusing, as he did not understand what foreign contacts meant, and he was \nfocused on disclosing his family in the United States. He also indicated that he was \nunder time restraints, and he did not have his brother\u2019s contact information. He stated \nthat his omission was a misunderstanding. (Items 1-3; Form Response) \nEthiopia \nEthiopia\u2019s constitution provides for an ethnic-based federal system of \ngovernment. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed leads the Prosperity Party, which controls the \ngovernment. On October 4, 2021, newly elected members of parliament took their \nseats. The elections took place against a backdrop of grave instability, including inter-\nethnic and inter-communal violence and an electoral process that was not free or fair \nfor all citizens, although observers assessed the result generally reflected the will of \nmost citizens. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Ethiopia is at \u201cLevel 3: \nReconsider Travel,\u201d due to armed conflict, civil unrest, communications disruptions, \ncrime, and the potential for terrorism and kidnapping in border areas. It advises against \ntravel to the Tigray region and border with Eritrea due to armed conflict; the Amhara \nRegion due to armed conflict and civil unrest; the Afar Region due to armed conflict \nand civil unrest; the border area with Somalia due to potential for terrorism, kidnapping, \nand landmines; border areas with Sudan and South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, \ncivil unrest, and ongoing clashes between various armed groups; border areas with \nKenya due to potential for terrorism and ethnically motivated violence; and the Wollega \nZones of the Oromia Region due to violence and civil unrest. The U.S. Department of \nState has assessed Addis Ababa as being a \u201cCRITICAL\u201d threat location for crime \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe continuing threat of al-Shabaab (AS) and ISIS emanating from Somalia is \nEthiopia\u2019s core terrorism concern and the focal point of its security apparatus and the \nEthiopian National Defense Force\u2019s counterterrorism efforts. In late 2020, Ethiopian \nsecurity officials announced the arrest of AS and ISIS members accused of planning \nattacks in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia. Terrorist organizations continue to \nplan terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens, Western targets, and interests in East \nAfrica. \nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) noted that the \nconflict in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region since November 2020 has worsened humanitarian \nconditions and resulted in at least 2.1 million internally displaced persons. The ongoing \nconflict has also led to refugees fleeing to neighboring countries, which could \ndestabilize the region resulting in additional migrants seeking travel to Europe. The \nODNI assessed that in 2022, East Africa will see new bouts of conflict in the coming \nyear as the region becomes increasingly strained by the civil war in Ethiopia and other \nregional conflicts. \nThe U.S. Department of State reported that the most significant human rights \nissues in Ethiopia included: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings \nby the government; forced disappearance by the government; torture and cases of \ncruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government; harsh and \nlife-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; political prisoners or \ndetainees; serious abuses in a conflict, including reportedly unlawful or widespread \ncivilian harm, enforced disappearances or abductions, torture and physical abuses or \npunishments; reports of unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers by militia groups; \nserious restrictions on free expression and media, including violence or threats of \nviolence against journalists, unjustified arrests of journalists, censorship, and the \nexistence of criminal libel and slander laws; serious restrictions on internet freedoms; \nsubstantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly; serious government \ncorruption; lack of investigation and accountability for gender-based violence; \ntrafficking in persons; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting \nmembers of racial or ethnic minority groups; and the existence or use of laws \ncriminalizing same-sex sexual conduct. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. Applicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are \nEthiopian citizens residing in Ethiopia. The U.S. Department of State travel advisory for \nEthiopia is at \u201cLevel 3: Reconsider Travel,\u201d due to armed conflict, civil unrest, \ncommunications disruptions, crime, and the potential for terrorism and kidnapping in \nborder areas. Applicant has weekly contact with his brother in Ethiopia, and Applicant \nsaw his brother and his brother\u2019s family when he traveled to Ethiopia in 2015, 2017, and \n2018. His family in Ethiopia creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion.

Although Applicant has not traveled to Ethiopia since 2018, he \nmaintains weekly contact with his brother and his brother\u2019s family there. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not \nestablished. Applicant complied with reporting requirements, to include reporting his \nbrother during his background interviews, response to interrogatories, Answer, and \nFORM Response. AG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2008. He is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen and holds a U.S. passport, which he used to travel to Ethiopia during his trips \nthere. His girlfriend since 2015, whom he intends to marry, is also a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen, and she is the mother of their three children. He provides her with financial \nsupport of $1,000 monthly. He lives with his sister and her spouse, and he contributes to \ntheir rent. He has worked as a part-time bus driver for county public schools and as a \nbus driver for his employer since 2018. He also volunteers as a priest for his church. \nApplicant met his burden to demonstrate that he would resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

He continued to disclose such information in \nsubsequent interviews, in his response to interrogatories, his Answer, and his FORM \nResponse. He explained that he found the SCA confusing, and he was focused on \ndisclosing his family in the United States. He maintained that he did not intentionally \nfalsify his SCA or information during his background interview, and that the omission of \nhis brother in Ethiopia was a misunderstanding. I find that he did not deliberately falsify \nhis response to section 18 of his SCA, and he did not deliberately falsify information \nduring his October 20, 2022, interview. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B and Guideline E and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant did \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nnot deliberately falsify his security clearance application or information during his \ninterview with a background investigator, and he mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his foreign connections.

He acknowledged SOR \u00b6 1.b as an \nequipment return charge. He attributed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.n to a third party for which he \nhad cosigned the accounts and asserted that he was \u201ctrying to communicate with the \nother party to get it figured out.\u201d He attributed SOR \u00b6 1.g to missing a payment and then \nforgetting about it. He attributed SOR \u00b6 1.h to being unable to afford the monthly payment \nand asserted that he made payment arrangements to resolve it. He maintained that he \nwas not aware of the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m. Without proffering any \ncorroborating documents, he asserted that he was trying to settle SOR \u00b6 1.b and that \nnone of the medical debts appeared on a credit report he reviewed. He provided a \ndocument confirming that he negotiated a settlement agreement on March 7, 2022, to \nrepay $3,551 to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.h via 24 monthly payments of $148, beginning April 1, \n2022.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant did not meet his burden to establish that his debts were largely \nattributable to his periods of unemployment or other circumstances beyond his control.  \nHe also failed to proffer evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he acted responsibly to \naddress his debts or to establish any of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), \nor (e). He did not proffer a basis to support his denial of SOR \u00b6 1.n. He did not substantiate \nhis dispute of the medical debts in \u00b6 1.d, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m or provide other evidence that \nhe has taken action to resolve the issue. He is credited with negotiating a payment \narrangement to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.h and working overtime hours. However, he did not \ncorroborate any payments he made or otherwise demonstrate meaningful progress in \nresolving his debts. He opened six new credit accounts between May 2020 and June \n2022, one of which is in delinquent status. I am unable to conclude that his finances are \nunder control and unlikely to recur. Accordingly, I have doubts about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He became delinquent on these accounts \nbecause his first wife took advantage of his granting her a power of attorney while he \nwas deployed, his divorces, the theft of one of his motorcycles, and the high cost of \nliving where he was stationed in the military.

(Tr. 42-78, 165-174; Answer; GE 1, \n3-6, 10, 11; AE A) \nIn August 2008, while he was serving in the Army and deployed abroad, \nApplicant\u2019s command found that he had created a toxic work environment for his \nsubordinates. His command disciplined him with an Article 15 under the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ). He forfeited part of his pay, and he had to serve extra duty. \nHis command also disqualified him for the Good Conduct Medal for that deployment. He \nclaimed that this discipline resulted from a personality clash with one of his leaders who \nApplicant believes created the toxic work environment. He also claimed that an Article \n15 is not a serious punishment because it is non-judicial, is often used for \u201cminor \nconduct issues,\u201d and that the Army requires the destruction of Article 15 documentation \nno more than two years after the punishment is imposed. He also provided positive \ncharacter reference letters from soldiers who served with him on this deployment. (Tr. \n78-81, 174-181; Answer; GE 3; AE B) \nIn April 2012, Applicant inappropriately certified an Army Physical Fitness Score \nCard (APFSC). Despite knowing he was required to witness a soldier\u2019s physical fitness \ntest to sign an APFSC, he signed one of his subordinate soldier\u2019s APFSC without \nwitnessing the fitness test. When his command learned that the soldier had, in fact, \nfailed his physical fitness test, Applicant was disciplined under Article 15 of the UCMJ \nfor a violation of Article 107. He claimed that he signed the APFSC as a favor to the \nsoldier, who he trusted, based upon that soldier\u2019s misrepresentations to him and the \nsoldier\u2019s past physical fitness test results. When he signed the APFSC, he claimed he \ndid not know that the contents on the card were inaccurate. However, he acknowledged \nthat he should not have signed it without witnessing the soldier\u2019s physical fitness test. \nHe was reducted in rank, forfeited part of his pay for two months, and ordered to \nperform extra duty.

Applicant \nclaimed that he did not get along with either COL B or MSG C and both may have had \nulterior motives with respect to their role. For example, Applicant had been sent to \nreplace MSG C, but MSG C stayed, creating an uncomfortable work environment where \nMSG C saw Applicant as a rival. Applicant claimed that MSG C coached and pressured \nwitnesses, thus unfairly biasing the resulting investigation and findings. However, he \ndoes not claim that COL A had any ulterior motives or was biased towards him. (Tr. 97-\n102, 106-110, 184-202, 226-228; Answer; GE 3, 7-9) \nThe AR 15-6 investigation revealed that, while many cadets had no issues with \nApplicant\u2019s behavior towards them, several female ROTC cadets at the college were \nmade to feel uncomfortable by comments he made about their appearance and the \nmanner in which he said them. At least one of these cadets said his comments made \nher sick to her stomach. Several claimed that they avoided him based upon how \nuncomfortable he made them feel. The investigating officer found that Applicant had not \nengaged in actions that could be considered sexual harassment, but that Applicant did \nengage in inappropriate and unprofessional conduct. However, COL A disagreed and \nfound that Applicant had engaged in sexual harassment towards female cadets. (Tr. \n113-118, 184-202, 206-211; Answer; GE 3, 8) \nIn April 2019, Applicant signed a developmental counseling form acknowledging \nthat he was being counseled for inappropriate behavior towards cadets. He further \nacknowledged that he was being removed as a cadet instructor and that he was not \npermitted to be alone with female cadets until further notice. I find this action constitutes \nhim being \u201cdisciplined for misconduct.\u201d He certified a statement from the summary of \none of his security interviews that he also received a Letter of Reprimand (LOR), but he \nlater testified that he did not receive an official LOR. After COL A made his findings after \nthe conclusion of the AR 15-6 investigation, Applicant had an opportunity to appeal \nthose findings. He did not appeal because the result of not appealing was that the Army \nwould reassign him to another role, which is what he desired. After waiving his appeal, \nhe was removed from his role at the college because he could no longer hold a special \ntrust authority role. However, he also testified that he was not formally disciplined, and \nthat he was permitted to be around cadets unsupervised after the AR 15 investigation \nconcluded if it was incidental to tasks he was assigned. However, the action removing \nhim as a cadet supervisor and the order prohibiting his interaction with female cadets \nunsupervised was never formally lifted. Despite these actions and the sexual \nharassment finding, COL B sent Applicant to supervise ROTC cadets at a six-week \ntraining course during the summer of 2019, because MSG C did not want to attend. \nApplicant claims that this fact tends to show that COL B and MSG C knew that the AR \n15-6 investigation findings were unfounded.

In the 2019 Memo, among other things, he wrote that the May 2019 sexual \nharassment finding was the \u201conly allegation of misconduct during my entire military \ncareer.\u201d Immediately after this sentence, he more specifically stated that he had never \nbeen the recipient of an Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention \n(SHARP) complaint. Therefore, in the 2019 Memo, he claimed that he had not had any \nother allegations of misconduct and he had never had a SHARP complaint. This \nstatement that he had no other allegations of misconduct was inaccurate, as the Army \ndisciplined him for misconduct in 2008 and 2012, as referenced herein. He claimed that \nhe mistakenly wrote this sentence and meant to write that he had not been disciplined \nbefore or after in the context of a SHARP allegation. However, he specifically made that \nstatement in the next sentence, which would have made the first sentence superfluous if \nhe truly was limiting the scope to the SHARP context. He claimed that he is a poor \nwriter and the words he wrote are not what he meant. He also asserted that he did not \nintend to mislead or deceive by making this statement and that he assumed that his \nArmy records were readily available to the DOD CAF. (Tr. 141-147, 179, 202-204; \nAnswer; GE 3, 9) \nWith respect to his role as an ROTC cadet supervisor, Applicant certified that he \nhad not received a written warning and had not been disciplined for misconduct in the \nworkplace in the last seven years on his certified Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing dated December 14, 2021 (2021 SF 86). He was required to \ndivulge this information as a result of the 2019 sexual harassment finding and the \ndiscipline for misconduct he received of not being permitted to interact with female \ncadets, and his subsequent removal from his post. He claimed that he did not divulge \nthis information because he had not been formally disciplined or suspended as a result \nof the AR 15-6 investigation. He also claimed that he misread the plain meaning of the \nquestions in the 2021 SF 86 and thought that he was only required to divulge security \nviolations. Finally, he assumed that his Army records were readily available to those \nmaking decisions about his security clearance eligibility. He claimed that he never \nmeant to hide information, or to mislead or deceive when he failed to divulge this \ninformation. He did not volunteer this discipline or suspension before the DOD \ninvestigator confronted him with it during his January 2022 security interview. During a \nfollow-up interview with another DOD investigator in April 2022, Applicant was \nforthcoming with information regarding the 2019 AR 15-6 investigation. (Tr. 135-141, \n204-217; Answer; GE 1, 3, 7, 8) \nAuthorized DOD investigators interviewed Applicant on January 14, 2022, \nJanuary 18, 2022, and April 6, 2022. These investigators drafted summaries of the \ninterviews they conducted with him. The investigator who drafted the summary from the \nJanuary 28, 2022 interview wrote that Applicant told him that Applicant did not have any \ndisciplinary issues before or after he was a supervisor of ROTC cadets. On August 14, \n2022, he certified, in writing, that he made this statement to the investigator. He \nappended to this certification over 250 pages of additional documents. Therefore, it is \nhard to believe that he rushed through this certification or did not provide it the attention \nit deserved.

Despite certifying other similar statements \nabout his lack of Army discipline in his interview summaries, he claimed that the \ninvestigators either misquoted him or he misunderstood the scope of their questions. He \nalso claimed that he made mistakes by not clarifying or appending some of the \nstatements from his security interviews that he certified. (Tr. 147-162, 179, 213-217; \nAnswer; GE 3) \nApplicant cited to the fact that he disclosed the aforementioned 2012 UCMJ \nArticle 15 discipline in his March 20, 2017 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (2017 SF 86) as evidence that he was not trying to hide his prior Army \ndiscipline. He also claimed that he thought anyone making a decision regarding his \nsecurity clearance eligibility would have access to his military records, so he assumed \nthat anything he did not disclose would be readily available. He provided a plethora of \npositive whole-person evidence in the form of character-reference letters, his testimony, \nthe testimony of one of his friends who is also a former Army colleague and superior, \nand his almost exclusively positive Army performance evaluations. The individual who \ntestified at hearing on Applicant\u2019s behalf felt so strongly about Applicant\u2019s character that \nhe paid for an airline ticket and flew to the hearing from out of state. Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter evidence, that at least 36 individuals provided, reflects that he is honest, \nreliable, hard-working, of good moral character, and loves his country. Many of those \nwho provided character references are current or former servicemembers and some \nhold security clearances. Some were ROTC cadets under Applicant\u2019s supervision. \nNearly all these individuals opined that they believe Applicant should keep his security \nclearance.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had five delinquent debts totaling approximately $49,000. Several of \nthese debts were delinquent for many years. The above-referenced disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by divorce, underemployment, and the \ntheft of his motorcycle. These conditions were largely beyond his control. By engaging \nthe services of the DCC, regularly paying into the fund that the DCC uses to settle his \ndebts, and satisfying several SOR and other debts, all before the SOR was issued, \nApplicant has shown that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. Through \nthese efforts, he has also shown that he initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) fully apply. He has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2008, 2012, and 2019, while he was serving in the Army, Applicant engaged in \ninstances of workplace misconduct for which he was disciplined.

The 2019 incident resulted in a finding \nthat he had engaged in sexual harassment. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for why he omitted or misstated his disciplinary \ninformation strain credulity. He was clearly disciplined for misconduct by his superior \nofficer while he was supervising ROTC cadets in 2019. The plain meaning of the \nquestion in the 2021 SF 86 required him to report this discipline. \nI also find it difficult to believe that both he (in the 2019 Memo) and the DOD \ninvestigator mistakenly reported the same information (no discipline before or after the \n2019 incident) regarding his lack of disciplinary actions. I also find it hard to believe that \nApplicant failed to include any reference that his broad statements about his lack of \ndiscipline before or after the 2019 incident were limited to the SHARP context. In fact, in \nthe 2019 Memo he made separate claims about not having any disciplinary actions and \nnot having any SHARP allegations. He also clearly expended significant time and effort \non certifying the security interviews where he adopted the false information. \nI acknowledge that he included information in the 2017 SF 86 related to his 2012 \nmisconduct, but that fact cuts both for and against him. It shows that he was willing to \ndivulge this derogatory information, but it also shows that he understood that he should \ninclude disciplinary actions within seven years on his security questionnaire. It also \nshows that he understood that these reporting requirements were not limited to security \nincidents. For these reasons, I find that he deliberately omitted relevant facts from the \n2021 SF 86. I also find that he deliberately provided false information concerning \nrelevant facts to investigators and security officials. All the above-referenced Guideline \nE disqualifying conditions are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s 2008, 2012, and 2019 conduct that resulted in his \ndiscipline, I find that, considering his lengthy military and other professional career, he \nengaged in this conduct infrequently enough that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. It has also been over four \nyears since he last engaged in conduct that resulted in discipline. Therefore, I find that \nhe has mitigated the security concerns related to his conduct resulting in those \ndisciplinary actions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c). \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he corrected his omission of \nrelevant facts in the 2021 SF 86 or falsifications in his 2019 Memo or security interviews \nbefore being confronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable. \nDeliberately omitting or providing false relevant information is not minor as it \nstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s omission, \nand his false statements were not infrequent, and they did not happen under unique \ncircumstances. Instead, he omitted relevant information or provided false information on \nat least three occasions. He has not provided sufficient evidence that the behavior is \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has undergone counseling. However, while I understand that he \nmaintains that his omission and falsifications were not deliberate, this continued reliance \nhas the unfortunate effect of meaning that he has not acknowledged his behavior. AG \u00b6 \n17(c) partially applies. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) has some applicability as well. Applicant\u2019s character reference letters \nand the testimony from his friend and former colleague show that others know about the \nallegations in the SOR, thus reducing his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. The fact that he eventually spoke at length about his omission and falsifications \nto the DOD investigator after being confronted also reduces this vulnerability. \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct and discipline that led to his omission and falsifications \nare supported by official records and, in many cases, by his own statements. While I \nunderstand that he claimed that some of the allegations of misconduct against him were \nfrom sources of questionable reliability, this belief does not excuse his omission or false \nstatements. AG \u00b6 17(f) is not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s honorable, high performing, and decorated military service. I \nconsidered the unwavering support that he enjoys among his friends, colleagues, and \npeers. However, I also considered that too often, Applicant asks me to believe his \nversion of events over official findings. He also asks me to make too many \nunreasonable leaps of faith about the intent behind his actions and his overly nuanced \njustifications for his omission and falsifications. Moreover, he asks me to disbelieve \nsome of his own written statements and certifications when they do not fit his narrative. \nConsidering the totality of the evidence and its context, I doubt the sincerity of his \nexplanations for not disclosing his conduct when required, and for making false \nstatements. There are simply too many instances of omitting relevant facts or providing \nfalse information and too many different, untimely, and illogical explanations for his \ndoing so. He has not provided sufficient mitigating evidence. It is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his eligibility for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d-2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

The Government exhibits included in the FORM (Items 1-11) are \nadmitted in evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has \nworked since November 2017. He received a high school diploma in 1995. He was \nmarried in 2002 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in 2010, but he separated from his \nsecond wife in 2015. He has two children, ages 19 and 16. He served on active duty \nwith the U.S. Air Force from 1997 to 2003 and received an honorable discharge but was \nseparated for an alcohol-treatment failure. (Items 2, 3) \nIn the SOR, under Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s eight \ndelinquent debts totaling about $78,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h). The largest of these \ndebts was a $66,000 child support delinquency listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The Government \nalso alleged that he misused his corporate credit card from September 2015 until March \n2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) Finally, it alleged that in July 2005, he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition that was discharged in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). In his response to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted these allegations except for SOR \u00b6 1.b, which he denied. He claimed \nthat he brought this account current in 2016 or 2017. The Guideline F SOR allegations \nIncluding SOR \u00b6 1.b, are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit \nreports produced by the Government. (Items 3, 7-11) \nApplicant provided no evidence concerning the resolution or attempted resolution \nof the SOR debts, except for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He claimed that he resolved \nthe child support delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.b by bringing the account current in 2016 or \n2017, but he provided no documents to corroborate this claim. The Government\u2019s 2018, \n2019, 2021, and 2022 credit reports reflect this account as an account in collections. \nThe 2022 credit report reflects a balance that is higher than that listed in the SOR. Any \nadverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as the increased balance associated \nwith the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b cannot be used for disqualification purposes, however \nit may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; in considering whether \nthe applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-\nperson concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He has \nneither resolved, nor is he in the process of resolving, any of the SOR debts. He \npresented no evidence to show he has participated in financial counseling or has a \nworking budget. He did not present evidence of his current financial situation. (Items 1, \n3, 8-11) \nApplicant failed to report any financial delinquencies on the Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in January 2018. He was required to \nreport the delinquency alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. During his November 2018 security \ninterview, he did not disclose this financial delinquency until the investigator confronted \nhim with it. He denied that he deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b because he believed that the debt was not delinquent and he therefore did not \nneed to disclose it.

(Items \n1, 3) \nFrom about September 2015 until about March 2016, Applicant misused his \nemployer-issued credit card by charging about $2,500 to it for personal housing \nexpenses. He claimed that he needed the money because of his separation from his \nspouse. He claimed that he promptly paid the money back through a loan from his \nretirement account. He claimed his employer did not discipline him for this misuse. He \nprovided no documentary evidence related to this incident. (Items 1-3) \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2005. The bankruptcy court \ngranted him a Chapter 7 discharge in November 2005. There is no evidence in the \nrecord as to the reason he filed bankruptcy or the amount of the debt that was \ndischarged. (Item 7) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2015 separation from his spouse \nand the financial burden of his child support payments. He claimed that he is paying \nabout $3,500 per month for child support, which is more than he earns. He claimed that \nhe is trying to have his ex-wife agree to a lower amount. He provided no documentary \nevidence of the amount of his monthly obligation, how much he earns per month, or any \nefforts to resolve the issue. (Items 1-3, 8-11) \nApplicant\u2019s estranged spouse alleged that in about November 2015, Applicant \nthreatened to harm her repeatedly over the telephone. She alleged that he hacked her \ne-mail account and sent sexually explicit photographs of her to her work colleagues and \nher lawyer. She also alleged that he posted sexually explicit photographs of her online. \nShe alleged that she feared for her safety because of Applicant\u2019s actions and \nstatements towards her. In December 2015, based upon these allegations, she filed a \npetition for injunction for protection against domestic violence against Applicant. On \nFebruary 24, 2016, a court awarded his estranged spouse a final judgment of injunction \nfor protection against domestic violence (\u201cprotection order\u201d or \u201cPO\u201d) against Applicant. \nApplicant was provided notice and an opportunity to be heard at the hearing, but he did \nnot attend. The court found that Applicant\u2019s estranged spouse had been a victim of \ndomestic violence or that she had reasonable cause to believe that she was in imminent \ndanger of becoming a victim of domestic violence by Applicant. In his response to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted sending an unspecified \u201ce-mail,\u201d but denied improperly \naccessing her e-mail account because they both had access to one another\u2019s accounts. \nHe also denied sending sexually explicit photographs of his estranged wife. (Items 1, 5) \nIn about June 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery against his \nthen-girlfriend (now estranged spouse). He was found guilty, sentenced to a month in \njail, placed on probation for a year, and was ordered to attend anger management \ncourses. He claimed that he has fulfilled all the requirements of his conviction. The \narrest and conviction resulted from him throwing a beer can at the victim that hit her in \nthe face. He also pushed her out of a chair. He had been drinking alcohol at the time. \nImmediately following this incident, she agreed to allow him to drive her to a hotel. \nHowever, while she was in the car, she became fearful of him again and jumped out of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe car while it was at a stoplight.

He \nbelieved that his license was suspended for his failure to pay child support obligations. \nHe was found guilty of this charge. He admitted to the conduct but claimed that he did \nnot realize that his license was suspended. In March 2011 he was charged with \nviolating the terms of his probation because of driving on a suspended license. He was \nfound guilty of violating the terms of his probation. In December 2011, he was again \ncharged with driving on a suspended license. (Items 1, 3, 4, 6) \nIn November 2010, Applicant was charged with violating the terms of his \nprobation when he tested positive for methamphetamine after taking a court-ordered \ndrug test. He claimed that he tested positive because he took some of his wife\u2019s \nprescription Adderall. He did not have a prescription for Adderall when he tested \npositive. He was found guilty of violating the terms of his probation. (Items 1, 3, 6) \nIn about September 2007, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI). The charges were ultimately dismissed after \nApplicant paid fines and attended court-ordered alcohol treatment classes. I consider \nhis payment of fines and attendance of treatment classes as an admission of the \nunderlying criminal conduct. (Items 1, 3, 6) \nIn about January 2004, Applicant was driving with an open container of alcohol in \nhis car. He was charged with a moving violation and pleaded guilty. He was required to \npay fines and he did so. (Items 1, 3) \nBetween about June and July 2002, Applicant attended command-directed \nalcohol counseling and treatment while he was in the military. These counseling \nsessions were about eight hours daily and lasted about four weeks. During this \ntreatment and counseling, he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Despite this treatment, \nhe was administratively separated from the Air Force in February 2003 for alcohol \nrehabilitation failure. (Items 1, 3) \nIn about May 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery against his \nfirst wife. He pleaded no contest and was placed on probation and required to pay fines. \nHe was also required to complete an anger management course. He and his ex-wife \nengaged in a physical confrontation when both had been consuming alcohol. Applicant \nhas fulfilled all the requirements that resulted from his pleading no contest. (Items 1, 3, \n5, 6) \nIn about April 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with disturbing the \npeace outside of a restaurant. He was making threats and appeared to be under the \ninfluence of alcohol. He pleaded no contest and paid required fines. As part of his \nsentence, he was ordered not to return to the restaurant.

(Item \n3) \nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s arrests and underlying \nconduct, the entry of the PO and underlying conduct, and his probation violations and \nunderlying conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.g). Under Guideline G, the Government \nalleged Applicant\u2019s 2002 alcohol counseling, his \u201calcohol abuse\u201d diagnosis, his \nseparation from the military for alcohol rehabilitation failure, and his 2004 citation for \ndriving with an open alcohol container (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.c). It also cross-alleged \nhis 2002 arrest for battery, his 2007 arrest for DUI, and his 2010 arrest for battery, along \nwith the underlying conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.d). Under Guideline E, the Government alleged \nthat Applicant falsified his SF 86 because he failed to list his delinquent child-support \naccount in it (SOR \u00b6 4.a). It also cross-alleged the delinquent child-support account, his \nmisuse of his employer-issued credit card, his arrests (and the underlying conduct), his \nprobation violations (and the underlying conduct), the entry of the PO (and the \nunderlying conduct), and it cross-alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.c (SOR \u00b6 4.b). (Item 1) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant had several delinquent debts totaling about $78,000. His child support \nbalance, which is the most significant of these debts, has been delinquent for several \nyears. Applicant misused his employer-issued credit card, which constitutes employee \nan intentional financial breach of trust. He needed bankruptcy protection in 2005, so he \nhad earlier financial difficulties. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIt has been about 17 years since Applicant filed bankruptcy and there is no \nevidence that he has filed again. I find that a bankruptcy filing is unlikely to recur and \nfind in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.j. It has been about seven years since \nhe misused his employer\u2019s credit card. He promptly paid back the money that was \nowed. I find that this behavior happened so long ago that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nI find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.i. \nThere is no documentary evidence in the record of payments to or payment \narrangements with creditors for the SOR debts. Applicant claimed that he brought the \nchild support account current in 2016 or 2017. This is a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the debt. However, he did not provide documents to substantiate the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndispute, such as proof of payment or an acknowledgement from the creditor that the \naccount was current. He did not provide evidence of actions he took to resolve the \ndispute. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2016). \nAs there is no documentary evidence to show that the SOR debts were resolved \nor appropriately disputed, I cannot find that Applicant has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Likewise, I cannot find that he has made a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. He has not provided evidence to show a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing and I \ncannot find that they are unlikely to recur. He has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has been charged with numerous criminal offenses. For most of these \noffenses there is sufficient evidence of criminal conduct, as he pleaded guilty or no \ncontest, the victim made a credible allegation against him, or there were police reports. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nWhile acknowledging the serious and violent nature of some of his criminal \nactions, it has been over seven years since Applicant engaged in criminal behavior. The \nsignificant amount of time that has elapsed is persuasive evidence of successful \nrehabilitation, that the criminal behavior is unlikely to recur, and that it no longer casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant drove while under the influence of alcohol and drove with an open \nalcohol container. While consuming alcohol, he breached the peace and engaged in \nphysical violence against his spouse. He was diagnosed with \u201calcohol abuse.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n22(a), AG \u00b6 22(c), and AG \u00b6 22(d) are established. AG \u00b6 22(e) and AG \u00b6 22(f) are not \nestablished. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant was advised to abstain \nfrom consuming alcohol. Therefore, there is no evidence that his current level of \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nconsuming one to two beers once or twice a week is inconsistent with treatment \nrecommendations. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \nIt has been about 12 years since Applicant has had an alcohol-related incident \nsuch as those described in AG \u00b6 22(a). This extended length of time without alcohol-\nrelated incidents provides sufficient evidence that Applicant no longer habitually \nconsumes alcohol or \u201cbinges\u201d on alcohol to the extent that it impairs his judgment. The \n12 years that has elapsed is persuasive evidence that his excessive alcohol \nconsumption is unlikely to recur, and that it no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The alcohol consumption security concerns are \nmitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government representative; and \n10 \n (b)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant claimed that he did not divulge his delinquent child support account in \nhis SF 86 or volunteer it during his security interview because he thought he brought the \naccount current in 2016 or 2017. He claimed he did not know the account was \ndelinquent or that he was required to report it. I find this explanation to be a reasonable \none. I also note that Applicant listed other derogatory financial information on his SF 86 \n(misuse of his employer-issued credit card). This action undermines the notion that \nApplicant was deliberately attempting to hide derogatory information. Given these \nconsiderations, I find that there is insufficient evidence that he deliberately provided \nfalse information or concealed or omitted relevant information. AG \u00b6 16(a) and AG \u00b6 \n16(b) are not established. \nApplicant has financial issues. He has committed criminal acts and alcohol was \nconsistently involved in his criminal and other negative incidents. He was diagnosed \nwith \u201calcohol abuse,\u201d and he was separated from the military because of failed alcohol \nrehabilitation. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are covered by Guideline F and are sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under Guideline F. Guideline E is not established with \nrespect to Applicant\u2019s financial issues. His criminal acts and alcohol-related issues, \nwhile covered by Guideline J and Guideline G, are not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under those guidelines. These issues support an assessment of \nquestionable judgment, unreliability, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, \nor other characteristics indicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. AG \u00b6 16(c) is raised by Applicant\u2019s criminal and alcohol-related \nconduct. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating condition potentially applies in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \n \nFor the reasons I included in my analysis of the Guideline J and Guideline G \nmitigating conditions, such as the passage of a significant amount of time without \nrecurrence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s criminal and alcohol-related conduct is unlikely to \nrecur. For these same reasons, I find that this behavior no longer casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are \nmitigated. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his honorable discharge. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns, but he did mitigate the criminal \nconduct, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. 6-7, 26-27, 46; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had nine delinquent student loans, in collection \nstatus, totaling approximately $40,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i) It also alleged that he failed to \nfile his 2017 to 2021 federal and state income tax returns, as required, (SOR \u00b6 1.j) \nApplicant admitted the nine delinquent student loans. He took out the student \nloans in the period of 2010 to 2014 when he attended art school. He further admitted \nthat he has not made any payments toward these debts. The reasons he gave for failing \nto pay toward the debts were that he believed his parents were paying these loans until \nhe had a falling out with them. He admitted not following up to set up his own payment \nprocess. The other reason he gave was that when he checked with a commercial credit \nreporting service, it indicated that the student loans had reverted back to the \ngovernment. He thought that meant he no longer was responsible to pay them. He did \nnot take any further action until he received the SOR when he contacted the \nDepartment of Education directly and found out about the delinquent status of his loans. \nDocumentation from his current student loan servicer showed that as of July 2023, his \nstudent loans were in excess of $51,000. (Tr. 28, 30-31; AE C) \nApplicant claimed that he set up a payment plan but that plan was put on hold \nbecause of the student loan relief legislation resulting from COVID-19. His credit report \nfrom February 2022, shows that all of his student loans were placed in collection status \nin 2017, years before the COVID-19 relief. He most recently was sent a notice by his \nstudent loan servicer telling him that his loan payments will resume in October 2023. He \ndid not provide any payment information after receiving this notice. His student loans \nremain unresolved. (Tr. 28; GE 3; AE D) \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 2017-2021 federal and state tax \nreturns.

He testified that he has not filed his 2022 federal or state tax returns \n(I will not use his 2022 tax information for disqualifying purposes, but I may use it in my \ncredibility, mitigation, and whole-person analyses). His unfiled tax return issues remain \nunresolved. (Tr. 27-28, 38-43; AE A-B) \nApplicant produced a character letter from a personal friend who is a special \nagent for another government agency. The friend believes Applicant is honest, \ndemonstrates integrity, and possesses the highest moral character. The letter does not \nstate whether the author is aware of the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s case. (AE E). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has delinquent student loans that remain unpaid. He also failed to \ntimely file his 2017-2021 federal and state income tax returns. I find all the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant claims he filed all his state and federal tax returns for 2017-2021, \nhowever, he failed to provide documentation corroborating that claim. Even giving him \nthe benefit of the doubt that he did file those returns, such filing did not occur until after \nAugust 2023, years after they were due. He ultimately sought the services of a tax \npreparation professional, but again not until after he received the SOR. Since his action \nwas only prompted by receiving the SOR, his reliability and trustworthiness are called \ninto question. Applicant failed to describe any conditions beyond his control as a reason \nfor not timely filing his tax returns. Neither of the mitigating circumstances apply. \nApplicant failed to pay, or act upon, his delinquent student loans until he received \nthe SOR. His loans were delinquent before they went into COVID-19 deferment status. \nAs of October 2023, they are once again in an active pay status and Applicant did not \ndocument any plans to pay these loans. He did not provide sufficient mitigation \nevidence to establish the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), or any other mitigating condition. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered favorable character \nevidence. However, Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Items 2, 9, 10) \nIn about April 2021, Applicant began dating a woman (girlfriend). After several \nmonths, he and his girlfriend began having problems with their relationship. In June \n2021, they had an argument and he grabbed her by her hair and attempted to pull her \ninto his car. In September 2021, he attempted to strangle her. His girlfriend did not file \ncriminal charges at the time these events occurred. (Items 2, 4-7, 9) \nIn late December 2021, Applicant was visiting his girlfriend from out of town \naround Christmastime. At some point during his visit, they began arguing. During the \nargument, he attempted to strangle her and threatened to \u201cslump\u201d her and her family. \nGiven the context, I find that he meant that he would physically harm her and her family. \nOn December 24, 2021, his girlfriend went to the local magistrate\u2019s office and had a \nprotective order (PO) issued against him. The PO prohibited him from having contact \nwith his girlfriend. While she was applying for the PO, he harassed her by calling her on \nher cell phone numerous times. (Items 2, 4, 6) \nEarly on December 25, 2021, when police attempted to serve Applicant with the \nPO, he evaded their efforts and was verbally abusive towards them over the phone. \nPolice eventually found him \u201chunkered down in the driver\u2019s seat\u201d of his vehicle, which \nwas across the street from his girlfriend\u2019s residence. They asked him to exit his vehicle, \nbut he refused, so they physically escorted him. They served him with the PO and \narrested him. Police charged him with stalking and obstruction of justice. Later that \nmorning, he was released on bond and admonished that he must abide by the terms of \nthe PO.

He claimed that he was trying to get his wallet back that he had left \nat her house. Regardless, once she returned his wallet in the parking lot, he reached \ninto her car and grabbed her arm. After this incident, she drove to the police department \nto file criminal charges against him. Uncowed, he followed her in his vehicle at least part \nof the way to the police station. (Items 2, 4, 6-9) \nThat same day, police arrested Applicant again and charged him with violating \nthe PO, stalking, and assault and battery. The next day, his girlfriend filed a criminal \ncomplaint against him for grabbing her by the hair in June 2021 and strangling her in \nSeptember 2021. On December 28, 2021, he was arrested for the third time in four days \nand charged with committing assault and battery in September 2021. Courts ultimately \nfound him guilty of two violations of the PO. He was sentenced to six months in jail with \nfive months and 29 days suspended. The court either dismissed or entered orders of \nnolle prosequi on the remaining charges. The court also entered additional protective \norders that prohibited Applicant from having contact with his girlfriend until as late as \nFebruary 2024. On December 28, 2022, because of his criminal charges, he was barred \nfor 30 days from the military base where he worked. All his aforementioned criminal \nbehavior is corroborated by police reports and court records. (Items 2, 4-10) \nApplicant was required to divulge the crimes that resulted in his December 2021 \narrests on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in \nJanuary 2022 (six days after his last arrest). He failed to do so. While it was not alleged \nin the SOR, he did not volunteer these arrests to the DOD investigator during his August \n2022 security interview. Instead, he was evasive about his criminal conduct. When the \ninvestigator asked Applicant about these arrests, he declined to elaborate on them, \nmerely claiming that he and his girlfriend were going through \u201cstuff\u201d and \u201crelationship \nthings.\u201d Applicant failed to elaborate on his underlying conduct related to these arrests \nuntil the DOD investigator asked him multiple times and confronted him with his arrests. \nHe has denied stalking or physically harming his girlfriend. He also denied threatening \nto harm his girlfriend and her family. He has not undergone any behavioral counseling \nor treatment. He claimed he did not divulge his criminal charges on the SF 86 because \nhe did not read the questions carefully, and he thought he did not need to disclose \ncharges for which he was awaiting court dates. (Items 2-9) \nA credit report reflects that Applicant\u2019s federal student loan account was charged \noff by August 2022. The Government listed this account in SOR \u00b6 2.a. An August 2022 \ncredit report reflected a last payment date of July 2021. The credit reports reflect that \nthe account was past due in the amount of $4,718 with a total loan balance of $44,082. \nA February 2023 credit report reflects that the account is still charged off, but that \nApplicant is paying under a partial payment agreement of $222 per month. This credit \nreport reflects a last payment date of January 2023. However, since about March 2020, \nfederal student loans repayments have been deferred under various executive orders \nbecause of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s federal \nstudent loan account was delinquent before the payments on it were deferred by \nPresidential executive order.

(ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has been charged with several serious criminal offenses, and there is \nsufficient evidence of his criminal conduct in the form of guilty pleas, police reports, \ncourt records, and credible allegations from his victim. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt has only been about one and one-half years since Applicant last engaged in \ncriminal behavior. His most serious criminal conduct occurred when he was having \nissues with a romantic relationship. While there is no bright line rule of how much time is \nsufficient to show mitigation, given the seriousness of his conduct, and his willingness to \ncontinue it despite being arrested the first time, I find that it has not been long enough. \nMoreover, problems with romantic relationships are not unusual. I cannot find that the \ncircumstances that led to his criminal behavior are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not \napply. \nApplicant continues to deny that he assaulted or stalked his girlfriend. I find that \nhe did both. I believe he is being untruthful about a material fact relevant to a security \nclearance adjudication. Falsifying material information in a security clearance \nadjudication is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001. Therefore, Applicant \ncontinues to engage in criminal behavior, further undercutting his efforts at mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 32(a), as well as under AG \u00b6 32(d), which require the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal acts. Given the recency of criminal activity, and his lack of \nacceptance of responsibility, AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do not apply. AG \u00b6 32(c) does \nnot apply because there is reliable evidence of criminal conduct in the form of credible \nallegations, police reports, and court records. None of the Guideline J mitigating \nconditions apply. The criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loan payments were deferred because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. There is no evidence that he defaulted on this loan prior to the automatic \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndeferral. The evidence is not sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. I find \nin his favor with respect to the Guideline F security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant did not divulge his December 2021 criminal charges on his SF 86 \ndespite being required to do so. He claimed that he did not understand that he had to \nreport criminal activity for which he had not gone to court. I find this explanation lacks \ncredibility and that he deliberately omitted these arrests. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established with \nrespect to his omissions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has committed several driving infractions and violated his probation \nrelated to one of those violations. These actions support an assessment of questionable \njudgment, unreliability, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. AG \u00b6 16(d) is raised by this conduct. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nDeliberately omitting information from an SF 86 is not minor as it strikes at the \nheart of the security clearance process. Applicant did not volunteer his December 2021 \narrests before he was confronted by the investigator during his security interview. \nInstead, when the investigator asked about these arrests, Applicant attempted to \nconceal the specifics and minimize their severity. There is no evidence that he has \nobtained counseling or taken any other positive steps to show that such behavior is \nunlikely to recur or to reduce vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. None \nof the Guideline E mitigating factors apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, F, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the criminal conduct and personal conduct security concerns. The financial \nconsiderations security concerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

At \nthe hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of seven exhibits. (GEs 1-7) Applicant \nrelied on one witness (himself) and three exhibits (AEs A-C). The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on June 14, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated five delinquent \nconsumer debts exceeding $7,000 and child support arrears exceeding $146,307. \nAllegedly, these debts have not been resolved and remain outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted four of the alleged SOR debts \n(covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, and 1.d-1.f, but denied the allegations covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.c. ) He provided no explanations or clarifications. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in March 2004 and divorced in in September 2005. (GE 1) He \nhas no children from this marriage. He remarried in March 2012 and divorced in May \n2017. He has two children from this marriage (ages 15 and nine). (GE 1; Tr. 22) He \nremarried for his third marriage in July 2017 and separated in April 2020 without any \nchildren from the marriage. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 49) Currently, Applicant is waiting for his third \nspouse to file for divorce. (GE 4) He does not know of the whereabouts of his third \nspouse, and he has no known financial obligations to her. (GE 4) \nApplicant earned a high school diploma in June 2001. He enlisted in the Air \nForce (AF) in 2002 and served 11 years of active duty before receiving an honorable AF \ndischarge in September 2013. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 21) \nSince October 2018, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. \n(GEs 2-3; Tr. 20) Previously, he worked for other employers. He reported \nunemployment between September 2013 and September 2014, and between \nSeptember 2017 and December 2018. (GEs 2-3) Applicant held a security clearance \nwhile in the Air Force.

(GE 2) \nBetween April 2007 and February 2016, Applicant resided with his then-fiance \nwho in 2012 became his second spouse. (GE 2) For the first four years of their \nrelationship, Applicant shared half of his fiance\u2019s mortgage expenses. (GE 2) \nSeparating from his spouse in February 2016, Applicant briefly resided in a State A \napartment (February 2016 to July 2016) before moving on to State B without any \nevidence of voluntary spousal and child support to his second spouse of four years and \ntwo small children. (GE 2) \nWhat steps Applicant\u2019s second spouse pursued to induce Applicant to provide \nvoluntary spousal and child support prior to their May 2017 divorce is not fully \ndeveloped in the record. Some evidence of his possible post-divorce voluntary efforts to \nprovide monetary support to his wife and children is reflected in his 2021 personal \nsubject interview (PSI) acknowledgements that he became delinquent on his child \nsupport \u201cpayment of $10,000\u201d to his former spouse and children \u201cafter he lost his job.\u201d \n(GE 3) any pre-divorce child and spousal discussions he may have had with send \nspouse is not evidenced in the record. \nCredit reports confirm Applicant\u2019s accumulation of five delinquent consumer \naccounts between 2018 and 2021 as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a (for $3,932); 1.b (for $556); 1.d \n(for $1,634); 1.e (for $1,021); and 1.f (for $6,558). (GEs 5-6) While Applicant disputed \none of these listed SOR debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a), he provided no documentary support for his \ndispute of the debt. None of the remaining consumer debts listed in the SOR are \nsupported by any documentation or other corroborating evidence of payment or \npayment arrangements. \nIncome withholding orders (IWOs) were issued by State B\u2019s child support \nservices agency to Applicant\u2019s employer in October and December 2018, respectively,\nin accordance with an issued 2016 court order in State A to withhold from Applicant\u2019s\nmonthly pay portions of his income to cover current and arrears child and spousal\nsupport. (AEs A-B) The 2018 IWOs issued by the State B child support services agency\ndirected Applicant\u2019s employer to deduct monthly amounts as follows: $1,413.90 a month\nfor current child support; $468.70 a month for past-due child support-(arrears greater\nthan 12 weeks); $23.55 a month for current cash medical support; $7.98 a month for\npast-due medical support; and $1,516.16 a month for past-due spousal support, for a\ntotal amount withholding of $3,928 a month. (GEs 1-6 and AEs A-B; Tr. 18)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy all accounts, portions of Applicant\u2019s monthly income have been regularly \nwithheld by his employer between October 2018 and February 2023 in partial \ncompliance with the 2018 IWOs. (GEs 1-2) Asked at hearing whether spousal and child \nsupport have been withheld from his monthly pay, Applicant responded in the \naffirmative. (Tr. 27-28, 42-3) Applicant\u2019s acknowledgements were credible and were \naccepted by the Government in closing. (Tr. 48) Because Applicant\u2019s monthly \nwithholding has been consistently less than what was prescribed in the IWOs, his \nwithheld payments have never come close to the withholding amounts prescribed in the \n2018 IWOs.

(GEs 5-6) Without any credited \nreduction in the reported balance owing, the principal balance of the arrears can be \nexpected to increase over time. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts between 2019 and 2022 to meet with child support services \npersonnel \u201cto have the amount owed reduced and my child support order modified,\u201d to \ninclude reductions in his monthly child support withholding and overall principal balance, \nwere never successful. (GE 1; Tr. 28) And, meeting requests by the State B child \nsupport services agency to discuss Applicant\u2019s pay status could never be agreed on \nwith Applicant. (Tr. 27) \nA revised IWO was issued to Applicant\u2019s employer in February 2023. (GE 7) In \nthis IWO, Applicant\u2019 s employer was directed to withhold portions of Applicant\u2019s pay in \naccordance with a revised withholding schedule, Applicant\u2019s employer was directed to \nwithhold monthly amounts from Applicant\u2019s pay as follows: $1,413.90 a month for \ncurrent child support; $180.68 a month for past-due child support (arrears greater than \n12 weeks); $23.55 a month for current cash medical support; $4.65 a month for past-\ndue cash medical support, and $314.67 a month for past-due spousal support, for a \ntotal amount withheld of $1,937.45 a month. (GE 7)  \nCurrently, Applicant\u2019s employer withholds between $150 to $200 bi-weekly (still \n50 % of his take-home pay) to cover the withholding criteria se by State B\u2019s withholding \norders. (Tr. 40) Based on the evidence presented, Applicant and his employer have \ncomplied with been in compliance with the issued February 2023 IW0. Applicant \ncurrently makes $20 an hour, which represents a increase over his hourly pay in 2018 \n(only $15 an hour). (Tr. 21) In addition to his hourly wages, he receives a 70 % disability \nfrom the Veterans Administration (VA) that amounts to $2,000 a month. While he was \nunemployed for a year after being \u201cwritten off of his contract\u201d in September 2017, he \nmade no child support payments; even though he received notices of the IWOs from the \nchild support agencies in both State A and State B. (GE 2; Tr. 24) \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to enforce his child visiting rights with his ex-spouse and \nmother of his two children have not been successful. She has consistently denied him \nvisiting privileges with his children. (Tr. 46) Further, he has had no communications with \nhis ex-spouse about enlisting her support and assistance in his efforts to obtain child \nsupport reductions. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant currently rents his home ($1,000 a month) and expends $840 a month \non an expensive vehicle he purchased in 2019, which he characterized as his \u201cdream \ncar.\u201d (GEs 5-6; Tr.30-31, 38) He is in compliance with his payment obligations with his \ncurrent credit card accounts.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).

These collective debt delinquencies and 2023 child and \nspousal support order in place warrant the application of three of the disqualifying \nconditions (DC) of the financial considerations guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to \nthe specific facts of Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debts are fully documented and create judgment \nissues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies is critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited explanations for his debt delinquencies (primarily due to losing \nhis job in 2017 and becoming depressed with suicidal symptoms) are insufficient to \nwarrant the full application of any of the potentially available mitigating conditions to his \nreported delinquent consumer debts. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances in light of his cited periods of unemployment and spousal separations. \nApplication of MC \u00b6 20(b) is very limited Applicant\u2019s case, however, for he has failed to \nsatisfy the \u201cthe acting responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6. 20(b) following his return to full-time \nemployment in 2018. \nCurrently, Applicant has no well-developed financial plan or refined budget in \nplace to aid him in mitigating the Government\u2019s financial concerns over his delinquent \ndebts. And, with the exception of the consumer debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a (which he \ndisputes without documentary support), he has made no concerted efforts to resolve his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndelinquent accounts with the ample resources available to him over the past four years \nin which he has been gainfully employed on a full-time basis. \nOf continuing security concern are the two State B IWOs covering Applicant\u2019s \nchild and spousal support owed to his ex-wife residing in State A. By far, these IWOs \nthat have since been revised and consolidated under a February 2023 IWO represent \nApplicant\u2019s largest debt and currently exceed $146,307 in current and arrears child and \nspousal support. These IMOs have been in force since 2018 have consistently been \nenforced and complied with over the past five years without any breaks in withholding of \nthe calculated amounts deducted from Applicant\u2019s monthly income. \nWhile the income withheld from Applicant\u2019s monthly pay under the IWOs in force \nhave been involuntary, the withholdings are distinguishable from garnishments and \nattachments customarily used in enforcement actions. See ISCR Case No. 20-03457 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2023) Unlike customary garnishments, Applicant\u2019s withheld \nincome for child and spousal support (both current and arrears) are not considered \npunitive under the laws of his current state of residence. See A.R.S., \u00b6\u00b6 25-505 and 25-\n505.01. Rather, IWOs are treated as imposed payment obligations on Applicant to \nensure his children\u2019s comfort and well-being. Put another way, the income withholding \n(for both current and arrears child and spousal support) imposed on Applicant are \nconsidered under the IWO law of State B to be withholding for both current and arrears \namounts due and in this respect is distinguishable from garnishment.     \nStill, Applicant\u2019s income withholding in compliance with the IWOs in force in \nStates A and B cannot be considered sufficient to fully meet the good-faith repayment \nrequirements of MC \u00b6 20(d). For Applicant\u2019s withheld income to reflect good-faith \npayment initiatives, some form of voluntary acceptance of withholding on his part was \nrequired. Nothing in the recitations of the IWOs in issue make any mention of \nApplicant\u2019s concurrence in the issued IWOs. So while the IWOs in issue are \ndistinguishable from garnishments, they do not equate to any form of voluntary, good-\nfaith repayment actions on Applicant\u2019s part. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction with respect to his consumer debt delinquencies to \nsatisfy Appeal Board guidance. \nBy contrast, the State B IWOs in force over the past five years that have dictated \nthe withholdings of his income to cover his current and arrears child and spousal \nsupport, reflect a considerable period of IWO compliance, even if they have not been \nfully implemented due to Applicant\u2019s minimal monthly income subject to withholding. \nFor so long as Applicant remains employed by his current employer, or other employer \nin State B, he can be expected to be subject to the IWOs in place until they expire, or \nare otherwise withdrawn. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n                                      \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance.

He did not list any other \ndelinquent debts. During his background interview in April 2021, Applicant admitted a \npast-due car loan that he said was not currently delinquent.

When confronted with the \ndebts during his ROI, Applicant admitted them. He stated he did not list them due to an \noversight regarding the requirements for listing. Applicant stated the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d were solo credit cards. Further, he was not aware of the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c but did not dispute it. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e (a utility bill) he stated \nwas his, but he disputed the underlying charge due to a former landlord\u2019s failure to remove \nhim from the bill after he had moved. (Items 2-6) \nApplicant admitted the debts alleged in the SOR in his response to an interrogatory \nfrom the DODCAF. For the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, he admitted they were not \npaid, payment arrangements had not been made, and he was not making payments. He \nstated the alleged debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been paid. He stated he had run into hard times \nwith his family\u2019s expenses post his Afghanistan deployment and he overextended his \nfamily\u2019s finances. He admitted poor financial planning while on active duty. He states he \nhad been working with a credit counseling team to pay down his debts, but these were \ncharged off while he was actively paying on them. He states further, \u201c[n]ow that I am \nretired and able to afford to fix my mistakes, I am trying to do so by leveraging planners \nas well as legal to reduce the amount I have to pay and fix my credit within all the laws \nthat exist.\u201d He states that he stopped paying his charged-off debts on the advice of a \nwealth manager. He attached his 2021 W-2 and his 02/11/2022 pay stub as proof he has \nsufficient means to satisfy these debts. His personal financial statement indicates \nsufficient discretionary funds monthly. His credit reports also indicate he was able to pay \nseveral sizable car loans, though not always on time.

(Items 1, 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts. He has \nprovided evidence of sufficient financial means to pay his debts but expressed his \nintention to leave them unsatisfied. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

It \ndoes not appear on the most recent credit report. That debt is mitigated. \nApplicant has known about the remaining debts for some period. He made \nassertions he had begun paying some of them but was then financially unable to do so \nwhile still on active duty. Though he provided evidence of his current financial situation, \nhe has expressly chosen to ignore the remaining debts. He mentioned he may have been \nthe victim of identity theft, that he had worked with fraud sections, and had gotten a debt \nconsolidation loan, but provided no additional corroboration to support his statements. He \nwas on notice his debts were of a concern to the government. He was confronted during \nhis interview regarding concerns about these debts, received and answered the \nDODCAF\u2019s interrogatories regarding concerns about these debts, received and replied to \nthe SOR specifically noting concerns about these debts, and received Department \nCounsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material, which also pointed to the concern over these debts. \nHe has demonstrated he has the means to resolve them and admits to affirmatively \nchoosing not to do so. He has stated he would attempt to do so should they put his \nclearance at risk. However, potential undefined intentions to resolve debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. \nSee ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are the result of his admitted overextension of family \nfinances while on active duty and were exacerbated with his wife\u2019s loss of her job in 2020 \nand during the COVID-19 crises. Though he states he will attempt to resolve these debts \nif they will have an effect on his clearance, this inaction does not constitute good faith as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontemplated by Appeal Board precedent. It does not mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his conduct. It appears the primary catalyst that might lead him to address his \ndelinquencies is the desire for a security clearance. He has had the ability to pay his debts \nbut has chosen not to. His failure to act responsibly regarding his financial obligations \npreclude finding that he has good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) - 20(d) are not established \nregarding the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d. Applicant did not meet his burden to mitigate \nthe financial concerns set out in the SOR. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out \nof Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He has a high school \ndiploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to eleven delinquent accounts \ntotaling in excess of $20,156. Applicant admits each of the debts listed in the SOR. \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated September 7, 2007; February 17, 2018; September \n30, 2021; April 22, 2022; and March 31, 2023, confirm the indebtedness. (Government \nExhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.) Applicant served in the U.S. Army from September 2000 until \nMarch 2006, and received an honorable discharge. He began working for his current \nemployer in October 2017. \nApplicant stated that his financial problems resulted from an unexpected 55 \npercent salary reduction at work. His loss of income caused him to quit his job and \nmove in order to find a job that paid enough to support his family. Applicant\u2019s wife lost \nher job about the same time. Applicant explained that as a parent with a large family he \nfelt compelled to make some difficult decisions to make sure that he fed and took care \nof his family\u2019s needs. As a result he provided for his family and did not pay his bills. He \nstated that he is currently working with a credit repair company to begin to resolve his \ncredit card debts. He plans to start paying the debts starting with the lowest balances \nfirst. \nApplicant attached to his Answer to the SOR an email from a credit repair \ncompany showing a payment that Applicant made to a creditor. \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDue to a drastic salary reduction at work, Applicant could not afford to pay his \nbills and support his family at the same time. His wife also lost her job. He incurred \ndelinquent debt he could not afford to pay. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control initially caused his financial \nproblem, namely his unexpected 55 percent salary reduction at work. As a result, he \nwas forced to quit the job and move to obtain new employment in order to support his \nfamily. His wife also lost her job about the same time. However, since October 2017, \nhe has been employed full time. He gives no reasonable excuse why his excessive \nindebtedness still exists when he has been employed on a full-time basis since October \n2017, over five and half years. While Applicant claims that he has started working with \na credit repair company and is making payments towards resolving his debts, he has \nsubmitted little documentary evidence to support this claim. From the limited evidence \npresented, his debts remain delinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long \nreflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nThere is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Applicant has made efforts to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F. Without documentary evidence \nsubstantiating his assertions that he has been making payments to the creditors, that he \nis currently financially responsible, and that he is able to meet his future financial \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nobligations, Applicant has not carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \nsecurity concerns alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nWhile Applicant claims that he is making payments towards his debts, (with the \nexception of an email from the credit repair company showing a payment he made in \nthe amount of $213.66 to a creditor not listed in the SOR), he has submitted no other \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this \ncase. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all allegations in the SOR. Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security clearance. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He has been employed with his current employer, Employer A, since September 2021. He also interned for Employer A while in college from June 2020 to December 2020. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2021. He is single and has no children.

(SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant admits this allegation. In May 2021, Applicant received a job offer from Employer B. His employment was contingent upon Employer B\u2019s pre-employment screening to include drug testing. Applicant passed his first drug test, which he provided in May 2021.

However, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to the amended allegation SOR \u00b6 2.b because of the short \nnotice given this new allegation. He was not prepared to present evidence on this issue. \nI advised the parties that I intended to keep the record open one month to allow \nApplicant\u2019s counsel to present new evidence regarding the new allegation. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel mentioned the possibility of Applicant undergoing an assessment pertaining to \nsubstance abuse. Department Counsel objected to this assessment, because they \nwould not have the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who will make the \nassessment. I advised Department Counsel if Applicant submits a substance abuse \nassessment, they have an opportunity to review the assessment and can request to \nreopen the proceedings to allow them the opportunity to cross-examine the expert. (Tr. \n33-37) Both amendments were granted, subject to the conditions in the above \nparagraph. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

On August 4, 2021, Employer B rescinded the offer of \nemployment because he failed to successfully pass the drug screen. (Tr. 20-21, 39-41; \nGE 3)   \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant falsified material facts during a February 28, \n2022, interview with an authorized investigator for the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement, by answering \u201cNo\u201d when asked about whether he used illegal drugs \nwithin the last seven years.

He lied \nbecause he thought he would lose another job if he admitted that he used illegal drugs. \nHe wanted to protect his job. (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Tr. 24-25; GE 2 at 7) \nAs stated above, the SOR also alleged Applicant deliberately falsified material \nfacts on a security clearance application, dated June 2, 2021, when he answered \u201cNo\u201d \nin response to \u201cSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Use of \nDrugs or Controlled Substances \u2013 \u201cIn the last seven years, have you illegally used any \ndrugs or controlled substances?

Employer A offered him a position which he accepted. He completed the \ne-QIP in June 2021, and he passed a drug test in August 2021. He started work at \nEmployer A in September 2021. (Tr. 17, 20-23; GE 1; GE 3) \nApplicant started using marijuana in high school. He began using marijuana \nalmost every day starting his sophomore year in college. He no longer socializes with \nthe people he used marijuana with while in college. None of his personal friends use \nmarijuana. He took and passed two drug tests in October 2022 and July 2023. (AE C \nand AE I) The last time he used marijuana was in May 2021. He has no intention to use \nmarijuana in the future.

(SOR \u00b6 1.c: GE 1 at 31-32; Tr. 30-32) \nDrug Involvement \nUnder the drug involvement security concern, the SOR alleged Applicant failed a \nurinalysis test in or about August 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 3) Applicant admits this \nallegation. However, it is likely Applicant submitted his urine sample in May or June \n2021. He was notified by Employer B that their employment offer was rescinded in early \nAugust 2021. \nOn August 12, 2023, Dr. E., Ph.D., ABPP, a board-certified psychologist \nevaluated Applicant. The purpose of the evaluation was to determine whether Applicant \nhad a substance use condition, personality patterns, or behavioral propensities that \ncould negatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness or judgment. Applicant provided \nthe information about the issues with his security clearance to Dr. E. Upon reviewing the \ndocuments, interviewing Applicant, and conducting several tests, Dr. E. concluded \nApplicant does not exhibit signs or symptoms of a substance use disorder at the present \ntime, and it is unlikely he has ever met criteria for such a condition in the past. He notes \nthat while Applicant\u2019s marijuana use in college was unhealthy and ill-advised, it is not \nunusual for college students to use marijuana. Studies have shown up to 44% of \ncollege-aged adults use marijuana. He notes Applicant last used marijuana in 2021, and \nhe has no desire to use marijuana in the future. He also notes that the risk for future \nmarijuana use by Applicant is extremely low. Applicant\u2019s prognosis for continued \npsychological wellness is excellent. (AE L) \nOn September 5, 2023, Applicant provided another urinalysis sample. His \nsample tested negative for illegal drugs to include marijuana.  (AE M) \nWhole-Person Factors \nApplicant submitted several character letters. Mr. T., his former supervisor \nrecommends him for a security clearance. He describes Applicant as a highly \nprofessional, trustworthy individual. He supervised him for over one and half years. He \nobserved Applicant being respectful and mindful of security policies and restrictions. He \nhas always trusted Applicant and has had no reason to doubt or question him. He finds \nhim worthy of having his security clearance reinstated so that he can continue in his \npromising career. (AE H; AE J) \nMs. B. has known Applicant for 21 years.

(AE \nN) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d \naddressing concerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states \nand the District of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local \nlaws do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use, but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus, knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse;  \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia.  \nThe amended SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana from 2018 \nto May 2021. Most of his use occurred while he was in college. Marijuana use is legal in \nthe state where he resides, however, he is aware that marijuana use remains illegal \nunder federal law. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant used and \npossessed marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c) apply. \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana during a pre-employment drug test for \nCompany B. AG \u00b6 25(b) applies. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)) \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant stopped using Marijuana in May 2021. His \npositive pre-employment drug test for Company B \u201cscared him straight.\u201d More than two \nand a half years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last involvement with marijuana. While \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana raises questions about his judgment, his use \noccurred primarily in college, and he learned the hard way that it was time for him to \nfollow the law. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because Applicant acknowledged his illegal drug use and \nsigned a statement of intent indicating he will not use marijuana in the future. He \nacknowledged any future illegal use could result in the revocation of his security \nclearance. He testified that he no longer associates with his college friends with whom \nhe used marijuana. \nOverall, Applicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative;  \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: deliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information; or concealing or omitting information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical or mental health professional involved in making a \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or \nother official government representative: (3) a pattern of dishonesty and \nrule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment.  \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. Applicant admits that he deliberately omitted his illegal \nmarijuana use in response to Section 23 on his June 2021 security clearance \napplication. He omitted his marijuana use out of fear he would lose his job. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) applies. Applicant deliberately lied to the investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation in February 2022, when he denied using illegal drugs within \nthe past seven years, when he had, in fact, used marijuana on a regular basis from \n2018 to May 2021. This response is aggravated by the fact that Applicant was aware at \nthe time that he lost the job offer with Employer B in August 2021 because of his \npositive drug test. Applicant admits he lied because he was worried about getting a \nsecurity clearance and the potential for losing his job with Employer A. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies with regards to Applicant\u2019s pattern of dishonesty throughout \nthe security clearance process regarding his illegal marijuana use. His lack of candor \nraises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nAG \u00b6 16(f) applies pertaining to his positive drug test, which resulted in Employer \nB rescinding the offer of employment because a clean drug test was a pre-condition of \nhis employment. \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances,or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Applicant withheld his deliberate omission of illegal \nmarijuana use until after the SOR was issued. While credit is given to Applicant for fully \ndisclosing the extent of his illegal marijuana use during the hearing, his disclosure \ncannot be considered prompt. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. Applicant deliberately lied to the federal government \non several occasions about his illegal drug use during the security clearance process. \nWhile he fully disclosed his illegal marijuana use during the hearing, he admitted he lied \npreviously because he was afraid he would not be granted a security clearance and \nlose his job. While Applicant eventually provided full disclosure, his numerous deliberate \nfalsifications still raise questions about his trustworthiness and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) partially applies. Applicant fully disclosed the extent of his illegal \nmarijuana use during the hearing. I found him cooperative. He was assessed by a \nlicensed psychologist who found no substance abuse issues. However, this mitigating \ncondition is given less weight because of the extent of Applicant\u2019s false statements. \nWhile Applicant has made steps to fully disclose his illegal drug use to the federal \ngovernment, his deliberate falsifications during the security clearance process created \ndoubt about his judgment and truthfulness. The federal government expects security \nclearance holders and applicants for a security clearance to be truthful with the \ngovernment at all times. Deliberate falsifications during the security clearance process \nare serious violations of the government\u2019s trust and raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nability to work with and protect classified information. Personal Conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n10 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n           I considered Applicant\u2019s performance awards and favorable character \nreferences. I considered he ultimately disclosed his illegal marijuana use during the \nhearing and expressed remorse for his past conduct. I considered that he learned a \ndifficult lesson after his positive marijuana test in 2021 and stopped using marijuana in \nMay 2021. I find Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H because it \nhas been more than two and half years since he last used marijuana and he signed a \nstatement of intent to no longer use illegal drugs in the future.  \n \n          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nUnder Personal Conduct, a security concern remains about Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nlies about his illegal marijuana use during the security clearance process. He \ndeliberately lied about his illegal marijuana use on his June 2021 security clearance \napplication and during his February 2022 background investigation interview. Questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s truthfulness remain. The security concerns under Personal Conduct \nare not mitigated. \nFor the reasons stated above, I cannot grant Applicant a security clearance at \nthis time. If he continues to progress, remains truthful, and continues to abstain from \nillegal drug use, he is likely to be granted a security clearance at some point in the \nfuture. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns under Personal \nConduct are not mitigated. The security concerns under Drug Involvement are \nmitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Miller, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/01/2023 \nDecision \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 19, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November \n25, 2022. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. The \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 2 through 7 (Item 1 is the SOR). Applicant \ndid not submit a response to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 2-\n7 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on January 27, 2023.\n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.r except for 1.k, which he \ndenied. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He married in 2021 and has no children. He attended \ntechnical college from June 2002 to May 2006 and earned an associate\u2019s degree. He also \nattended another college from August 2004 to May 2009 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nHe then attended college from August 2010 to May 2011 but did not earn a degree. He \nis being sponsored for a security clearance, but apparently, he is not yet employed by his \nsponsor, a defense contractor. \nApplicant attributed his financial hardship to work being slow and he was unable \nto find a job. He disclosed periods of unemployment from August 2010 to September \n2011, January 2012 to May 2012, August 2012 to February 2013, and April 2020 to May \n2021. He also reported he experienced underemployment. He stated in his SOR answer \nthat when he graduated from college in 2009, he was overwhelmed by the magnitude of \nhis student loans. He hoped to get a good job and begin paying them within six months. \nHe was unable to get a job commensurate with his degree and had to accept lower-paying \nemployment to pay his expenses. He further stated that he attempted to rectify his \nfinancial difficulties with loans but was unable to pay any \u201cup-front payments required by \nthe agencies on an exact date given.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant also stated in his SOR answer that he has a hearing disability that makes \nit challenging to rectify his financial issues over the phone. He said, \u201cI have taken the \nnecessary steps with the granting agencies in a good-faith effort to repay if current debt \ncould be restructured based on current income, resolve some of the debt in full, and/or to \nmake restitution with set monthly payments.\u201d (Item 2) He did not provide documents to \nshow what specific agreements or steps he has taken toward a particular debt. He also \nhoped to use future income tax refunds to satisfy his debts. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling approximately $114,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.n), additional allegations for failure to pay federal income taxes for tax years \n2017, 2018, and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.o - $8,892), and failure to pay state income taxes for tax \nyears 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.p - $4,521). The SOR also alleged Applicant \nfailed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and his 2017 state \nincome tax return (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q-1.r). \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions, SOR answer, statements made to the government \ninvestigator that were affirmed in his interrogatories, tax transcripts, and credit reports \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom July 2021, February 2022, and July 2022 corroborate the SOR allegations. (Items \n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR regarding the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, \n1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p, he states that he will pay the debts or enter into a settlement \nagreement if he is able to attain a security clearance and employment. These debts are \nunresolved. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR regarding the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, \nhis delinquent student loans (approximately $99,875), he provided a copy of \ncorrespondence with the Department of Education from July 2022 indicating his student \nloans were in forbearance under the CARES Act and were not currently being collected. \nHis loans were delinquent prior to the CARES Act. During his August 2021 interview with \na government investigator, which he affirmed its accuracy in his July 2022 interrogatories, \nApplicant said that he got behind on paying his loans in August 2017, and he could not \nafford payments. He said he experienced financial hardship at that time and then later \nduring the pandemic. No evidence was provided regarding any payments he made on the \nstudent loans or attempts to address them prior to the forbearance. He stated in his SOR \nAnswer that he has submitted a loan rehabilitation income and expense form to the \ncreditor so he can get an affordable monthly payment plan. This will not be acted upon \nuntil the CARES Act expires. He is also requesting a $10,000 to $20,000 loan forgiveness \nto be credited to the balance he owes. (Item 4) \nApplicant admitted that he owed the IRS approximately $8,892 for delinquent taxes \nfor tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. In his SOR answer he stated: \u201cPayment has been \nstopped until income is acceptable to satisfy debt owed. If I attain this clearance and job \nI will be able to agree to a settlement to satisfy debt.\u201d (Item 2) He did not provide evidence \nthat he made any payments. He provided a document from the IRS that stated he had \nvisited the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center in his home state. The letter references tax \nyear 2019 and states: \u201c[Applicant] has come into the Taxpayer Assistance Center to get \na letter that says he is in Currently Not Collectable status. This letter is to show that he is \nindeed currently not collectable for 2019.\u201d No other information was provided regarding \npayment of his federal tax debt. (Item 2) \nIn response to government interrogatories, Applicant stated he had filed his 2017 \nand 2018 federal income tax returns in July 2020. He disclosed that he owed federal \nincome tax for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. He provided copies of federal income tax \nreturn forms for 2017 and 2018, but they were not signed and there is no proof they were \nmailed and accepted. IRS account transcripts from July 2022 reflect the 2017 and 2018 \ntax returns had not been filed. (Items 2, 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to pay his 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 state \nincome taxes. It also alleged that he failed to timely file his 2017 state income tax return. \nApplicant indicated in his response to interrogatories that he filed his 2015, 2017, 2018 \nstate tax returns in January 2021. State tax forms he provided are unsigned and there is \nno proof that he mailed or filed his 2017 return electronically. A letter included in his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanswer to the SOR from his state department of revenue from July 2016 shows Applicant \nwas assessed $45 for tax period 2015. There is no proof it was paid. Another letter from \nJanuary 2021 to Applicant in bold letters and capitalized says \u201cREMINDER-WE HAVE \nNOT RECEIVED YOUR TAX RETURN.\u201d It also states that he owes $1,050 for tax year \n2017. Letters for tax years 2018 and 2019 show tax debts of $1,711 and $1,519, \nrespectively. Applicant did not provide evidence that he paid these taxes. (Item 2) \nApplicant provided no explanation for his failure to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns. Transcripts show his total federal tax balance is $8,892. It is unknown \nhow the \u201ccurrently not collectable\u201d status for his 2019 taxes is viewed, as it appears the \namount owed for that year ($3,810) is included in the total balance. Although 2019 taxes \nmay not currently be collectible, it does not mean it was not owed or will not be collected \nin the future. (Items 2, 4) \nApplicant denied owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($719) claiming he never signed a \ncontract with the creditor, and that he has contacted the creditor and collection company \nnumerous times. The debt is not listed on his most recent credit report and is resolved in \nhis favor. \nRegarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($1,187), Applicant admitted owing the debt and \nmerely states it was charged off and should be removed from his credit report. It is \nunresolved. For the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($56) and 1.i ($454), he admitted the debts and \nnoted the collection accounts were charged off and will not be reopened for payment. No \nevidence was provided to show he resolved these debts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n4 \n\n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \n5 \n\n \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has approximately $15,198 of delinquent consumer debt and $99,875 of \nstudent loan debt that is presently in forbearance but was delinquent prior to the CARES \nAct moratorium on student loans. He owes $8,892 for delinquent federal income taxes \nand approximately $4,325 for delinquent state income taxes. In addition, he failed to \ntimely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and his 2017 state income tax \nreturn. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has paid or attempted to pay any of his \ndelinquent debts. He began having financial difficulties in 2017 due to underemployment \nand unemployment. He did not provide an explanation for why he failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for 2017 and 2018, nor did he provide proof that they are now \nfiled. He failed to provide proof that his 2017 state income tax return is filed. Applicant \nfailed to provide evidence of any actions he may have taken at the time to make payment \narrangements with the IRS or his state tax authority. Although, his student loans are in \nforbearance due to the CARES Act, they were in delinquent status before then, and he \nsaid he has been unable to pay them since 2017. Applicant\u2019s plan to resolve most of his \ndebts is contingent upon attaining a security clearance for a job he has been offered but \nnot yet started. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing, \nunresolved, and there is insufficient evidence they are unlikely to recur. His \nunemployment and underemployment may have been beyond his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b) Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant provided minimal evidence regarding actions he has taken to \nresolve any of his delinquent debts. There is no evidence he has received financial \ncounseling or has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(g) do not apply. I have given Applicant credit regarding the debt he disputed (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k) and find AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to that debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis omitted, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. He does not have a reliable \nfinancial track record of paying his debts and filing and paying his federal and state \nincome tax returns and taxes. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He \nsaid in the interview summary that as a result, his clearance was suspended for one \nyear, and was reinstated in March 2021. (Item 4 at 10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges (and SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges) that Applicant \u201csolicited escorts \nfor sexual services with varying frequency from approximately 2012 to at least 2020.\u201d In \nhis SOR response, Applicant crossed out the words \u201cat least\u201d and wrote: \nI admit to the Statement of Reasons as Amended with the retraction of the \nphrase \u2018at least.\u201d Since the revocation of my clearance in March 2020, I \nhave discontinued the solicitation of escorts for sexual services as \npromised in a previous telephone conversation. I will not further engage in \nsaid illegal activities. (Item 2) \nApplicant did not elaborate. He did not submit any other statement or evidence with his \nanswer to the SOR and he did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM, so he provided \nno additional information in mitigation. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \nadmitted conduct: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual \nconduct: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant\u2019s actions which occurred while he held a security clearance and while \nworking in the defense industry, put him in a position where he might have been subject \nto coercion, exploitation, or duress. He disclosed his engagement with escorts during a \npre-polygraph interview, on his most recent SCA, and in the subsequent background \ninterview. He also says he disclosed the matter to his wife. AG \u00b6 14(c) applies. \nHowever, the extended nature of his activity as well as its relative recency weighs \nagainst application of AG \u00b6 14(b). The fact that he held a security clearance, while not a \ndisqualifying factor, further weighs against mitigation. I cannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nactions happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, \nand no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 \n14(b) does not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of Applicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline D, \ndiscussed above. SOR \u00b6 1.a is \u201csufficient for an adverse determination,\u201d under \nGuideline D, so AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply to it. However, engaging the services of \nprostitutes satisfies both AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e)(1) and 16(g). It also satisfies the general personal \nconduct security concern of AG \u00b6 15 due to Applicant\u2019s repeated instances of poor \njudgment and failures to comply with rules and regulations that are clearly established. \nAG \u00b6 17 details the personal conduct mitigating conditions. The following warrant \ndiscussion: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s engagement with escorts under \nGuideline E for the same reasons AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply under Guideline D. \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 17(e) applies for the same reasons as set forth in AG \u00b6 14(c). \nApplicant has not established that AG \u00b6 17(d) should fully apply. While he has \nacknowledged the behavior and represented that he has ceased it, he did so in a \nblanket statement in his SOR response, without any corroborating or supporting \nevidence. He has not indicated that he has participated in counseling regarding his \nbehavior, or that circumstances have otherwise changed. As with AG \u00b6 17(c), it also \ndoes not fully apply because he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that his \nconduct will not recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply. Applicant did not establish that the information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(g) applies because Applicant\u2019s engagement with prostitutes has ceased. \nIt was not unwitting, however, and, as addressed above, his actions occurred under \ncircumstances that cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis.

I also had no \nopportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and thus, to assess his credibility. \nApplicant has engaged in a pattern of extremely poor judgment and did so while in \npossession of a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to establish \nthat he has mitigated the security concerns in this case. He has not shown that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

He stated that he was \nstill attempting to find an accountant to prepare and file his income tax returns. He \nhoped to have all the returns filed by the end of 2022. (GE 2) \nTax returns for truck drivers can be complicated and tedious. Applicant and his \nwife had a difficult time finding an accountant or tax preparer who had the requisite \nexpertise and was willing to work on their returns. They retained a tax professional in \nJuly 2022, but their tax returns are challenging. He submitted copies of spreadsheets \nshowing expenses for fuel, food, and lodging. It was the tax professional who informed \nApplicant that he owed taxes for 2013. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that she believed that at \nleast some of the back returns had been filed. She was mistaken. The returns have not \nyet been filed.

He did not always pay the full amount owed.

He asserted that he is \ncommitted to filing the back tax returns, paying whatever taxes are owed, and \ncontinuing to pay his child support. (Tr. at 26-28, 57-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nAE C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes, unfiled tax \nreturns, and child support arrearages. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not realize he owed taxes for 2013 until his new tax professional \ninformed him. Since that time, he has paid the balance, which was as high as $5,529. \nHis unpaid taxes for 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) are mitigated. \nApplicant paid some child support, just not always the required amount, and not \nenough to lower the arrearages. His child is 19 years old and not in high school or \ncollege, so the payments for child support should cease, at which time all of the \npayments will go toward the arrearages. His child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.c) are in \nthe process of being resolved and are mitigated. \nThe greatest concern in this case are the unfiled returns. Failure to comply with \ntax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is \nessential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThis is not a case where the returns went unfiled, but the taxes were paid by \nwithholding from pay. IRS account transcripts for 2017 through 2019 and 2022 do not \nreport any funds withheld from pay nor any other payments. Transcripts for 2020 and \n2021 were not submitted in evidence. Applicant\u2019s wife admitted that the last time they \npaid any federal income taxes was a \u201clong time ago.\u201d This begs the question if Applicant \nthought his income tax returns were being filed, why did he never inquire about whether \nhe owed taxes. Applicant was either grossly negligent or intentionally indifferent. I will \ngive him the benefit of the doubt and find him grossly negligent. \nI understand that Applicant and his wife spend much of their time on the road, \nand their accounting and income tax returns are challenging because they have to \naccount for every dollar spent in fuel, food, and lodging. But that is their responsibility as \ntruck owners. Every truck owner on the road has the same challenges. The bottom line \nis that the returns have still not been filed, and nobody has any idea how much taxes he \nwill owe when they are filed. There are no mitigating conditions applicable to the unfiled \ntax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. There are few things more \nAmerican than being on the road and hauling freight in one\u2019s own truck. However, those \ntrucks run on fuel, and the U.S. Government runs on taxes. Applicant shirked his \nresponsibility to ensure that his tax returns were filed, and any taxes owed were paid. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He claimed he used a \nCBD product sold in local stores to facilitate relief from his aches and pains associated \nwith his disabilities. He acknowledged his mistake to place his trust in a product he did \nnot know anything about and claimed he has since ceased using THC-enhanced drugs. \nAddressing this delinquent debt allegations, Applicant claimed that he is paying \nhis listed delinquent accounts that became delinquent during a period of post-military \nretirement financial difficulties.

(GE \n1; Tr. 23) He has one child (age 14) from his latest marriage. \nApplicant has taken classes from a local university since 2019, about has not \nearned a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in in the Army in March 1996 and \nserved almost 20 years of active duty before receiving an Army medical discharge in \nJuly 2016 with a cited 345% disability. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23, 28) \nSince September 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor as a field service representative. (GE 1) Previously, he worked for other \nemployers in various jobs. (GE 1) He reported unemployment between August 2016 \nand September 2019. (GEs 1-3) Applicant held a security clearance throughout his \nArmy enlistment, as well as with his previous employer before his termination in June \n2021 for cited reasons of testing positive for marijuana. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23) Applicant \ncontinues to receive military disability pay and medical care from the Veterans \nAdministration (VA) to \u201cimprove my way of life.\u201d (Tr. 23) He is currently sponsored by his \nemployer for a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 29) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nDuring a routine, randomized drug screening in June 2021, Applicant tested \npositive for marijuana. (GE 5) Although the amount of THC in his system was not \nrecorded, enough THC was found to confirm a positive test for marijuana. As the result \nof his positive drug test, he was terminated from his employment. (GEs 1 and 6; Tr. 36) \nOnce Applicant learned of his positive drug test, he disposed of all of his cannabidiol \n(CBD oil). (Tr. 36) Prior to appearing for his scheduled randomized drug test in June \n2021, Applicant failed to notify either the Government or his employer that he was \ningesting CBD oil. (Tr. 28-30) Further, he did not list his taking CBD oil in the security \nclearance application he completed for his current employer. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant denied using marijuana prior to his positive drug test and claimed he \nhad tried a new product (CBD) oil recommended to him by a friend that he purchased in \na local store to help him achieve some relief from the aches and pains associated with \nhis disabilities. (Applicant\u2019s Response; Tr. 23-24) He claimed he did not know the CBD \noil was enhanced with THC, the main component of marijuana. And, for this reason he \ndid not list his use of CBD oil in his electronic questionnaire for investigations \nprocessing (e-QIP) he completed for his current employer. Nor did he notify his current \nemployer that he used CBD oil and was fired from his employer at the time as the result \nof his positive drug test. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31) Asked why he did not disclose his positive \ndrug test to his current employer, Applicant responded that \u201che didn\u2019t think it was \u201cgoing \nto be a big issue because he not smoked marijuana prior to his positive drug test.

(Applicant\u2019s response; Tr. 24, 30-31) He \nbased his entire denial of marijuana in his system when tested on his verbal assurances \nthat he has never used marijuana and has since ceased using any form of CBD oil. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response, Tr. 24) Asked about documented proof of his taking CBD oil \nlaced with THC, Applicant could not provide any product labels, correspondence, or \nother proof to verify his use of CBD oil prior to testing positive for marijuana in his \nsystem. (Tr. 30) Nor could he furnish any documentation of his claimed pre-test \nnotification to his employer at the time of his pre-test use of CBD oil in 2016. (Tr. 30-31) \nWhether the VA would have prescribed CBD oil to Applicant is unclear and really \ndependent upon the levels of THP in the product to be prescribed. \nWhile THC is a chemical element typically found in both CBD-sourced hemp \nplants and marijuana plants, Applicant could furnish no evidence the oil used was \nproven to contain THC at levels that could be mistaken for marijuana in a randomized \ndrug test. (Tr. 32-35). Although traces of THC have been found in studies of CBD oil, \nresearch supporting the drug\u2019s benefits in treating these conditions is still limited. See \nMayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (2023) \nWhen the concentration of THC in tested urine exceeds 50 ng/mL, most tests will \nyield a positive result according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. See https//www.cdc.gov. Currently, the THC content in tested \nmarijuana typically exceeds 13 per cent. See https.//www.urm.rochester.edu. By \ncontrast, THC levels in CBD oils are advertised to contain no THC and typically contain \nno THC, or very small traces (no more than 0.3 percent). See L. Hellicar, Does \ncannabidiol (CBDZ) Contain THC? in https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-\ncbd-have-thc. Still, studies caution that in some lower-grade CBD products (depending \non the source of the marketed CBD oil), tested CBD products can contain sufficiently \nhigh levels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under random drug testing \nprograms. See id. \nAsked to identify the specific CBD oil product he was taking, Applicant could not \n(a) identify the type of CBD product he used, (b) document the labels of the product, or \n(c) supply any other evidence to refute the positive results for marijuana reported in the \ntest results of his June 2021 test (Tr. 32) Because of the risk that CBD products can \npotentially contain varying amounts of THC that exceed the federally and state-\nmandated maximum THC percent levels for public marketing (i.e., 0.3 per cent), \nindividuals are generally advised to check the labels of the CDC products they purchase \nin retail stores licensed to sell CBD products. See Mayo Foundation for Medical \nEducation and Research, supra. (GE 5) \nBased on the evidence produced, interpretation of the test results associated \nwith Applicant\u2019s June 2021 positive drug test leaves only two plausible explanations: \nEither the marijuana tested was marijuana as reported that exceeds recognized cut-off \nlevels for marijuana or related products (inclusive of CBD oil), or the product tested \ncontained THC amounts that exceeded accepted federal and state approval levels of \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n             \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTHC content (i.e., 0.3 per cent).

(GEs 2-4; Tr. 25) Credit reports document that he defaulted in \nhis monthly payments on these two accounts in June 2022.

Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Additional security concerns are initially raised over Applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of delinquent debts \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s randomized positive test for marijuana in 2021 warrants the \napplication of three disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement. \nApplicable DCs are DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(b) \u201ctesting positive for an \nillegal drug\u201d; and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.\u201d \nLegally, licensed sales of hemp-derived CBD oil is not prohibited under either the \nFarm Bill of Applicant\u2019s state of residence or under the federal law enacted in December \n2018 (Public Law 115-334), provided that the hemp-related CBD product contains less \nthan 0..3 per cent of THC content. Important to keep in mind is the generally recognized \nfact that broad spectrum CBD oil can be expected to contain almost no THC, while full \nspectrum CBD products can obtain up to 0.3 per cent of the ingredient. In either \nsituation, for Applicant to produce positive test results for marijuana for what Applicant \ninsists was CBD oil he ingested, reliable findings of CBD oil with THC levels below the \n0.3 per cent THC levels allowed the accepted minimum allowable in his system (and not \nmarijuana) would be needed. \nPlausible explanations for the positive test results for marijuana in June 2021 are \nquite limited based on the evidence in the record. One possibility is Applicant\u2019s \npurchase of poor-quality CBD oil from an unlicensed retailer of CBD produced from a \nhemp plant by an unlicensed farm source containing THC content in excess of 0.3 \npercent. The other possibility is Applicant\u2019s purchasing marijuana from the same or \nother illegal source that exceeded the recognized 50 ng/mL grace amount. Either \noccurring event places Applicant in violation of federal and state criminal laws \ncontrolling the use of THC-laced products in CBD and marijuana in Applicant\u2019s state of \nresidence. \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with CBD \nand any other substances that could potentially place him at risk to testing positive for \nmarijuana. His assurances of sustained avoidance of CBD oil and any other products \nthat could contain THC warrant partial application of one mitigating condition (MCs) of \nthe drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d \nStill, with the positive drug test for marijuana coming only two years prior to his \nhearing, coupled with his inability to document the type of CBD oil he claims to have \nused prior to his positive drug test, it is too soon to absolve Applicant of risks of \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nrecurrence. Without more time to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence \nfrom the use of CBD oil and any other products that could potentially contain the \nprincipal marijuana ingredient (THC), none of the remaining mitigating conditions are \nfully available to Applicant at this time. \nWith only two-plus years of elapsed time since his 2021 positive drug test, more \ntime with more corroborating evidentiary sources to support his continued abstinence \nfrom CDC oil products and other marijuana products that contain levels of THC beyond \ndiscounted traces. More evidence of sustained abstinence is needed from Applicant to \nfacilitate safe predictions that he is no longer a recurrence risk. \nFinancial concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of two \ndelinquent debts exceeding $13,000. These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited difficulties in finding employment following his Army discharge in \n2016 warrant the application of several mitigating conditions. Applicable mitigating \nconditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering \nto a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

A hearing was scheduled for June 6, \n2023, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of six exhibits (GEs 1-6). Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and six \nexhibits (AEs A-F). The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 14, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used marijuana from about April 2021 \nthrough June 2021; (b) tested positive for marijuana in about June 2021 during a routine \ndrug screening; and (c) used marijuana and tested positive for the substance after being \ngranted access to classified information in about 2020. \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated two delinquent debts \nexceeding $13,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved and remain \noutstanding. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted testing positive for marijuana in \nJune 2021 while holding. a security clearance. However, he denied his using marijuana \nprior to his positive test. He added explanations and clarifications. He claimed he used a \nCBD product sold in local stores to facilitate relief from his aches and pains associated \nwith his disabilities. He acknowledged his mistake to place his trust in a product he did \nnot know anything about and claimed he has since ceased using THC-enhanced \nsubstances (i.e., CBD oil). \nAddressing this delinquent debt allegations, Applicant claimed that he is paying \nhis listed delinquent accounts that became delinquent during a period of post-military \nretirement financial difficulties. He further claimed he was taking responsibility for his \ndelinquent accounts, and he added that he is currently paying off his two delinquent \ndebts. \nA final decision on the merits was issued on August 16, 2023. Applicant \nappealed the decision. On appeal, Applicant asserted the trial judge (a) failed to \nproperly consider all available evidence; (2) applied facts not supported by the record, \nrendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and (3) failed to \nproperly apply the mitigating conditions and conduct a whole-person analysis.

(GE \n1; Tr. 23) He has one child (age 14) from his latest marriage. \nApplicant has taken classes from a local university since 2019, but he has not \nearned a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the Army in March 1996 and served \nalmost 20 years of active duty before receiving an Army medical discharge in July 2016 \nwith a cited 345% disability that covered multiple pain issues in different areas of his \nbody. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23, 28) \nSince September 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor as a field service representative. (GE 1) Previously, he worked for other \nemployers in various jobs. (GE 1) He reported unemployment between August 2016 \nand September 2019. (GEs 1-3) Applicant held a security clearance throughout his \nArmy enlistment, as well as with his previous employer before his termination in June \n2021 for cited reasons of testing positive for CBD oil containing THC. (GE 1; Tr. 23) \nApplicant continues to receive military disability pay and medical care from the Veterans \nAdministration (VA) to \u201cimprove my way of life.\u201d (Tr. 23) He is currently sponsored by his \nemployer for a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 29) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nDuring a routine, randomized drug screening in June 2021, Applicant tested \npositive for marijuana. (GE 5) Although the amount of THC in his system was not \nrecorded, enough THC was found to confirm a positive test for marijuana. As the result \nof his positive drug test, he was terminated from his employment. (GEs 1 and 6; Tr. 36) \nOnce Applicant learned of his positive drug test, he disposed of all of his \ncannabidiol (CBD oil). (Tr. 36) Prior to appearing for his scheduled randomized drug \ntest in June 2021, Applicant failed to notify either the Government or his employer at the \ntime that he was ingesting CBD oil. (Tr. 28-31) He neither challenged the positive test \nresults nor offered explanations to his then-employer of what might have caused his \npositive drug test. \nApplicant denied using marijuana prior to his positive drug test and claimed he \nhad tried a new product (CBD oil) recommended and given to him by a friend who \n\u201cbrought\u201d the CBD oil from another state (Applicant\u2019s Response; Tr. 23-24, 37) Before \nusing the brand CBD oil recommended to him by his friend at the time, he was gifted \nCBD oil on two prior occasions \u201cfrom a different source \u201cat a local gas station. (Tr. 23-\n24) Claiming he did not know the CBD oil he obtained was enhanced with THC (the \nmain psychoactive component of marijuana), he neither checked the contents of the \nproduct on his pre-test form he completed for his prior employer (Tr. 30-31) nor listed \nhis use of CBD oil in his electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe completed for his current employer. Asked why he did not disclose his positive drug \ntest to his current employer in the e-QIP section, covering illegal drugs, Applicant \nresponded that (a) \u201che didn\u2019t think it was \u201cgoing to be a big issue\u201d because he had not \nsmoked marijuana prior to his positive drug test and (b) his use of CBD oil was not court \nrelated. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant acknowledged his mistake of using pre-test CBD oil without providing \nany documented evidence of pre-test CBD oil in his system and its potential for \nproducing positive test results for marijuana. (Applicant\u2019s response; Tr. 24, 30-31) He \nbased his entire denial of marijuana in his system when tested on his verbal assurances \nthat he has never used marijuana and has since ceased using any form of CBD oil. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response, Tr. 24) Asked about documented proof of his taking CBD oil \nlaced with THC, Applicant could not provide any product labels, correspondence, or \nother proof to verify his use of CBD oil prior to testing positive for marijuana in his \nsystem. (Tr. 30) Whether the Veterans Administration (VA) would have prescribed CBD \noil to Applicant is unclear and may be dependent upon the levels of THC in the product \nto be prescribed. (Tr. 30) \nWhile THC is a chemical element typically found in both CBD-sourced hemp \nplants and marijuana plants, Applicant could furnish no evidence the oil used was \nproven to contain THC at levels that could be mistaken for marijuana in a randomized \ndrug test. (Tr. 32-35). Although traces of THC have been found in studies of CBD oil, \nresearch supporting the drug\u2019s benefits in treating these conditions is still limited. See \nBauer, What are the Benefits of CBD-and is it Safe to Use, Mayo Clinic Press (2023). \n(HE 3) \nWhen the concentration of THC in tested urine exceeds 50 ng/mL, most tests will \nyield a positive result according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. See Urine Testing for Detection of Marijuana: An Advisory, \nhttps//www.cdc.go. (1983). (HE 2) Currently, the THC content in tested marijuana \ntypically exceeds 13 per cent. See C. Halderman-Englert, Cannabinoid Screen and \nConfirmation, Univ. of Rochester Medical Center, https.//www.urm.rochester.edu. \n(2023). (He 4) \nBy contrast, THC levels in CBD oils are advertised to contain no THC and \ntypically contain no THC, or very small traces (no more than 0.3 percent). See L. \nHellicar, Does Cannabidiol (CBDZ) Contain THC? in Medical News Today (2023). (HE \n5) Still, studies caution that in some lower-grade CBD products (depending on the \nsource of the marketed CBD oil), tested CBD products can contain sufficiently high \nlevels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under random drug testing programs. \nSee id. Similar studies are cited in the Security Executive Agent\u2019s (SecEA) December \n2021 guidance on the risks associated with using CBD products that may cause \nsignificantly high levels of THC to result in a positive drug test under agency-\nadministered employment or random drug testing programs.

(Tr. \n36) Having cut off all ties and discarding of the products themselves when \u201che was fired \nfrom work), he could not document any evidence of the CBD products he used and \n\u201cexactly how they worked into my case.\u201d (Tr. 36)  \nPressed further at hearing for details on whether he checked to see whether the \nCBD products he used contained THC, he replied that he did not look at the labels on \nthe CBD products he obtained. (Tr. 37) The only helpful information he could provide \nwas that (a) one of his suppliers was a friend who purchased the CBD from a source in \nanother state and (b) his other two transactions were made at a local gas station without \nany acknowledged close checking of labels. (Tr. 37-38) Asked whether CBD is sold in \ngrocery stores or pharmacies, Applicant replied that he was not aware of such \nmarketing of the product, never \u201cwent back to look,\u201d and could offer no proof of his \nclaimed innocent ingestion of THC oil. (Tr. 38-39) \nBecause of the risk that CBD products can potentially contain varying amounts of \nTHC that exceed the federally and state-mandated maximum THC percent levels for \npublic marketing (i.e., 0.3 per cent), individuals are generally advised to check the labels \nof the CBD products they purchase in retail stores licensed to sell CBD products. See B. \nBauer, What are the Benefits of CBD-and is it Safe to Use, supra, (HE 4) \nBased on the evidence produced, interpretation of the test results associated \nwith Applicant\u2019s June 2021 positive drug test leaves only three plausible explanations:\n(1) Applicant knew, or is imputed to have known, there was THC in the CBD that\nexceeded or likely exceeded  authorized federal limits; (2) Applicant did not know the\nCBD he consumed was likely to contain an excessive amount  of THC; or (3) Applicant\nconsumed a substantial amount of CBD oil either at one time or through repeated\ningestion, so that even if the CBD oil met federal legal limits (i.e., 0.3 per cent), it would\nstill result in a positive urinalysis test result. Application of CBD oil use under either of\nthe situations covered in (2) or (3) could produce a favorable innocence result for\nApplicant based on a finding that he ingested a presumably legal product.  Conversely,\napplication of the situation covered (1) would not. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResolution of Applicant\u2019s innocence claims requires a credibility assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s personal denials of any knowing use of THC-laced CBD oil prior to his \npositive 2021 drug test that takes into all of the surrounding circumstances associated \nwith his positive test and claims of innocent use. In Applicant\u2019s case, potentially \nfavorable alternative explanations of his positive drug test are neither plausible nor \ncredible without more information from Applicant on the identity and sources of the CBD \noil he claims to have obtained and used prior to his June 2021 positive drug test for \nmarijuana.

More corroborating information from Applicant is \nneeded to reconcile his claims of innocent use with the positive test results for \nmarijuana he received in 2021 \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2011 and 2016, Applicant opened two consumer accounts exceeding \n$13,000 in the aggregate. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 25) Credit reports document that he defaulted in \nhis monthly payments on these two accounts in June 2022. He attributed these debts to \nhis difficulties in finding employment following his Army discharge in 2016.

These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Drug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds .  . . . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden\nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v.\nWashington Metro.

Important to keep in mind \nis the generally recognized fact that broad spectrum CBD oil can be expected to contain \nalmost no THC, while full spectrum CBD products can obtain up to 0.3 per cent of the \ningredient. In either situation, for Applicant to produce positive test results for marijuana \nfor what Applicant insists was CBD oil he ingested, reliable findings of CBD oil with THC \nlevels below the 0.3 per cent THC levels allowed the accepted minimum allowable in his \nsystem (and not marijuana) would be needed. \nPlausible explanations for the positive test results for marijuana in June 2021 are \nquite limited based on the evidence in the record. One possibility is Applicant\u2019s receipt \nof poor-quality CBD oil from an unlicensed retailer of CBD produced from a hemp plant \nby an unlicensed farm source containing THC content in excess of 0.3 percent. The \nother possibility is Applicant\u2019s receipt of marijuana from the same or other illegal source \nthat exceeded the recognized 50 ng/mL grace amount. Either occurring event places \nApplicant in violation of federal and state criminal laws controlling the use of THC-laced \nproducts in CBD and marijuana in Applicant\u2019s state of residence. Without convincing \nprobative proof of his innocent use of the CBD oil he claims was responsible for his \npositive drug test result, Applicant cannot satisfy his imposed evidentiary burden. \nUltimately, Applicant did not meet his evidentiary burden of proving he did not \nknow, or through reasonable inquiries could not have known that the CBD oil he \nobtained did not contain THC above the .03% limited set by the Farm Bill and endorsed \nin his home state of residence. Without more documented explanations from Applicant \non his good-faith efforts to ascertain the contents of the THC products he purchased \nbefore purchasing and using them, he failed to meet the evidentiary burden required to \nestablish his innocence under both Ruan requirements and the procedures prescribed \nby the Directive\u2019s procedural guidance for meeting an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with CBD \nand any other substances that could potentially place him at risk to testing positive for \nmarijuana.

Without more time to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence \nfrom the use of CBD oil and any other products that could potentially contain the \nprincipal marijuana ingredient (THC), none of the remaining mitigating conditions are \nfully available to Applicant at this time. With only two-plus years of elapsed time since \nhis 2021 positive drug test, additional time with more corroborating evidentiary sources \nto support his continued abstinence from CDC oil products that contain levels of THC \nbeyond the legally authorized limits approved by federal law, more evidence of \nsustained abstinence is needed from Applicant to facilitate safe predictions that he is no \nlonger a recurrence risk. Mitigation is not available to Applicant at this time. \nFinancial concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of two \ndelinquent debts exceeding $13,000. These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns.

Without more documented evicence from Applicant about \nhow he is addressing his individual delinquent SOR debts and his 2016-2017 tax \nreturns, favorable inferences cannot be drawn. \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information.

See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201dinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure to to file or fraudulently filing annual Ferderal, \nstate, or local income tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debt accumulations and tax filing lapses for tax \nyears 2016 and 2017, as alleged in the SOR, require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent accounts are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-\n00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd. June 29, 2016).  \nWithout any documented evidence of Applicant\u2019s addressing his delinquent debts \nand tax-filing lapses for tax years 2016-2017, none of the potentially available mitigating \nconditions are available to Applicant at this time. In the past, the Appeal Board has \nconsistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to provide documentation \ncorroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, whether the issues relate to \ntax, consumer, medical, or other debts and accounts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at \n4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of accumulation of delinquent debts and tax-filing \nlapses are fully compatible with minimum standards for holding a security clearance. \nWhile Applicant is entitled to credit for his contributions to the defense industry and the \nhigh school community he has served for many years, his efforts are not enough at this \ntime to overcome his repeated failures or inability to address his debt delinquencies \nand file his federal and state tax returns in a timely way, as required, over the course of \nmultiple years. Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been \nestablished. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for him to meet the requisite levels of stability \nwith his finances to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security clearance. I have \ncarefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person. I conclude financial considerations security concerns \nare not mitigated.

His friends \nwere using marijuana, and he wanted to feel involved. With the birth of his second child \nin 2014 and his relocation of his family to a state across the country late that year, he saw \nlittle of his camping friends with one exception. He used marijuana with that friend in 2015 \nand 2016. He used marijuana again one last time in December 2018. He has not used \nmarijuana in more than four years because he is a \u201cfamily man\u201d and is dedicated to \nworking hard to support his family. He also noted that he understands that using \nmarijuana is inconsistent with holding a security clearance and he no longer enjoys it. \n(Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 10, 32; Item 6 at 3.) \n1.b. Use of marijuana after submitting his 2012 SCA. Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana after he signed his 2012 e-QIP, as described above. He commented in his \n2012 e-QIP that he does not plan on using marijuana again. (Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 34; \nItem 5 at 3-4, 8.) \n1.c. Use of marijuana in December 2018 while holding a security clearance. \nApplicant was granted national security eligibility and a security clearance in about May \n2012. This allegation is focused solely on Applicant\u2019s one-time use in December 2018 \nwhile holding a security clearance. The reason for this limitation is unclear. In his e-QIP, \nApplicant wrote that his use of marijuana was \u201cvery infrequent\u201d and was \u201cless than once \na year at most\u201d during the past seven years (2013 to 2020). He also wrote in his e-QIP \nand in his Answer that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future because of his \nfamily responsibilities and his \u201crewarding career.\u201d In his Response, Applicant noted that \nhe intends \u201cto continue to abstain from all drug involvement and acknowledge[s] that any \nfuture involvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d He wrote that \nhis one-time use in 2018 at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in December of that year \u201cwas the \nlast time I ever used THC. He also wrote that the use of marijuana was \u201cnot an enjoyable \nexperience.\u201d He expressed his regret for \u201chis momentary lack of judgment\u201d \u201clate in the \nevening\u201d in which another person possessed the illegal drug. He also noted that he has \npromised his wife that he will never again take any action that might jeopardize his ability \nto support her and their two children. Applicant noted that he takes this promise very \nseriously. (Item 2 at 1, 2; Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 32; Item 6 at 4; Response at 4.) \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government cross-alleged the three allegations set forth in paragraph 1 of the \nSOR under the Personal Conduct guideline. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe admitted facts in this case establish both disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to provide mitigation of the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nAG \u00b6 26 includes two conditions in that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are \nused; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. \nThe record evidence establishes both of the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s past use of marijuana while holding a security clearance occurred so long ago \nand was so infrequent that it is unlikely to recur. His limited number of uses in which he \nwas offered puffs of marijuana by others last occurred more than four years ago. His past \nbehavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nHe has outgrown his prior errors in judgment, including his use of marijuana after \ncommitting to not use marijuana again in his 2012 e-QIP. \nIn addition, Applicant has acknowledged his past drug involvement with candor \nand openness. He has committed to abstain from using marijuana by promising his wife \nthat he will never again do anything to jeopardize his ability to support his family. He has \nalso promised himself that he will not jeopardize his career, which is important to him, by \nusing marijuana again. When he and his wife had their second child, they relocated across \nthe country to be near their families. Applicant is far away from his college environment \nand the college friends with whom he used to smoke marijuana on camping trips. He has \ncandidly admitted that he remains in contact with one close friend from his past, but that \nthere is no reason to believe that he cannot manage his relationship with that friend \nwithout using marijuana. Significantly, he has also signed his Response in which he \nformally committed to abstain from future drug involvement and acknowledged that and \nfuture involvement would be grounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility. \nApplicant has established mitigation of the security concerns raised by his past \nuse of marijuana before, and a few times after, being granted a security clearance. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s past use of marijuana after being granted a security clearance \nis certainly credible adverse information under the guideline for Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse. I have concluded that the record evidence does not \nsupport an adverse determination under that guideline. However, I also conclude \nthat his actions do not support application of the above-quoted potentially \ndisqualifying condition. As discussed below in my whole-person analysis, the \nrecord evidence does not support a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. While Applicant\u2019s actions from 2012 to 2018, \nraise such concerns, his abstention from illegal drug use since December 2018 \nand his candor in admitting all of his drug history support a favorable whole-person \nassessment. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use spans a number of years, but ceased \nafter December 2018, more than four years ago. I have considered Applicant\u2019s age in the \ncontext of his use of marijuana while in college and for several years after that, including \nhis infrequent (once-annual) use after committing in his 2012 e-QIP that he did not intend \nto use marijuana in the future. I have also taken into consideration Applicant\u2019s current \nstatus as a husband and father of two young children. In the past four years, he has \nshown by his abstention from illegal drugs, and by his complete candor during the security \nclearance application process, that he has matured and is a responsible professional with \na solid career ahead of him. There is little likelihood of recurrence of his use of illegal \ndrugs. He has mitigated the concerns raised by providing evidence of \u201cpermanent \nbehavioral changes\u201d with respect to his use of marijuana. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years-old. She has been married twice. She has two adult children. She separated from her second husband in December 2016. (Item 3 at 23.) She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. (Item 3 at 11.) Applicant lost her job in January 2017 and moved from outside the continental United States (OCONUS) to the continental United States (CONUS) to obtain work. (Item 2 at 5.) She obtained employment in April 2017 and remained with the company until February 2018. (Item 3 at 14.) Thereafter, until May 2018, she lists just March 2018 as a period of unemployment, when she was hired by her sponsor as a senior manufacturing planner. (Item 3 at 13-14.) Applicant\u2019s debts consist of a personal loan in a charged-off status; an unpaid deposit for an apartment application in collection; and the balance on a mortgage account 2 that is in foreclosure status. The three delinquent debts total over $73,800. She attributes the delinquent debts to separation from her husband, loss of employment, subsequent unemployment, and costs associated with moving to CONUS to obtain employment after losing her job.

Her efforts were further complicated by the hurricane that struck her \nlocation in September 2017. (Item 2 at 5.) Her husband filed for divorce in 2019 and for \nbankruptcy in 2021, which complicated the foreclosure action. (Item 2 at 5.) She cites the \nCOVID pandemic for disrupting normal services which prevented the foreclosure. (Item 2 \nat 5.) She offered in her Response a letter dated November 2, 2022, from her current \nmortgage holder denying her request for a modified payment plan on the basis the \nmodified payment would cause her debt-to-income ratio to exceed the program\u2019s \nguidelines.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThis case involves Applicant\u2019s inability to pay debts, arising from a series of life \nevents, the loss of employment, separation from her husband, and a geographical move. \nHer admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. The circumstances she claims triggered the \nlargest debts are unlikely to recur, but they are recent and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant lost her job in January 2017 and \nbecame estranged from her husband at about the same time. She was able to obtain \nemployment within a few months after her move. She does not support her claim that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve the personal loan or mortgage debt, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. She did not present any documentary evidence that she undertook \naction to resolve either delinquent account prior to completing her security clearance \napplication in May 2018. She acted on SOR \u00b6 1.a in December 2022, after receiving the \nSOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant provided evidence to support her \nassertion that she had made a good-faith effort to resolve the debts. She paid SOR \u00b6 1.b \ndespite a clear dispute to the validity of the debt. After receiving the SOR she acted on \nSOR \u00b6 1.a in December 2022, and after not being successful in other offers to resolve \nthe mortgage debt she states she is relying on foreclosure to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.c. She only \nbegan seriously to address the loan after receipt of the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 17-\n04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Her reliance upon foreclosure after receipt of the \nSOR does not equate to a good-faith effort to resolve her financial problem. Id. I conclude \nthat AG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established for the delinquent personal loan or mortgage. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n        \n \n          \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant  \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c: \n   Subparagraph 1.b: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

DOHA issued another notice on May 18, 2023, rescheduling the matter for a VTC \nhearing on June 14, 2023. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \nAt the hearing, I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12 and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through E, without objection. I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 13, \nan unauthenticated report of investigation summarizing two background interviews \nconducted by an authorized investigator in January 2022 and February 2022. At \nApplicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until July 12, 2023, so that he could submit \nadditional documentation. He timely submitted documentation that I marked collectively \nas AE F and admitted in evidence without objection. Since AE F contains only a two-page \nexcerpt from Applicant\u2019s July 2023 credit bureau report titled \u201cCollections,\u201d and not the \ncredit bureau report in its entirety, I will consider this in the weight that I give it. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript of the initial hearing on May 25, 2023 (Tr. 1) and of the \nsubsequent hearing on June 27, 2023 (Tr. 2). \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. He is 39 years old. \nHe married in 2012, divorced in 2018, and remarried in 2021. He has five minor children. \nHis eldest child is his ex-spouse\u2019s niece that they adopted from foster care during their \nmarriage; the next two children are from his first marriage; and the youngest two children \nare from his current marriage. He graduated from high school in 2012. He has owned his \nhome since 2014. (Tr. 2 at 24-25, 28, 35-36, 42, 67-77; GE 1, 10) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant has worked for his employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since July 2016. He began as a pipefitter and then he became a nationally \ncertified radiographer in October 2020. He was first granted a security clearance in 2018. \n(Tr. 1 at 5; Tr. 2 at 5-6, 24, 41-42, 87, 106) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 13 delinquent debts, totaling $23,898 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m) It also alleged that he had six judgments, totaling $11,073, entered against \nhim between June 2017 and February 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.s). The SOR allegations are \nestablished by his admissions in his Answer; his September 2021 security clearance \napplication (SCA); credit bureau reports from June 2016, December 2021, and \nSeptember 2022; and court records. (Answer; GE 1-12) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his April 2017 separation from his ex-\nspouse, his August 2018 divorce, and minimal income. At a date not in the record, a court \nordered that he and his ex-spouse share joint legal custody of their children but awarded \nher physical custody and ordered him to pay her $135 weekly in child support. At that \ntime, he earned $18 hourly as a pipefitter, and she earned approximately $20 hourly as \na pharmacy technician. In addition to paying for his living expenses and child support \nobligation, he was responsible for paying the mortgage.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts.

In light of the record evidence, I find the following: SOR \u00b6 1.b is \na duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.p; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.j, and 1.l are duplicates of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o; \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.r; and SOR \u00b6 1.f is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.s. In \naddition, Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. As such, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \n1.j, 1.l, and 1.m in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s position that he is not responsible for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nbecause the divorce decree ordered that he and his ex-spouse were responsible for their \nown debts, he co-signed on this auto loan during his marriage so that his then-spouse \ncould buy a car. This debt was reported on his 2021 credit bureau report, and he did not \nprovide documentation to show that he paid or otherwise resolved it. This debt is \nunresolved. He also did not provide documentation to show that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nwhich is reported on both his 2021 and 2022 credit bureau reports, is among the debts \nunderlying the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o. This debt is also unresolved. He also \ndid not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that he disputed the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k. Since he acknowledged that he did not pay them and they were \nreported on his 2022 credit bureau report, these debts are also unresolved. \nApplicant believed he was resolving his debts through wage garnishment when six \ngarnishment orders were entered against him beginning in 2018 and through 2021. \nThrough such orders, he paid the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.q in March 2021, before the SOR, \nand he paid the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.o in October 2022, and I therefore find these \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nallegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, the Appeal Board has long held that reliance on \ngarnishment or other involuntary means of debt resolution does not equate to a good-faith \nrepayment by the debtor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). \nAs of the date of the hearing, the wage garnishment for the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.p had just \nbegun, and the execution of the wage garnishment orders for the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.n, 1.r, and 1.s were pending. He had not made efforts to contact the creditors directly \nto resolve these debts. These debts are also unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s 2023 credit bureau report, which reflects a delinquent rental or leasing \naccount in collection for $1,115, reflects that his financial problems are ongoing. He has \nnot received financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has his \nfinances under control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was arrested at about 3:00 a.m. after police pulled him over for \nspeeding. He was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, which were all \nsuspended. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for a year. He claimed that, at that time, \nhe associated with a group of sailors who drank a lot and enjoyed going to bars and \nclubs. He claimed that he no longer associates with that group of people. He was \nrequired to attend State A\u2019s alcohol safety action program (ASAP).

Police administered him a breathalyzer test and the result\nindicated that he had a 0.17 percent blood alcohol content (BAC). He pleaded guilty to a\nlesser DUI offense and served 10 days in jail. He was placed on probation until 2013\nand his license was suspended for a year. His command gave him a Captain\u2019s Mast\nand the Navy out-processed him but allowed him to take full retirement based upon his \npast military record.

He also attended and \ncompleted an outpatient substance abuse program from September 2009 until January \n2010 and attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings intermittently from September \n2009 until September 2012. While he claimed that he was never told to abstain from \nalcohol, he did abstain from it from 2009 until 2014. He also claimed that he stopped \nassociating with the same crowd with whom he drank alcohol.

He claimed he would \nhave a drink or two at lunch or dinner. He claimed he drank about six to eight beers per \nmonth. During an August 2015 interview with a DOD investigator, Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he had modified his drinking habits by no longer drinking to the point of \nintoxication, and he no longer associated with the same crowd who liked to go out and \nparty. He also told the investigator that he did not foresee having additional DUIs. \nHowever, in June 2021, he was arrested in State B and charged with DUI, .16 (percent) \nor higher. Earlier that night, after working late, he had about five drinks over three-and-\na-half hours with dinner. Afterwards, he drove to a karaoke bar and drank more there. \nDespite drinking too much, he left the karaoke bar at about 3:30 a.m. to drive home, but \npolice pulled him over for driving erratically, speeding, and failing to use his turn signal. \nHe failed a field sobriety test and was given a breathalyzer. His breathalyzer test result \nindicated that he had a 0.16 percent BAC. The DUI charges were ultimately dismissed \nfor an alleged lack of evidence, but he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of careless \ndriving. He was required to pay a $400 fine. (Tr. 32-35, 61-65; Answer; GE 3-6) \nApplicant claimed that after his June 2021 arrest, he had a \u201creset,\u201d but he still \nconsumes alcohol and has a drink or two with dinner. He testified that he still drives \nafter consuming alcohol, but he does not drive if he has had more than one drink. He \nclaimed that if he has had more than one drink, his wife drives home from dinner. He \ntestified that he has not driven while intoxicated since June 2021 and that was the only \ntime he did so in the last 10 years. He claimed that his social circle now consists of \nmostly extended family who are not big drinkers or bargoers. He also claimed that he \ndrinks less because he has health issues that are exacerbated by drinking too much \nalcohol, he wants to keep his job, and he wants to have a healthy retirement. (Tr. 32-36, \n38-40, 66-69; Answer; GE 6) \nApplicant claimed he has not been diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an \nalcoholic. Applicant claimed that no alcohol counselor or medical professional has \nadvised him to stop drinking. On October 24, 2023, Applicant had a consultation with a \ncounselor who holds a master\u2019s degree in counseling education and is a licensed \nprofessional counselor. After this consultation, the counselor diagnosed Applicant with \nAlcohol Use, Mild, in sustained remission. He then underwent at least one other session \nwith the same counselor. The counselor made no recommendation regarding Applicant \nabstaining from alcohol. (Tr. 31, 75-76; AE C) \nWhile he was in the Navy, Applicant earned the Meritorious Service Award, \nwhich he claimed is not normally awarded to an enlisted servicemember. He deployed \nto a combat zone for about ten months beginning in October 2007. He retired from the \nNavy as an E-8, which is the second highest enlisted pay grade available. He has \nreceived praise from his supervisors and customers regarding his work performance. \nHis colleagues, friends, and family have written character-reference letters advocating \nthat he be awarded a security clearance and attesting to his good character, \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and patriotism. His spouse also wrote that she does not think \nhe has a problem with alcohol and that he is merely a social drinker. In contravention of \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, she claimed that he does not drive after he has been drinking. \n(Tr. 24-25, 36-37; Answer; AE A, B) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in 2004, 2009, and 2021 after \ndrinking too much and deciding to drive. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions \nare established and the burden shifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nOn at least three occasions over a span of about 17 years, Applicant has \nconsumed far too much alcohol, made the decision to drive, and been arrested for DUI. \nAlthough it has been about two years since Applicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related \narrest, his pattern of problematic impaired driving, with gaps of five to eight years in \nbetween incidents, casts doubt on whether these incidents are likely to recur. Moreover, \nhe continues to drive after drinking. He claimed that he has modified his alcohol intake \nand no longer associates with people who drink a lot; however, he made these claims \nprior to his latest DUI. For these reasons, he has not met his burden to show that the \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. He also has not met his burden of showing that he has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \n23(b), and 23(d) do not apply. \nApplicant went to a treatment or counseling program, but he subsequently drove \nafter drinking too much and was again arrested for DUI. AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. \nApplicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy, honorable military service, his deployment, his positive character \nevidence, and his good employment record. However, I find that the totality of the \nevidence, including his DUIs, his willingness to continue to drink and drive, and his \nfailed efforts to effectively modify his alcohol consumption in the past leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nI conclude Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

His spouse was born in Colombia and is a citizen of Colombia and the \nUnited States and a resident of the United States.

For each of the seven \ndelinquent accounts, he recited as a reason his above explanation for his one year of \nunemployment. To that explanation, he added that he let the accounts be charged off or \ngo into collection \u201cas an act of desperation on our part . . . [and in] hindsight I do regret \nmaking bad judgment to do that.\u201d For all but one account, he stated \u201cI am in the process \nof resolving this debt.\u201d For SOR \u00b6 1.e, he stated that it was paid in full on June 11, 2021. \n(Ex. 3.) With his Answer, he submitted a document showing that four of the SOR accounts \nhave been enrolled with a debt relief agency. That document does not show that those \naccounts (which includes SOR \u00b6 1.e) have been resolved.

His son was born prematurely on December 19, 2013. \nAs a result, his son was in a neonatal care unit from December 2013 to September 2014. \nHe began to work part time so he could spend time with his son in the hospital. He incurred \ndebts and living expenses that his part-time paycheck could not cover. His debts became \ndelinquent when he and his wife went to Colombia in March 2017 to seek medical \ntreatment for his daughter (then five years old) who was autistic. Her medical treatments \nleft very little money to pay bills. He is currently seeking help from a credit counseling and \nconsolidation agency and intends to pay his overdue bills. (Ex. 5.) \nGuideline B. Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s: (1) spouse is \na dual citizen of Colombia and the United States; (2) spouse owns property in Colombia \nwith an approximate value of $50,000; and (3) mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and brother-\nin-law are citizens and residents of Colombia. (Ex. 1.) Applicant admitted the first \nallegation but said that his spouse last visited Colombia in April 2019 and does not travel \nthere regularly. He admitted the second allegation but said his spouse only made a down \npayment of $20,000. He admitted the third allegation. (Ex. 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s last trip to Colombia was in 2017. The investigation disclosed \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with Colombia and with his Colombian mother-in-law, brother-in-law, \nand sister-in-law. His mother-in-law is a homemaker. She is not employed outside of the \nhome. She has no connections with the Colombian government, its military, or any \nbusiness or entity owned by the Colombian government. His spouse is in telephonic or \nvideo chats with her mother about weekly. He also participates briefly in those \ncommunications. (Exs. 4 and 5.) \nApplicant\u2019s Colombian brother-in-law and sister-in-law are employed by the same \nself-owned software company. They have no connections with the Colombian \ngovernment, military, or any business or entity owned by the Colombian government. He \nand his spouse speak to those in-laws by telephone about weekly. None of his in-laws \nreceive financial support from Applicant; nor does he receive any financial support from \nthem. (Ex. 4 and 5.)  \nApplicant explained his spouse\u2019s ownership of real property in Colombia. The \nproperty was purchased in 2021. It is not important to his overall financial situation. It was \npurchased to have as a place to vacation when he retires. He is still making payments to \nown the home. He is not vulnerable to foreign influence because of the property. He plans \nto maintain ownership, because he wants to keep the property as a vacation home for \nretirement. It is not in his name; it is in his spouse\u2019s name, and her funds were used to \nmake a down payment. His earnings were not used for the purchase of the property. (Ex. \n4.) Applicant was asked why he purchased this property having unpaid debts. He \nanswered that it was an investment for the future. (Ex. 5.) \nGuideline E.

He failed to notify his supervisor, because he had to rush to the emergency \nroom (ER) with his son (then three years old). Now he sends a quick text if he is going to \nmiss work. His supervisor is aware of this incident. (Ex. 5.) \nThe second incident was in April 2019. He was issued a written warning for failure \nto comply with management for not completing training within the regular time frame. He \nagrees with this information.

Of note is \nthat Colombia is one of the oldest democracies in Latin America. The United States is \nColombia\u2019s largest trading partner. Colombia has been plagued by transnational criminal \nand narcotics trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and armed criminal gangs. \nColombia also continues to have human rights problems. Any person born in Colombia \nmay be considered a Colombian citizen, and dual U.S.- Colombian citizens are required \nto present a Colombian passport to enter and exit Colombia. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Having reviewed all of the mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20, \nI find only the following potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts became \ndelinquent between November 2017 and July 2019. That is not that long ago. And they \nwere not infrequent. They remain delinquent today. I find that AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two elements. First, \nthe applicant\u2019s financial problems must be caused by conditions \u201clargely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control.\u201d Second, the person must \u201chave acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s decision to travel to Colombia to seek medical treatment for \nhis daughter who suffered from autism was understandable. Her condition was largely \nbeyond his controI, thus satisfying the first element of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly in light of the \nconsequences of his decision to go to Colombia to seek treatment. Those consequences \nwere unemployment and an increase in expenses. Faced with those consequences, he \nelected to let his household accounts go into collections or be charged off. He candidly \nadmitted that his choice was not responsible and was \u201cbad judgment\u201d that he regrets. I \nagree. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant has enrolled four of \nhis SOR debts in a debt relief program. And he has sought credit counseling. That is a \ngood start. He earns partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) for those efforts. He has not yet, \nhowever, shown a track record of resolving any of his debts. The Appeals Board has \nrequired an applicant to show a track of paying or otherwise resolving debts beyond just \nenrolling in a debt relief program or getting financial counseling. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 20-01510 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2021), citing ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. \nBd. Sep. 18, 2015). Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply in full. For the same reason, \nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the\nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government contends that AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (f) apply. Applicant has three \nrelatives by marriage who are citizens and residents of Colombia, his mother-in-law, his \nbrother-in-law, and his sister-in-law. His mother-in-law is a homemaker. His brother and \nsister-in-law work for the same privately owned software firm. None of those relatives \nhave any connections to the Colombian government or military. His last visit to Colombia \nwas in 2017 to seek treatment for his daughter. His spouse last visited Colombia in 2019. \nNeither he nor his spouse regularly visit Colombia. His spouse speaks with her relatives \nabout weekly by telephone, and he sometimes participates. He does not receive any \nfinancial support from his in-laws. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b is directed at the property Applicant\u2019s spouse owns in Colombia. He \nadmitted that ownership and its approximate value of $50,000. He added that his spouse \npaid the $20,000 down payment. Thus, the balance is about $30,000. He also stated that \nthe property was purchased in his spouse\u2019s name. Her funds, not his, were used for the \npurchase. \nI also considered that Applicant could liquidate that property to resolve his debts \nin the United States. I discounted that for three reasons. First, he stated that it was an \ninvestment in the future as a home for retirement or vacations. Second, he stated that the \nproperty is not important to his overall financial situation. Courts routinely permit \nindividuals to testify about the financial significance of their assets. See, e.g., Sabal Trail \nTransmission LLC v. 3921 Acres of Land, 947 F. 3d 1362, 1368-69 (11th Cir. 2020). \nFinally, he has enrolled his SOR debts in a credit relief program and has sought financial \ncounseling. He is addressing his financial difficulties. I find that the property is not a \n\u201csubstantial . . . property interest.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, and his spouse\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are citizens \nand residents of Colombia. His spouse owns property in Colombia. Applicant intends to \nkeep that property for vacations or as a retirement home. Colombia has been plagued by \ntransnational criminal and narcotics trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and \narmed criminal gangs. Colombia also continues to have human rights problems. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and \nthrough his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) have been implicated by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Colombia. Colombia has significant \nproblems, but it is also one of the oldest democracies in Latin America.

AG \u00b6 8(a) is \napplicable. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to Guideline E for personal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges three workplace infractions, two that resulted in written warnings \nand one that resulted in a written violation with a one-day penalty of work without pay. \nThose infractions were in 2017 and 2019. Applicant admitted those infractions. \nDepartment Counsel observes that the first two infractions are \u201cnot overly concerning.\u201d I \nconcur. Applicant provided credible explanations for those, an absence due to a trip to \nthe ER for his son and missing a training he did not think he was scheduled for. These \nfirst two infractions were de minimis in nature. \nThe third incident involved Applicant\u2019s failure to follow appropriate procedures for \nchecking tools in and out of the workplace. Department Counsel characterizes this as an \naccusation of theft. But Applicant claims he was falsely accused and that changes have \nsince been made. I do not characterize the incident as something as nefarious as theft, \nbut it was a violation. \nThe SOR does not specify which disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16 applies. \nDepartment Counsel argues that because Applicant did not disclose these three incidents \nin his SCA or in his interrogatory responses, this shows a \u201cpattern of rules violations.\u201d \nFORM at 4. That would trigger AG \u00b6 16(d)(3): \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d \nBut the SOR does not allege facts supporting that disqualifying condition. The \u201cpattern\u201d \nmust include the first two incidents, which were de minimis. Therefore, the \u201cpattern\u201d is an \nallegation not asserted in the SOR. Nor does the SOR allege a deliberate failure to \ndisclose the three incidents. Unalleged conduct cannot be an independent basis for a \ndenial. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Thus, Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to disclose the three incidents and the pattern those incidents might portray cannot \nbe grounds for a denial.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that the security concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, have not been mitigated. I conclude that there are no established \nGuideline B, foreign influence, concerns and that security concerns under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct, have not been established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 g.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a. \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 c.: \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 31 years old. Record evidence reflects that he was engaged to be married in late 2021 and has no children. He graduated college in 2014. Shortly afterwards, he obtained employment as a software engineer and has since been consistently employed. He has been with his current employer as a software engineer since 2021.

Although Applicant resides in a state where \nmarijuana is legal, he acknowledged his awareness that marijuana was illegal under \nfederal law. Still, Applicant stated that he intends to continue using marijuana in the \nfuture because he \u201cenjoys the autonomy to smoke\u201d even though he claimed to not like \nmarijuana.

As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). The current National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, 2017, after the 2014 DNI memo was \nissued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The \nmemo incorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) \namong various other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency. \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (The 2021 DNI memo cites Guideline H, \nalleged in this case, and the AGs for personal conduct and criminal conduct, Guidelines \nE and J, not alleged in this case). Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs \nindicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nAn applicant's use of illegal drugs after having completed a security clearance \napplication or after otherwise having been placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug \nabuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her judgment, reliability, \nand willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).

See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-00540 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2019). \nApplicant began using marijuana when he started college in 2010. He continued \nusing marijuana after graduating college in 2014. He stated in his June 2021 SCA that \nhe would terminate his marijuana use in order to hold a security clearance. However, he \ncontinued using marijuana as recently as July 2021. During his September 2021 \nbackground interview, Applicant acknowledged his awareness that marijuana was illegal \nunder federal law but stated his intent to continue using marijuana anyway. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(g) both apply. \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was both recent and frequent. He initially used \nmarijuana in 2010 and stopped only for a brief period in 2016 when he experienced bad \nanxiety and paranoia from his use. Still, despite his claims that he does not like \nmarijuana, he resumed using marijuana for years and continued after he submitted his \nSCA in 2021. In his September 2021 background interview, he stated his intent to \ncontinue using marijuana and admitted this intent in his Answer to the SOR. I find that \nApplicant has shown a history of conduct that is of a security significance. Further, he \nhas chosen to continue this conduct by continuing his drug use. The circumstances and \nextent of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use preclude application of mitigation under either AG \u00b6 \n26(a) or AG \u00b6 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

(Item 3 at pages 5 and \n20.) \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse & Guideline E - Personal \nConduct \n1.a.~1.e., and 2.a. Applicant admits that he used the following illegal substances: \nmarijuana with varying frequency from 2010 through August 2018; cocaine with varying \nfrequency from 2014 through August 2018; psilocybin mushrooms with varying \nfrequency from 2012 through August 2013; NDMA (Ecstasy) on three occasions from \n2012 through 2014; and LSD on two occasions in 2013. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n2.b.

Applicant admits that he willfully falsified his December 2021 e-QIP by failing \nto disclose his above mentioned marijuana and cocaine abuse. \n2.d. and 2.e. Applicant admits that he willfully falsified material facts during his \ninterviews with DoD investigators in February and again in March of 2022. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used marijuana, cocaine, psilocybin mushrooms, MDMA (Ecstasy), \nand LSD. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6\u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply, as Applicant\u2019s misuse of illegal substances is fairly recent. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant falsified his December 2021 e-QIP, and was not candid with \ninvestigators in his subsequent interviews. He also used illegal substances, and was \nconvicted for his drug misuse. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nNone of these are applicable. His repeated falsifications were willful and fairly \nrecent. Applicant also has a drug abuse problem. Personal Conduct is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on August 5, 2022, and August 22, \n2022, and she requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on April 28, 2023.

She is 40 years old, married, and she \nhas one adult child and one minor child. She earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2013, and a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 2015. She has lived with her family in a rental property in state A since \n2019. (Tr. at 8, 22, 47-49; GE 1, 5) \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. military from 2002 to 2008. Due to her \nattending school and caring for her children, she was subsequently unemployed until \nDecember 2014. She then worked as a U.S. Government civilian employee overseas, \nwhere her spouse was stationed as an active-duty military member, until April 2019. Due \nto her recovery following a major surgery and her family\u2019s relocation to the United States, \nshe was again unemployed until December 2019. Since then, she has remained \nemployed by various DOD contractors. She has worked for her current employer as an \ninformation technology project manager since December 2022. She was first granted a \nsecurity clearance when she served in the U.S. military. (Tr. at 5, 9-10, 22-30, 49-51; GE \n1, 5) \nAs of the date the SOR was issued, Applicant had three credit-card accounts in \ncollection status (SOR \u00b6\u00b6  1.a, 1.b, and 1.c), in the amounts of $25,295, $5,458, and \n$4,463, respectively. All three debts were reported on her 2021 and 2022 credit bureau \nreports. Only two debts were reported on her 2023 credit bureau report, which reflected \nthe following notations for each debt: (1) \u201cConsumer Disputes \u2013 Reinvestigation in \nProgress\u201d for SOR \u00b6 1.a; and (2) \u201cConsumer Disputes \u2013 Reinvestigation in Progress, \nCharged Off Account, Account Closed by Credit Grantor\u201d for SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Answer; GE 1-\n5)  \nIn her SCA, Applicant reported that all three credit-card accounts were charged off \ndue to nonpayment. She stated that she stopped making monthly payments on the \naccounts after she reported all three credit cards as \u201clost or stolen\u201d in May 2017. She also \nstated that the three debts resulted from unauthorized charges made on the cards, of \nwhich she had not been aware, after she reported them lost or stolen. During her \nNovember 2021 background interview, she told the investigator that the three debts \nresulted from the unknown and unauthorized charges made on the cards after she \nreported them lost or stolen, and the high interest rates that continued to accrue on the \noutstanding balances. She maintained that she did not learn about her delinquent credit \ncards until approximately May 2021. In her Answer, Applicant asserted that the three \ndebts resulted from her being a victim of identity theft.

She\nmaintained that she lost her wallet, which contained the three credit cards and her military\nidentification card, during a vacation cruise she took with her family in the summer of\n2017. She did not report her lost wallet to the cruise ship authorities because she did not\nlose it aboard the ship. She did not think to file a police report with the local authorities.\nShe did not immediately contact her creditors because she did not have any phone or\ninternet service aboard the ship. When she returned from vacation less than one week\nlater, she reported her lost wallet and military identification card to the authorities on the\nU.S. military base where she resided. She also contacted her creditors to report her lost\nwallet and close the accounts. She did not provide documentation to corroborate her\ntestimony.

She claimed that she continued making \npayments toward the balances she incurred on all three accounts after they were closed, \nand until they were each paid in full. She stopped monitoring the three accounts once she \nbelieved that each was paid in full. She denied any knowledge of the unauthorized \ncharges made on each of the credit cards after she reported them lost, in the amounts of \n$10,000, $3,500, and $4,500, for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, respectively. She believed \nthat the charges may have gone through because the accounts were not closed when \nshe believed them to have been closed. The credit bureau reports corroborated that she \nmade payments through April 2018 and August 2019 for the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a and 1.b, respectively. (Tr. at  30-43, 45-46, 49-69) \nAt the hearing, Applicant attributed her lack of knowledge about the delinquent \naccounts to having not received any correspondence about them from any of the \ncreditors, due, in large part, to her family\u2019s relocation from their residence overseas to the \nUnited States. Although she had been monitoring her credit using Credit Karma for an \nunspecified period, the three credit card accounts were not reported as delinquent until \nabout 2021 to 2022. She claimed that she had been working with the creditors and major \ncredit reporting agencies to settle or otherwise resolve these debts and have them \nremoved from her credit report. She also placed a security freeze on her credit reports. \n(Answer; Tr. at 30-43, 45-46, 49-69; GE 1, 5) \nApplicant also claimed that, in the summer of 2022, she began working with and \npaying $120 monthly to a credit counseling company, who was assisting her with \ndisputing the three debts and cleaning up her credit report. She maintained that, although \nshe had the financial means to settle and resolve these debts, she had not yet discussed \nthis option with the credit counseling company as of the date of the hearing. She \npreviously believed, based on her own research, as well as information told to her by the \ncredit counseling company, that she was not responsible for paying the three debts since \nthey had been charged off and would eventually fall off her credit report. However, she \nhas since learned that she was mistaken in that belief and has accepted full responsibility \nfor repaying all three debts. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant provided undated documentation reflecting that she enrolled all three \ndebts into a debt relief program with another company. She agreed to pay $514 monthly, \nfrom which the company would make payments to settle these debts on her behalf by \nJune 2027, with the projected next settlement to occur between December 2023 and \nFebruary 2024. She did not provide any documentary evidence that she had commenced \nher payments, or that any of three debts had yet been settled or otherwise resolved \nthrough the program. (Answer; Tr. at 30-43, 45-46, 49-69; GE 1-5; AE A) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant earned $135,000 annually. She also \nreceived $2,400 monthly for her 90% disability rating from the U.S. Department of \nVeterans Affairs. She had approximately $4,000 in her bank accounts and $20,000 in her \nretirement savings account. Her spouse expected to retire from the U.S. military in \nSeptember 2023, after 23 years of service, and he intended to obtain employment in the \nprivate sector. She estimated that he earned $100,000 annually. They maintain separate \nfinances, but they share responsibility for paying the household expenses. She stated \nthat the credit counseling company provided her with credit counseling. The credit reports \ndo not list any other delinquent debts. An individual who has known Applicant personally \nand professionally for over 15 years, and for whom Applicant worked as a subcontractor \nafter her discharge from the U.S. military, attested to Applicant\u2019s character, integrity, and \nresponsibility. (Tr. at 23-29, 44-49; GE 1, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying her debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant proffered a reasonable basis to dispute the unauthorized charges on her \ncredit card accounts after she reported the credit cards lost, and the credit bureau reports \ncorroborate her efforts to resolve the dispute. However, there remains substantial \nunresolved debt for which she accepted responsibility. She provided conflicting \ninformation about the reason for her delinquent credit cards. As such, it is not clear that \ncircumstances beyond her control contributed to her financial problems. Even if I were to \ngive her the benefit of the doubt, AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that she provide evidence that she \nacted responsibly under her circumstances. She failed to do so. \nApplicant did not provide any documentation showing: (1) any payments she made \ntoward the outstanding balances she incurred on the credit cards before they were lost; \nor (2) any efforts she made either to resolve or to dispute the debts with the creditors and \ncredit bureau agencies once she learned that they were outstanding sometime in 2021 \nor 2022. She also did not corroborate any claims of payments she made to the first credit \ncounseling company she engaged in the summer of 2022, or to the second company she \nengaged at a date not in the record. She has not yet made any payments toward her \ndebts, despite having the financial means to do so. \nApplicant has not established that she has her finances under control. Given the \nrecord before me, I find that her delinquent debts continue to cast doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) are not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

(Item 2.) In his \nAnswer, Applicant admitted the four SOR allegations under Guideline E and provided a \npersonal statement. On January 10, 2023, Department Counsel submitted the \nDepartment\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nconsisting of Items 1 to 8, was provided to Applicant, who received the file on February \n6, 2023. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to raise objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He did not submit any additional \ninformation. The case was assigned to me on March 29, 2023. Based upon a review of \nthe pleadings, the Government\u2019s exhibits, as well as Department Counsel\u2019s arguments \nset forth in the FORM, national security eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old and married.

(Item 4 at \nSections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25.) \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR sets forth four allegations under the Personal Conduct guideline. The \nGovernment alleges that Applicant has engaged in questionable conduct starting in 2008, \nand most recently in 2021, that involved an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations raising concerns about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. The four allegations and supporting record evidence \nare summarized below: \n1.a. February 2008 Arrest. Applicant was arrested in 2008 and charged with \nDriving Under the Influence (DUI) as a Minor. (Item 3 at 37.) \n1.b. July 2013 Arrest. Applicant was arrested again in 2013 and charged with DUI \nwith a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.15% or more. This arrest occurred within six months of \nApplicant starting his job with a DOD contractor and being granted a security clearance. \nIn July 2014 he plead guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which \nwas suspended. He was also placed on probation for 18 months and fined, and he was \nordered to complete 40 hours of community service, 12 hours of a DUI education course, \nand a meeting of a local Victim Impact Panel. He was further ordered to abstain from \ndrinking alcohol during the term of his probation, to submit to random testing for alcohol, \nand to have an ignition-interlock device installed on his vehicle.

On November 20, 2014, Applicant was ordered to complete Supportive \nOutpatient Substance Abuse treatment and all recommended aftercare. He had \npreviously tested positive for alcohol. This condition was added by the court on the \nrecommendation of the probation office supervising Applicant\u2019s probation. On January 8, \n2016, Applicant\u2019s period of probation was extended six months to July 10, 2016, to \nprovide Applicant with additional time to complete the terms and conditions of his \nprobation. On April 15, 2016, Applicant probation terms were amended to add a \nrequirement that he complete \u201ca cognitive program\u201d within 90 days. (Item 4 at 6-8.) \n1.c. July 2016 Arrest Warrant. Applicant failed to abide by the terms of his \nprobation and the state moved the court to revoke his probation and impose the \nsuspended sentence of 120 days. The prosecutor\u2019s motion recites that Applicant only \nperformed half of his 40 hours of community service, failed to participate in an outpatient \nsubstance abuse treatment program, and tested positive for alcohol on at least two \noccasions, once in 2014 and again in 2015. The court issued a warrant for Applicant\u2019s \narrest. (Item 5 at 1-2; Item 7 at 2.) \n1.d. January 2021 Revocation of Probation. In July 2020 Applicant learned about \nthe arrest warrant. He turned himself into the county sheriff and was arrested. He \nappeared in court on October 2, 2020, and he was released on a $1,000 bond. His \nprobation was continued. He was given a new court date of January 21, 2021. At the \nJanuary hearing, the court revoked Applicant\u2019s original probationary sentence and \nimposed a sentence of confinement for 11 days in the county jail, commencing on \nFebruary 4, 2021, and a fine. (Item 6; Item 7 at 2.) \nApplicant failed to timely report his 2013 DUI arrest to the security officer at his \nemployer. He also failed to report his arrest in July 2020 for violating his probation and \nhis October 2020 court appearance. He ultimately reported his criminal history to his \nemployer on November 16, 2020. He updated his history in a second report in February \n2021. (Item 7 at 1-2.) \nApplicant noted in his Answer that he has learned from his past mistakes. He wrote \nthat he had married, and the couple had purchased their first home as evidence of his \nmaturity. He also commented that he loves his work and highly respects the service \nmembers he supports at his employment. (Item 2 at 1.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established by Applicant\u2019s two arrests for DUI and his repeated failure \nto comply with the terms and conditions of his probation, which resulted in the issuance \nof an arrest warrant in July 2016, his arrest on the warrant in July 2020, and his jail \nsentence in January 2021. \nAG \u00b6 17 contains seven conditions that can mitigate security concerns raised by \nan applicant\u2019s personal conduct. The following condition potentially applies to the facts of \nthis case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe facts in this case do not support application of the above mitigating condition. \nThe underlying DUI offense is not minor and Applicant\u2019s repeated refusal to comply with \nthe terms of his probation over a period of years raises concerns that his failure to abide \nby rules and regulations, in this case, specific court orders and probation terms and \nconditions, is serious. Additional personal misconduct is likely to recur.

The administrative judge should \nconsider the following nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the \nwhole-person factors listed above in light of all pertinent facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s failure to comply with the terms of his probation is \nserious misconduct, which continued over a number of years. He has provided no \nsignificant evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral changes. In fact, Applicant \nfailed to timely self report to his employer his 2013 DUI arrest, his conviction and probation \nin July 2014, and his July 2020 arrest on a warrant for failure to comply with his probation. \nHis failure to self-report these incidents is evidence of a lack of rehabilitation. He remains \npotentially vulnerable to pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. The likelihood of \nrecurrence of his past immature and irresponsible behavior is significant. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 - Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

He denied the factual allegations \nin Paragraph 4 of the SOR, with explanation. \nApplicant is 49 years old, twice divorced, and has three children, two of whom \nare adults. He has worked for a defense contractor since June of 2018. (GX 1 at pages \n7, 12, 18~20 and 22~23.). \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuae \n1.a. Applicant admits that he used marijuana, about once or twice a month from \nabout 1996 until his last usage in about July of 2015. In 2015, about eight years ago, \nApplicant found out that he had a \u201cheart disease;\u201d and as a result, stopped using \nmarijuana. (TR at page 16 line 4 to page 17 line 22.) \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n2.b. Applicant has paid his 2015 Federal income tax debt through an \u201cOnline \nAccount\u201d by two payments: $1,000 in April of 2022, and $4,074 in August of 2023. This \nis evidenced by a document from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (PHX A.) On \nAugust 1, 2023, Applicant also filed his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 \nand 2017, as evidenced by those filings. (PHXs C and D.) He has also submitted \ndocumentation from the IRS showing that Applicant owes \u201c$0.00\u201d for tax years \n2017~2022. (PHX B.) \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \n3.a. Applicant admits that in August of 2015, about eight years ago, he was found \nto be in Contempt of Court during a child custody battle with his second wife. When \nasked if he was using drugs, which his former spouse alleged, Applicant averred \u201cno,\u201d \nsince Applicant had previously ceased any marijuana usage due to his heart condition. \nHowever, he tested \u201cpositive\u201d as a result of his past marijuana usage. (TR at page 18 \nline 18 to page 20 line 6.) As a result, Applicant was sentenced to seven days of \nconfinement for Contempt. \n3.b.

Applicant admits that in December of 2019, about four years ago, he was \narrested and charged with being an \u201cunlicensed driver\u201d in State B, which had \nsuspended his State B driver\u2019s license as a result of his 2018 DUI arrest. (AppX A.) \nAlthough he had moved to State B, he was still using his previous valid State A driver\u2019s \nlicense. (TR at page 21 line 14 to page 24 line 21.) \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \n4.a. As a result of his July 2018 DUI, noted above in subparagraph 3.b., \nApplicant no longer drives after drinking alcohol. (TR at page 30 line 22 to page 31 line \n14.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used marijuana, about once or twice a month from about 1996 until his \nlast usage in about July of 2015. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s last marijuana usage was over eight years ago, and because of his \nheart disease he no longer uses marijuana. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is \nfound for Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case:  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 and \n2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has filed his delinquent Federal income tax returns, and is current with \nthe IRS. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial Considerations is \nfound for Applicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has two convictions offorontempt of Court in 2015, and DUI in 2018. He \nwas also arrested for being an Unlicensed Driver in 2019. This evidence raises security \nconcerns under these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant \nto rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains two conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has passed, nearly four years, since Applicant\u2019s 2019 motor \nvehicle code violation: and more than five years since his July 2018 conviction. Criminal \nConduct is found for Applicant. \nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. One condition may apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder. \nApplicant committed and was convicted of a DUI in 2018. This evidence raises \nthe above security concern, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, \nor mitigate that concern. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One conditions may apply: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment.  \nApplicant no longer drives after drinking alcohol. His DUI occurred more than five \nyears ago, and he has complied with all the court-ordered DUI programs. Alcohol \nConsumption is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.

He has worked as an \naerospace technician for a government contractor for the last two years. His SCA shows \nthat he has been consistently employed since 2008. This is his first application for a \nsecurity clearance. (Item 4) \nThe SOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling $31,240. The status of the debts \nis as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an auto loan placed in collection for $22,321. The credit report shows \nthat it is now charged-off, and that he opened this loan in 2013. Applicant admitted the \ndebt and stated that it was the result of an auto accident in 2016. He reported that he was \nin the process of changing his auto insurance when he had the accident, and he was \nliable for paying the loan balance of the car that he wrecked. He stated that he stopped \nmaking payments on the loan in 2016. He claims that the lender offered him a settlement \nagreement, but he did not have the money at the time to accept it. He admitted that his \ninitial plan was to ignore the debt until it dropped off his credit report, but he came to \nrealize that it was important to resolve to rehabilitate his credit score. He claimed that he \nis saving money so that he can make a payoff offer. This debt is unresolved. (Answer; \nItems 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d are student loans placed in collection totaling $6,305. The credit \nreport shows that the loans were opened in 2014 and 2015, and the date of last activity \nwas November 2015. On his SCA, he reported taking classes at a technical school in \n2014. Applicant admitted the debts and stated that he planned to apply for loan \nforgiveness. If he does not get loan forgiveness, he plans to establish a payment plan. \nThese debts are unresolved. (Answer; Items 4, 5, 6, 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is an account placed in collection for $1,405. The credit report shows \nthat it is a rental agreement that is now charged-off, which was opened in 2019, and the \ndate of last activity was in 2020. Applicant denied this debt and claimed that it was paid. \nHe claimed that he made a lump-sum payment on this debt in 2021 but did not provide \nany documentation supporting his assertion.

These debts are unresolved. \n(Answer; Items 5, 6)  \nIn his January 2022 background interview with a government investigator, he \nclaimed that his monthly net income is about $7,500, and his monthly expenses are about \n$5,480. He was unsure about what happened to his monthly surplus. He reported that he \ndid not have a monthly budget, but he planned to make one. He stated that he did not \nintend to have delinquent debt. He asserted that he was trying to live within his means, \nand help people before himself. (Item 5)   \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant did not provide any documentation concerning his \ncurrent financial situation, such as his monthly income and expenses, and his assets. He \nprovided no evidence that he has received credit counseling. Since 2018, he has taken \nfour international vacations, once to Mexico and three times to Costa Rica. (Items 4, 5). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR allegations evidencing Applicant\u2019s history of financial delinquencies are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions, his background interview, and the credit reports \nin the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence showing \nthat any of the SOR debts are resolved or being paid, or that they became delinquent \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur. He also failed to provide sufficient \ndocumentation of his current financial situation, evidence which might establish his ability \nto address his debts responsibly. His failure to pay his delinquent debt is recent, ongoing, \nand not isolated. His failure to meet his financial obligations continues to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (e) could potentially apply to SOR\u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.h. However, Applicant \ndid not provide sufficient documentation of payment arrangements, payments made, or \nefforts made to dispute the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d) and (e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Applicant did not provide \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the security concerns arising out of his delinquent debts \nunder Guideline F. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He attended college for a period, but he has not \nearned a degree. He married in 2016 and divorced in 2020. He has one child. (Tr. at 17-\n18, 22; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1) \n \nApplicant developed financial problems as a result of his divorce. The amended \nSOR alleges eight delinquent debts totaling about $23,000. The debts are listed on one \nor more credit reports from July 2021, March 2022, January 2023, and August 2023. \n(Tr. at 14, 18; GE 2-5) \nApplicant accepts responsibility for his financial issues. He borrowed from his \nfather to pay his attorney for his divorce. Applicant paid this loan and two car loans that \nwere not alleged in the SOR, but he has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nHe testified that he would pay his debts if the creditors would work with him. He has not \nreceived financial counseling. He asserted that he loves his job, and his finances would \nnot cause him to do anything to harm this country.

This will help resolve that \nportion of collection on my credit report and put me in a better position \ncredit wise. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorce. That qualifies as an \nevent that was beyond his control. To receive the benefit of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must also \nprove that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He testified that he \nwould pay his debts if the creditors would work with him. It is difficult to accept that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant could not find a single creditor to take his money. One creditor obtained a \ngarnishment order against him. However, court-ordered or otherwise involuntary means \nof debt resolution, such as garnishment, are entitled to less weight than means initiated \nand carried through by the debtor himself. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Additionally, intentions to pay debts in the future are not a \nsubstitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will \npay his debts. There is insufficient evidence for a determination that his financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \nNone of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. I find that financial considerations \nsecurity concerns remain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comment, the single allegation of drug involvement (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 49-year-old systems engineering manager sponsored by a successive defense contractor since January 2021. He graduated from high school in June 1992, and subsequently enrolled in a full-time university program of study in August 1992. He completed the program in May 1996 and was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He continued his education in August 1998 and was awarded a master\u2019s degree in May 2004. Applicant married in November 2003, and divorced in about April 2007. He does not have children. (Items 2 and 3) Applicant disclosed he first used marijuana in high school in May 1991, and that he continued to use it casually through about 1995. (Item 4 at 3) In August 1995, he disclosed he was criminally charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. After admitting responsibility and satisfying program requirements, he successfully completed probation before judgment, a pretrial diversion program. He stated the charge was later expunged from his record. (Item 2 at 45, and Item 4 at 3) Applicant\u2019s drug involvement in 1995 is not alleged in the SOR.

He received the FORM on April 12, 2023, and \ndid not respond. The case was assigned to me on July 14, 2023. The Government \nexhibits, including Items 1 through 4, are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, without comment, the single \nallegation of drug involvement (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His admission is incorporated in my findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old systems engineering manager sponsored by a \nsuccessive defense contractor since January 2021. He graduated from high school in \nJune 1992, and subsequently enrolled in a full-time university program of study in August \n1992. He completed the program in May 1996 and was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He \ncontinued his education in August 1998 and was awarded a master\u2019s degree in May 2004. \nApplicant married in November 2003, and divorced in about April 2007. He does not have \nchildren. (Items 2 and 3) \nApplicant disclosed he first used marijuana in high school in May 1991, and that \nhe continued to use it casually through about 1995. (Item 4 at 3) In August 1995, he \ndisclosed he was criminally charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. After \nadmitting responsibility and satisfying program requirements, he successfully completed \nprobation before judgment, a pretrial diversion program. He stated the charge was later \nexpunged from his record. (Item 2 at 45, and Item 4 at 3) Applicant\u2019s drug involvement in \n1995 is not alleged in the SOR. \nIn about April 2011, Applicant completed his first application for a public trust \nposition. He was granted eligibility for access to sensitive information about a month later. \nHe subsequently submitted an SCA in April 2018, seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Applicant stated in his 2021 SCA, that he was granted eligibility for \naccess to top-secret information during the same month. (Item 2 at 50) \nIn his September 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed he purchased and used \nmarijuana from about July 2021 through August 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) He explained that he \nsustained a \u201cdebilitating back injury\u201d and decided to use marijuana to help alleviate his \nsciatic nerve pain. He purchased the marijuana he used in the form of edibles, from a \nlocal dispensary. He stated he ingested it about three to five times during this period. \n(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant stated he also sought medical treatment through a chiropractor, and that \nafter a few weeks of rehabilitation and after purchasing a new mattress, he stopped using \nmarijuana in about August 2021. He has not received drug counseling or treatment, and \nhe stated he does not socialize or associate with any person who uses drugs illegally. \n(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his September 2021 SCA, Applicant responded \u201cyes\u201d to the question of whether \nhe used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. (Item 2 at 48) (SOR \u00b6 1.a, in \npart) Notwithstanding this disclosure, there is no independent evidence in the record to \nestablish he was \u201cgranted access to classified information\u201d when he used marijuana from \nJuly 2021 through August 2021, as alleged. Applicant also acknowledged understating at \nthe time he purchased and used marijuana, that marijuana remains a federally illegal \ncontrolled substance. \nApplicant stated his intention to refrain from using marijuana or any illegal drugs in \nthe future in his September 2021 SCA, and later signed a similar sworn statement in \nFebruary 2023. (Item 2 at 48, and Item 4 at 4) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d EO 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guidelines note several conditional that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \nThe admitted allegations in this case establish the above disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c), and shift the burden to Applicant to provide mitigation of \nthe Government\u2019s security concerns. Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana in July \nand August 2021 is established by his admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a; and by his disclosures in \nhis September 2021 SCA and December 2021 interview with a DOD investigator, \nauthenticated in February 2023.  \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s admission to SOR \u00b6 1.a without comment, it is not \nestablished that his 2021 drug use occurred \u201cwhile [he was] granted access to classified \ninformation\u201d as alleged, and as required by AG \u00b6 25(f). In making this determination, I \nconsidered the Appeal Board guidance provided in ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 10, 2022), recently affirmed in ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, \n2023). The Appeal Board determined that AG \u00b6 25(f) requires proof of a signed \nnondisclosure agreement and evidence of need-to-know access to classified or sensitive \ninformation, neither of which are present in the record. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established. \nGuideline H lists conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate security concerns raised \nby the potentially disqualifying conditions above. The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, starting in high school \nin 1991 and continued through August 1995 after he was criminally charged with a drug \noffense, is not recent. However, his purchase and use of marijuana from July through \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 2021 is recent, having occurred only weeks before his current SCA completed in \nSeptember 2021. Notably, his use also occurred while employed by a federal defense \ncontractor, following applications both a position of public trust in 2011, and a top-secret \nsecurity clearance in 2018. See ISCR Case No. 22-01661 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 21, 2023). \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Though Applicant acknowledged his 2021 drug \ninvolvement and signed a sworn statement to refrain from using marijuana or any illegal \ndrugs in the future, providing some mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(b)(3); he has not mitigated \nconcerns regarding his decision and action to purchase and use marijuana in the first \nplace. Applicant has a prior history of illegal drug involvement starting in 1991. He also \nacknowledged being fully aware that marijuana remains a federally illegal controlled \nsubstance prior to purchasing and using it in 2021. Moreover, though his debilitating back \ninjury was undoubtedly painful, he stated he was able to successfully treat the condition \nafter a few weeks of rehabilitation work with a chiropractor, and purchasing a new \nmattress. Applicant has not established a pattern of abstinence here. He has not provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns regarding his drug involvement. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines H in my whole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nBecause Applicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I \nhad no opportunity to question him about his prior actions or his future intentions of \nmarijuana use, or to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nhis drug involvement.

After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 54 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since March 2021, as a technical specialist. From March 2020 to March 2021, he was unemployed. From 2016 to 2020, he worked in commercial information systems. He holds two master\u2019s degrees. He gave conflicting information regarding his marital status. In his security clearance application (SCA), from April 2021, he stated he first married in 1994 and divorced in 1999. During his hearing testimony, he stated the date of this first marriage were from 2000 to 2014. On his SCA, he stated his second marriage began in June 2016, but he testified that he was married for the second time in May 2022. He has two sons from his first marriage, ages 19 and12.

The DOD \nacted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 21, 2022, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.

After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since March \n2021, as a technical specialist. From March 2020 to March 2021, he was unemployed. \nFrom 2016 to 2020, he worked in commercial information systems. He holds two \nmaster\u2019s degrees. He gave conflicting information regarding his marital status. In his \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), from April 2021, he stated he first married in 1994 \nand divorced in 1999. During his hearing testimony, he stated the date of this first \nmarriage were from 2000 to 2014. On his SCA, he stated his second marriage began in \nJune 2016, but he testified that he was married for the second time in May 2022. He \nhas two sons from his first marriage, ages 19 and12. (Tr. 5, 23-24, 34; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations (Guideline F) \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged Applicant: (1) failed to file his 2014 to 2020 \nfederal and state income tax returns, as required (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b); and (2) owed the \nfederal government approximately $28,733 in delinquent taxes for tax year 2012 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c). \nApplicant\u2019s tax difficulties started in approximately 2012. He was running a family \nbusiness that had about five employees. He attempted to claim a significant amount of \nbusiness deductions on his personal federal tax return for 2012, which the IRS \nultimately disallowed. This resulted in the large tax debt stated in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He also \nclaimed that several personal circumstances contributed to him not being able to file his \nfederal and state tax returns for years 2014 to 2020. Those circumstances included the \nfailure of his business, the death of his father, and his divorce. He admitted that a \ncontributing factor to his non-filing of the returns was his not knowing how to deal with \nthe 2012 tax debt and its implications on the succeeding years\u2019 tax returns. He did not \nthink he could file subsequent federal tax returns if he had not filed an earlier year\u2019s \nreturn. He consulted with a tax professional about this and was told to file all his \ndelinquent returns even if he had not filed an earlier return. Applicant failed to follow this \nadvice because he could not afford a tax professional to prepare and file the unfiled \nreturns.

Federal returns: Applicant testified that he hired a \ntax professional who prepared his 2014-2021 federal tax returns (his delinquent 2021 \nreturn was not alleged and will not be considered for disqualification purposes), which \nwere received by the IRS in September 2022. He supplied the supporting \ndocumentation showing the filed returns. State returns: Applicant testified that he filed \nall his state tax returns for years 2014-2020 in August or September 2022. He did not \nprovide copies of those filed state returns, but he provided a document from his state\u2019s \nDepartment of Revenue, which shows that he filed his 2022 state return and it was \nreceived in April 2023. It also shows an overall zero balance on Applicant\u2019s state tax \naccount. The evidence supports a finding that Applicant filed his 2014-2020 state tax \nreturns in August or September 2022. Federal tax debt of $24,733 for tax year 2012. \nApplicant testified that he was working with the IRS to pay his federal tax debt, which he \nthought now approached $30,000. He provided documentation showing he completed \nan IRS Form 433-F in April 2023, in furtherance of his request for a payment plan. He \nalso provided a document showing the IRS confirmed receiving one payment of $1,366 \non May 16, 2023. He did not provide an overall payment plan. (Tr. 29-30, 32, 42; AE B-\nE)    \nDrug Use (Guideline H) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2010 to 2022 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nApplicant admitted using marijuana at various times from about 2010 to 2022, \nincluding after he completed his security clearance application (SCA) in April 2021. He \nexplained that he used marijuana because of a degenerative back condition that caused \nhim extreme pain. He began experiencing this condition in approximately 1997 or 1998. \nHe has been receiving medical care for the condition since that time. In 2010, he moved \nto a state where use of medical marijuana is legal under state law. He began using \nmarijuana for his back pain and found that it helped. He stopped using it from 2019 to \n2020 because the marijuana caused him to become sleepy frequently and he did not \nlike that effect on him. In October 2021, after he began working for his current employer \nand completed his SCA, his back pain worsened and he began using marijuana again. \nHe continued to use marijuana in February and June 2022 when he experienced back-\npain flareups. Applicant testified he was unaware of his employer\u2019s drug policy which \nprohibited use of marijuana by employees even if such use was authorized under state \nlaw. He admitted that he did not inform his employer about his use of marijuana. He \nprovided a copy of a drug test result from April 2023 showing a negative result for the \npresence of marijuana in his system. He also provided a copy of a prescription he \nreceived in April 2023 for medication to relieve his back pain. (Tr. 25-27, 33; GE 1-2 (pp. \n18-24); AE F) \nApplicant produced a character letter from a work supervisor.

The letter does not state whether the author is aware of the \ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s case. (AE G). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a delinquent federal tax debt that remains unpaid, although he has \nrecently made one payment toward that debt. He also failed to timely file his 2014-2020 \nfederal and state income tax returns. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s federal tax debt is still outstanding. Although he made one payment \ntoward the debt in April 2023, the outstanding balance remains between $25,000 and \n$30,000 on a tax debt incurred in 2012. He has apparently entered a payment plan with \nthe IRS, but he did not document the details of the plan. He gave several reasons for \nhis delayed payment toward his his tax debt and the late filing of his federal and state \ntax returns. While his father\u2019s death, the loss of his business, and his divorce are \ncircumstances beyond his control, the IRS disallowance of deductions on his 2012 \npersonal federal tax return was not such a condition. Regardless, the evidence does not \nsupport that he has taken responsible actions to address his tax debt or timely file his \nfederal tax and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. He receives some credit for \nfinally filing his 2014-2020 federal and state tax returns in 2022, however, that credit is \nminimized by his extended delay in filing those returns. Likewise, he receives some \ncredit for entering into an agreement with the IRS to pay his 2012 tax debt, but his delay \nin doing so minimizes its impact. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not fully apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the Director of National Intelligence \n(DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 memorandum concerning adherence to federal laws \nprohibiting marijuana use. In doing so, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state \ncan authorize violations of federal law, including violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct, which identifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to \nstate law (and the laws of the District of Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not \nalter the national security adjudicative guidelines. And third, a person\u2019s disregard of \nfederal law concerning the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains relevant \nwhen making eligibility decisions for sensitive national security positions.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse. \nFrom about 2010 to June 2022, Applicant used marijuana on numerous \noccasions. I find the above disqualifying condition applies. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two \npotentially apply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana on a regular basis from 2010 to June 2022. Of \nincreased concern, is his admitted multiple uses of marijuana after having completed his \nSCA in April 2021. While he provided a negative drug test result from April 2023 and a \ncopy of his prescription to address his reoccurring back pain, it is too soon to determine \nwhether Applicant will discontinue his use of marijuana to manage his back pain issues. \nHe did not provide a signed statement of intent to abstain from future use. Given his \npattern of use, his abstinence beginning in 2022 is not sufficient to overcome his \nprolonged marijuana use, or to convince me that recurrence is unlikely. The frequency \nand recency of his past use, and his uses after he completed a first SCA in 2021 cast \ndoubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) or 26(b) apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his medical condition, \nhis civilian employment, and his family circumstances, but I also considered his lack of \nprogress in resolving his federal tax debt and timely filing his 2014-2020 federal and \nstate income tax returns. Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. I also considered his recent uses of marijuana. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations and Guideline H, drug involvement and substance abuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1,c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has \na high school diploma, and military training. He holds the position of Aviation Mechanic \nII with a defense contractor. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection \nwith his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to two separate creditors for \ndelinquent accounts totaling approximately $38,000, which were charged off by the \ncreditors. Also, alleged is while in the military, Applicant was investigated for violations \nof the UCMJ Article 21, Larceny: Military Property More Than $500, and Article 132, \nFraud: Making False Claim. In his answer, Applicant admits allegation 1.a., and denies \nallegations 1.b., and 1.c. Credit reports of the Applicant dated October 19, 2021; April \n27, 2022; and September 13, 2022, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 5, \n6 and 7.) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps for nine years from November 2011 to \nNovember 2020. \nDuring his military career, he held a security clearance without \nincident, and was deployed on three separate occasions on overseas tours and multiple \nsmall mission attachments. He received a number of awards and commendations \nincluding Good Conduct Medals, Meritorious Masts Certificates, and several Naval \nAviation Marine Corps Medals. He received an honorable discharge. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits G and H.) \n1.a. \nIn 2013, Applicant was in the military. He married a woman and was receiving \nbasic allowance for housing (BAH), which provides money to cover service members \nhousing and related costs in the civilian market when government quarters are not \navailable. The BAH he received was to support himself and his dependent. In 2015, \nhis wife joined the Air Force and was commissioned as an officer. Applicant continued \nto receive BAH, which he was not entitled to receive. The rule is that a military member \nmarried to another military member who has no dependents other than the spouse is \nentitled to partial BAH, meaning one member receives BAH, not both. Applicant claims \nthat he unknowingly received more BAH than he was entitled to receive. In 2017, \nApplicant and his wife divorced. Applicant stopped the BAH, and Applicant deployed to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nOkinawa. An audit was conducted when Applicant was deployed to Okinawa, IPAC. \nApparently for at least two years, Applicant received BAH which he was not entitled to \namounting to at least $20,000 in extra pay. In November 2017, Applicant was \ninvestigated for violations of UCMJ Article 121-Larceny, Military Property More Than \n$500, and Article 132-Fraud, Make False Claim. Applicant stated that he went before a \nmilitary board, comprised of the Commanding Officer and members from the Squadron. \nHe explained that he unknowingly received more BAH than he was allowed. His \ncommanding officer dismissed the charges against him and nothing more came of the \ninvestigation. Applicant did not receive non-judicial punishment or a court martial. In \n2020, Applicant separated from the military with an honorable discharge. He is entitled \nto re-enlist if he so chooses. For some unknown reason, Applicant was not required to \npay the BAH money back to the military. There was no waiver filed, no garnishment \naction implemented, nor was his salary reduced due to this fraud. \nThe following delinquent debts were of security concern: \n1.b. \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor on an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $32,542. \nHe explained that in 2015/2016, he took out a \npersonal loan that he used on his vehicles, and to loan money to a friend. After a while, \nApplicant was unable to continue to afford to make the monthly payments on the \npersonal loan. He was not contacted by the creditor for payment. When his finances \nimproved, he contacted the creditor and obtained a settlement offer that he agreed to. \nApplicant has now successfully settled the account for less than was owed in the \namount of $16,272. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, E, L, O, and P, and Tr. p. 36.) \n1.c. \nApplicant was indebted to a creditor on an account that was charged off in the \namount of $5,432. This was a credit card that Applicant opened. For a while he was \nusing it and paying it off. He got to a point where he could no longer afford to pay his \nbills and the debt went into collections. He was not contacted by the creditor for \npayment. When his finances improved, Applicant contacted the creditor and resolved \nthe debt in full.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, K, L, and M.) \nApplicant testified that he has also taken a credit counseling class to learn how to \nproperly budget his finances. He states that he is more financially mature and now \nunderstands his mistakes in the past and how to prevent them from happening in the \nfuture. He also knows how to handle his credit and his debts without difficulty. He now \nstrives to follow his monthly budget, and puts money away in savings. (Tr. p. 39.) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent financial statement shows that his current debts are paid off, \nand he is on track and financially sound. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit N.) \nA letter of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s Site Supervisor, who was also in the \nMarine Corps with the Applicant working the same platforms, indicates that Applicant \nhas many favorable characteristics. He has a positive work ethic, attention to detail, \nstrict adherence to rule and regulations, and strives to build a trustworthy relationship \namongst his team and customers. Applicant is described as a great mentor, friend, and \nwork colleague. He is recommended for a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt that he could not afford to pay. He also \nreceived military financial benefits that he was not entitled to receive. His actions or \ninactions both demonstrated a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do \nso. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n  \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has resolved his delinquent debts.  He understands the importance of \nbeing responsible and trustworthy in every aspect of his life, including his finances.  He \nhas paid off his delinquent debts, and is current with all of his regular monthly expenses. \nIn regards to his alleged violations of the UCMJ Article 121-Larceny, and Article 132-\nFraud, he went before a military board for these offenses, he explained that he \nunknowingly received more BAH than was allowed, and the charges against him were \ndismissed.  Furthermore, following this, he received an honorable discharge from the \nmilitary, and the ability to re-enlist if he so chose.   \nApplicant understands the great responsibilities attached with holding a security \nclearance, and the many sacrifices one must make to hold the privilege. He is now \nfollowing a financial budget and has modified his spending habits to be consistently \nfinancially responsible. \nHe also understands that he must follow all rules and \nregulations applicable to him. \nApplicant has demonstrated responsibility and good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

He must continue to be financially responsible going forward. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that the Applicant has carried his \nburden of proof to establish mitigation of the government security concerns under \nGuideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant\u2019s character \nand work ethic are impressive. He must continue to show financial responsibility and \nabide by all rules, regulations, and Federal and state laws in the future, or he will be in \njeopardy of losing his security clearance and access to classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.c  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Except for a period \nfrom May 2015 to August 2017, Applicant has worked for federal contractors since 2008. \nHe was married in 2004 and divorced in 2009. He does not have children. (Item 3) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2021. In it, he \ndisclosed he has held a top secret security clearance since 2008. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that in February 2012, Applicant was charged with operating a \nvehicle while intoxicated and operating a vehicle with .10 blood alcohol content (BAC) in \nState A.

He was arrested and later went to court and pleaded guilty to the \noffense. He said his driver\u2019s license was suspended for some time, but could not recall \nfor how long. He was required to pay a fine and perform community service. (Items 2, 3, \n10) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that in November 2015 he was arrested for driving \nunder the influence (DUI) of alcohol in State B. He was at a bar with friends and consumed \nbetween four to five alcoholic beverages. He felt fine to drive. He was stopped by police \nand failed a breathalyzer test. He pleaded guilty to DUI. He told the government \ninvestigator that he was ordered to pay a fine, complete community service, and his \nlicense was suspended for three months. He admitted SOR \u00b6 1.b that alleged he was \ncharged with DUI in November 2015, found guilty and sentenced to five days in jail and \n36 months probation. (Items 2, 3, 8, 9, 10) \nIn February 2017, Applicant was charged with driving when privilege suspended \nfor prior DUI conviction in State B.

(Items 8, 9) \nIn December 2017, Applicant was charged in State C with leaving the scene of a \ncrash and driving while license revoked due to DUI. It appears he had a plea agreement \nand pleaded guilty or no contest to the revocation offense and received a 30-day jail \nsentence, which was suspended, and a fine. (Item 4) \nApplicant told the government investigator that in April 2019 he was at a friend\u2019s \nhouse and consumed between four and five alcoholic beverages. He was driving home \nwhen he was in a one-car accident. According to the police report, Applicant was trapped \nin the vehicle and the roof had to be cut off by the fire department to extricate him from it. \nHe was observed by the fireman on scene to be highly intoxicated. A check by the police \nrevealed Applicant\u2019s license had been revoked for a previous DUI. The effective dates of \nthe revocation was from July 2016 to July 2019. Applicant refused consent to submit to a \nblood test. The police obtained a search warrant for Applicant\u2019s blood test results. His \nblood alcohol level at the time of the accident was .204%. The court records reflect \nApplicant was charged with DUI in State C, driving while license revoked, and failure to \nhave insurance. He was convicted of the offenses. He received 2 days\u2019 home confinement \nfor the DUI (one day suspended), 30 days\u2019 home confinement for driving with a revoked \nlicense, and fines for all three offenses. (Items 5, 10) \nApplicant told the government investigator that he does not believe he has a \nproblem with alcohol. For his 2015 and 2019 DUI convictions, he was required to attend \ncourt-ordered alcohol awareness classes. He said he no longer drinks and drives. He is \na social drinker and goes out about once a month or two months. He will consume two to \nthree alcoholic beverages and will not drive. He has no intention of drinking and driving \nin the future. He said he will not drive even if he consumes one drink. (Item 10) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that from January 2017 to March 2017 he used \ncocaine three or four times while at parties. He was not working as a government \ncontractor at the time. He told the government investigator that he stopped using it \nbecause he did not like it and he did not intend to use it or any other illegal drug in the \nfuture. (Items 3, 10) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.j alleged delinquent medical accounts, credit cards, \ncommunication services, utilities, and other consumer accounts totaling approximately \n$35,249. Applicant admitted them all in his SOR answer. He told the government \ninvestigator that he had some financial problems during the COVID pandemic when he \ndid not have enough work and fell behind on his bills. When the investigator confronted \nhim with his delinquent accounts he said he was unaware the accounts were delinquent, \nand he would look into them and resolve them. These collection accounts are reported in \nApplicant\u2019s June 2021 and February 2022 credit bureau reports.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nIn 2012, Applicant was charged and convicted of operating a vehicle while \nintoxicated and operating a vehicle with a BAC of .10 % in State A. In 2015, he was \ncharged and convicted of DUI in State B. In 2019, he was charged and convicted of DUI \nwith a BAC more than .15% and driving while license revoked for DUI in State C. His BAC \nat the time was .204%. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating condition under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related incidents beginning in 2012. He does not \nbelieve he has a problem with alcohol, despite three DUI convictions. He was required to \ntake an alcohol education class after two of his convictions. He did not provide any \nevidence that he is participating in alcohol counseling or treatment, evidence of actions \nhe may have taken to overcome his problem or his pattern of maladaptive alcohol use or \nevidence to overcome it. He stated to the government investigator in 2021 that he does \nnot drink and drive anymore. He provided no other evidence that future alcohol-related \nissues are unlikely to recur. None of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following three are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nApplicant has three DUI convictions from 2012-2019. In State B, he was charged \nwith driving when privilege suspended for prior DUI conviction and an active bench \nwarrant remains as of the close of the record. He also has a bench warrant from March \n2017 from State B for failing to comply with probation conditions related to his 2015 DUI. \nIn State C he was charged in December 2017 with leaving the scene of a crash and \ndriving while license revoked for DUI. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has three DUI convictions from 2012 to 2019 and he repeatedly drove \nafter his license was revoked or suspended. He did not establish that the two active bench \nwarrants have been resolved. He did not provide mitigating information about his criminal \nconduct. Based on his past history and pattern of criminal conduct, I cannot find that future \ncriminal behavior is unlikely to recur. Applicant has not provided evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. His past behavior casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used cocaine three to four times in 2017. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant told the government investigator that he used cocaine three to four times \nin 2017 and does not intend to use any illegal drug again in the future. I was unable to \nmake a credibility determination, but note that there are no other indications of illegal drug \nuse in his past and that although he was required to disclose past drug use, it is unlikely \nthat his past use of cocaine would have been discovered had he not disclosed it. It has \nbeen approximately five years since he used cocaine and future use is unlikely to recur. \nI find the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to being underemployed during the \npandemic when he was unable to pay some of his bills. He was unaware of many of his \ndebts, but told the investigator he would look into them and resolve them. He admitted all \nof the debts alleged in the SOR. He did not provide any evidence of actions he has taken \nto pay, resolve, or dispute any of the delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s underemployment may \nhave been beyond his control, but he did not provide evidence of responsible actions to \nresolve the debts.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, \nGuideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline J, criminal conduct. He mitigated the \nGuideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

During this timeframe, he used marijuana socially with friends and to \nhelp him sleep at night. In April 2015, he claimed that he had no intention to use illegal \ndrugs in the future. Notwithstanding this marijuana usage, Applicant was granted a \nsecurity clearance in about June 2015. He did not use illegal drugs between 2014 and \nSeptember 2019. In about September 2019, while he held a security clearance, he used \nthe illegal stimulant \u201cMolly,\u201d or MDMA, on one occasion with friends before attending a \nconcert. He volunteered his illegal drug use in his two Questionnaires for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86), discussed it openly with the investigator during his security \ninterviews in 2015 and 2020, and self-reported the September 2019 illegal drug use to \nhis facility security officer (FSO). He has not used an illegal drug since September 2019. \nHe claimed that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He acknowledged \nthat he has made some poor choices related to illegal drug usage in the past, but that \nhe has learned from his mistakes. He claimed that he understands that illegal drug use \nis not compatible with holding a security clearance. He claimed that he has \u201ccut virtually \nall contact\u201d with the friends with whom he used illegal drugs in the past. His reporting of \nderogatory information regarding his illegal drug use enhances his credibility with \nrespect to these claims. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6, 8; FORM Response) \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns \ndespite being required to do so. His failure to timely file his 2018 federal income tax \nreturn was not alleged in the SOR. He was indebted to the IRS for delinquent federal \ntaxes in the amount of $1,100 for tax year 2017 and $1,900 for tax year 2018. He \nreported this information on his SF 86. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, \nsuch as Applicant\u2019s late filing of income tax returns for the 2018 tax year cannot be used \nfor disqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Items 2-5, 8; FORM Response). \nApplicant filed his late 2017 federal income tax return with the IRS in September \n2020.

He claimed that he timely filed and paid all \nhis federal income tax obligations before and after the 2017 and 2018 tax years. His \nreporting of derogatory information regarding his drug usage and federal tax \ndeficiencies during the clearance process enhances the credibility of his claims. (Items \n2-4, 8; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant illegally used marijuana with varying frequency from 2009 until 2014. \nHe illegally purchased marijuana with varying frequency from 2011 until 2014. He \nillegally used MDMA once in September 2019 while he held a security clearance. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana for five years while he was in college and younger. He \nthen stopped using and purchasing illegal drugs for five years. His abstinence from \nillegal drugs was interrupted by a one-time error in judgment three and one-half years \nago. Acknowledging that this illegal drug use in 2019 was further exacerbated by his \nholding a security clearance, I believe his recent illegal drug use was infrequent enough \nthat it is unlikely to recur. Given the totality of his past drug use, and its infrequency \nsince 2014, I believe that he has established a sufficient period of abstinence from \nillegal drugs. He has also disassociated from drug using associates and contacts. Given \nhis willingness to self-report derogatory information, I find his claims that he will not use \nillegal drugs again to be reliable. Along with his period of abstinence since his last use, I \nconclude his past, illegal drug use does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax return for the 2017 tax year. \nHe owed the IRS delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.   \nApplicant has now filed his late federal tax returns for the 2017 and 2018 tax \nyears. He made a payment arrangement with the IRS and paid his delinquent federal \ntaxes. While I am aware that him \u201cfixing\u201d his federal tax deficiencies does not end the \ninquiry, I note that he remedied these tax deficiencies before the Government issued \nthe SOR, in September 2022. He claimed that he has since timely filed and paid his \nfederal taxes for the 2019, 2020, and 2021 tax years. His actions of staying current with \nhis tax obligations after 2018 show reform and rehabilitation. I believe he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and he made a good-faith effort to resolve his tax \nissues. He made a payment arrangement with the IRS and complied with those \narrangements. He has mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse and financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since 2003. He earned a high school diploma in 2001 and a technical certificate in 2007. He has been married since 2006 and has three children, ages 15, 14, and 3. (Item 3) The SOR alleged two years of unfiled federal tax returns and related past-due tax debt. Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2017 and 2018 tax years, despite being required to do so (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He owed delinquent federal income taxes in the approximate amount of $7,800 for the 2017 tax year (after an offset for a refund from a subsequent tax year) (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Items 1-4) Applicant filed his late income tax return for the 2017 tax year in February 2020. He filed his late federal income tax return for the 2018 tax year in May 2022.

He originally owed about $16,000 in delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 tax year, but he received a credit of about $8,000 in April 2021, because of an offset from his income tax refund for the 2020 tax year. He claimed that he hired a tax professional on an unspecified date to assist him with his taxes and believed that he will not end up owing any delinquent taxes.

He earned a high school diploma in 2001 and a technical certificate \nin 2007. He has been married since 2006 and has three children, ages 15, 14, and 3. \n(Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged two years of unfiled federal tax returns and related past-due tax \ndebt. Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2017 and 2018 \ntax years, despite being required to do so (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He owed delinquent federal \nincome taxes in the approximate amount of $7,800 for the 2017 tax year (after an offset \nfor a refund from a subsequent tax year) (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Items 1-4) \nApplicant filed his late income tax return for the 2017 tax year in February 2020. \nHe filed his late federal income tax return for the 2018 tax year in May 2022. He timely \nfiled his 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns. He originally owed about $16,000 in \ndelinquent federal taxes for the 2017 tax year, but he received a credit of about $8,000 \nin April 2021, because of an offset from his income tax refund for the 2020 tax year. He \nclaimed that he hired a tax professional on an unspecified date to assist him with his \ntaxes and believed that he will not end up owing any delinquent taxes. He provided no \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his belief that he will not owe delinquent federal \ntaxes, or to rebut the information contained in the 2017 IRS tax account transcript. \n(Items 1-4) \nApplicant claimed that he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income \ntax returns because he did not think he would have enough money to pay the taxes he \nwould owe. He also claimed that his purchase of a new house and resultant move \ncontributed to him missing the aforementioned income tax filing deadlines. He claimed \nthat he has been filing his income tax returns for 23 years and has not had any tax \nissues other than for these two years. He does not currently have a payment plan in \nplace with the IRS, but plans to make one in the future if he still owes delinquent taxes. \nIn May 2022, he provided a written budget that reflected a monthly surplus of almost \n$5,000. He also claimed that he sold his house and used a portion of the proceeds to \npay off several of his debts. Applicant did not respond to the FORM, so more recent \ninformation about his finances is not available. (Items 1-4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant did not timely file federal income tax returns for two years despite being \nrequired to do so. He has owed delinquent federal taxes for about five years. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has filed his delinquent federal income tax returns and also timely filed \ntwo additional years of income tax returns. However, he still owes delinquent federal \ntaxes. He does not have a payment arrangement in place with the IRS to address these \ndelinquent taxes. His financial issues are ongoing and I cannot find they are unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 20(a) applies to his delinquent income tax filings, but does not apply to his \ndelinquent taxes, because they are ongoing and not resolved. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns \nbecause he did not believe he could afford to pay his taxes and he sold his home and \nmoved. Neither of these causes were due to circumstances beyond his control. He \ncould have withheld sufficient wages to offset his federal tax obligations, as he claimed \nto have done in the past. Likewise, he was arguably in control of when he moved. \nFurthermore, moving does not reasonably excuse two straight years of not filing income \ntax returns. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant claimed that he sought assistance from a tax professional. However, \nhe still owes delinquent federal taxes with no payment plan in place. Therefore, he has \nnot provided sufficient evidence that his financial issues are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nOther than an offset, Applicant has not made payment on his delinquent federal \ntaxes. He does not have a payment plan in place with the IRS for his outstanding past-\ndue tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant has now filed his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and has \ntimely filed federal income tax returns for two additional years. I find that he has shown \nreform and rehabilitation with respect to filing his federal income tax returns. However, \nhe still owes delinquent federal taxes. He does not have an arrangement in place with \nthe IRS to repay them. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to his failure to timely file his federal income \ntax returns, but does not apply to his delinquent federal taxes. \nWhile two of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file \nincome tax returns, none applies to his delinquent taxes. Application of a particular \nmitigating condition does not necessarily establish overall mitigation. Overall, the \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since December 2018. He has attended several vocational or online colleges but has not earned a degree or certificate. He has been married since 2014, but he has lived separate and apart from his spouse without being legally separated since about 2020. He has three children, ages 11, 9, and 4. He also had a daughter who passed away in a car accident in July 2015. He served with the Virginia National Guard from 2010 until 2017 and has since served with the Maryland National Guard. (Items 1, 7) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 16 delinquent debts totaling approximately $36,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p). These delinquencies consist of the following: car loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); child support (SOR \u00b6 1.c); medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.p); student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.k through 1.m); a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and phone bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.o). He admitted the SOR allegations except for those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p, which he denied. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. All the SOR allegations are established through his admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. Most of the SOR debts became delinquent between November 2017 and June 2020. (Items 2, 4-6) Applicant settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through voluntary payments before the SOR was issued. He provided documentary corroboration to that effect to the DOD investigator",

He has attended several vocational or online colleges \nbut has not earned a degree or certificate. He has been married since 2014, but he has \nlived separate and apart from his spouse without being legally separated since about \n2020. He has three children, ages 11, 9, and 4. He also had a daughter who passed \naway in a car accident in July 2015. He served with the Virginia National Guard from \n2010 until 2017 and has since served with the Maryland National Guard. (Items 1, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s 16 delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $36,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.p). These delinquencies consist of the \nfollowing: car loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b); child support (SOR \u00b6 1.c); medical debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.j, 1.n, and 1.p); student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, and 1.k through \n1.m); a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and phone bills (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.o). He admitted the \nSOR allegations except for those in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p, which he denied. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. All the SOR allegations are established \nthrough his admissions and the Government\u2019s credit reports. Most of the SOR debts \nbecame delinquent between November 2017 and June 2020. (Items 2, 4-6) \nApplicant settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through voluntary payments before the \nSOR was issued. He provided documentary corroboration to that effect to the DOD \ninvestigator during his April 2022 security interview. Prior to the SOR being issued, he \nmade a payment arrangement with the creditor of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b to pay $249 per \nmonth. He provided documentary corroboration of this arrangement to the DOD \ninvestigator, but he has not provided documentary corroboration that he has made \nthese payments. The Government\u2019s March 2022 credit report reflects a balance on this \naccount that is only about $20 less than the balance on the 2020 Government credit \nreport, so he does not appear to be complying with those payment arrangements. \n(Items 3-7) \nApplicant claimed that he settled the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.l before the SOR \nwas issued. However, he has not provided documentary corroboration that he settled \nthese accounts. He claimed that he is paying an additional $50 per month towards his \narrearage on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, but he has not provided documentary corroboration \nof this assertion. For the remainder of the SOR debts he admitted, he claimed that he \nwill either settle or make payment arrangements on those accounts. He provided no \ninformation about the basis for his denial of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p. (Items 2, 7) \nApplicant fell behind on his debts after his daughter passed away in 2015, and \nhis spouse could not work because of her grief. He became the sole earner and could \nnot make ends meet. He was unemployed for about a year from 2013 until 2014. He \nwas also placed on unpaid leave with his current employer from November 2021 until \nJanuary 2022 because his security clearance had \u201cexpired.\u201d According to the \ninformation he provided to the investigator during his April 2022 security interview, he \nspends more money each month than he earns, but stays afloat by borrowing money \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom his parents every month or so.

(Items 3, 7) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a number of delinquent debts, many of which are several years \nold. The above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nExcept for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing \nand therefore recent. He has not provided documentary evidence that he has resolved \nor is resolving the remainder of his SOR debts. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to \npresent documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). The evidence does not show that the debts are \nresolved or are under control. He does not make sufficient money to cover his expenses \neach month, so I cannot find that his financial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by unemployment, a separation, and the \nuntimely death of his daughter in 2015. These causes were beyond his control. \nHowever, he must also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with \nrespect to these debts. He has not. Except for one SOR debt, he has not provided \nsufficient evidence that he has resolved or is resolving the SOR debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) does \nnot fully apply. The lack of resolution of his SOR debts also means that AG \u00b6 20(d) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant arguably disputed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p by denying them in \nhis Answer to the SOR. However, as he provided no basis for his denial, he has not \nshown that the basis for his dispute is reasonable. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nNotwithstanding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, none of the mitigating conditions fully apply. The \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.f has been mitigated pursuant to AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 45, is married with three children, ages 16, 12, and 8. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in May 2000, and a master\u2019s degree in control systems in May 2003. He was initially granted a DOD security clearance in July 2000, in connection his first employer, one of only two employers since he graduated college. He has been employed as an engineer by his sponsor since July 2005. (GE 1; Tr. at 7, 24, 65) Indebtedness History Applicant accrued the SOR debts after discharging previous debts through bankruptcy. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2009, to get a handle on his finances, which had become strained by an interest rate increase on his underwater mortgage. After completing the Chapter 13 repayment plan, his debts were discharged in 2014. The SOR debts arose between about 2015 and 2020, when his finances became overextended again due to changes in his wife\u2019s employment status and income, the birth of his third child, a cross-country move, and the COVID-19 pandemic. (Answer; GE 7 at 2; Tr. at 25-29, 33-34, 46, 70, 73) While Applicant attributed his indebtedness history primarily to circumstances beyond his control, he accepted responsibly for the role that overspending without a savings buffer played. He believes that his financial problems originated with his \u201cna\u00efve\u201d decision to purchase his first home, in an area with a higher cost of living, and a new car, immediately upon becoming married and gainfully empl",

On a date not indicated in the record, \nhe responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. The Government was ready to proceed on October 12, 2022. The case was \nassigned to me on June 1, 2023. On June 12, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that his hearing was scheduled for June 28, 2023. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled via video conference. \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified and I admitted into evidence Applicant Exhibit \n(AE) A and Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, without objection. I appended a \ntransmittal letter to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the \nrecord open until July 26, 2023, to allow him the opportunity to submit additional \ninformation. He timely provided additional documents that I admitted into evidence \ncollectively as AE B, without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 13, \n2023. On November 16, 2023, at Applicant\u2019s request and without objection from the \nGovernment, I reopened the record for good cause to receive additional documents that \nI admitted into evidence collectively as AE C, without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 45, is married with three children, ages 16, 12, and 8. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering in May 2000, and a master\u2019s degree in control \nsystems in May 2003. He was initially granted a DOD security clearance in July 2000, in \nconnection his first employer, one of only two employers since he graduated college. He \nhas been employed as an engineer by his sponsor since July 2005. (GE 1; Tr. at 7, 24, \n65) \nIndebtedness History \nApplicant accrued the SOR debts after discharging previous debts through \nbankruptcy. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2009, to get a handle on his \nfinances, which had become strained by an interest rate increase on his underwater \nmortgage. After completing the Chapter 13 repayment plan, his debts were discharged in \n2014. The SOR debts arose between about 2015 and 2020, when his finances became \noverextended again due to changes in his wife\u2019s employment status and income, the birth \nof his third child, a cross-country move, and the COVID-19 pandemic. (Answer; GE 7 at \n2; Tr. at 25-29, 33-34, 46, 70, 73) \nWhile Applicant attributed his indebtedness history primarily to circumstances \nbeyond his control, he accepted responsibly for the role that overspending without a \nsavings buffer played. He believes that his financial problems originated with his \u201cna\u00efve\u201d \ndecision to purchase his first home, in an area with a higher cost of living, and a new car, \nimmediately upon becoming married and gainfully employed in July 2005. He neither \nunderstood the uncertainties of the housing market nor considered other \u201cwhat-ifs\u201d that \nmight occur. He and his wife were lulled into a false sense of security when they were \nboth gainfully employed, which influenced their debt accumulation and spending habits. \nTheir incomes afforded a certain lifestyle to which they became accustomed.

(Answer; GE 7 at 2; \nTr. at 15, 25-27, 28, 33-34, 38-39, 45, 46, 53, 73, 89) \nApplicant purchased his first home in 2005, during the \u201csub-prime housing boom.\u201d \nHe obtained a mortgage loan with a \u201clow down payment.\u201d When the mortgage\u2019s interest \nrate increased in 2009, the balance on the loan exceeded its fair market value by about \n$80,000, due to the housing market \u201ccrash.\u201d To avoid defaulting on his mortgage loan \nand other debts, he consulted a bankruptcy attorney to explore his options and borrowed \n\u201csome money\u201d from his retirement account. In June 2009, he decided to file a Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy, and not a Chapter 7, because he wanted to honor his debt obligations. His \nChapter 13 repayment plan was confirmed in August 2009. His debts were discharged in \nAugust 2014, after he successfully completed the repayment plan with payments totaling \n$9,000. (GE 1 at 33; GE 6; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4-5; Tr. at 25, 27-29) \nThe bankruptcy allowed Applicant to maintain his mortgage payments until \nNovember 2012, when he relocated from State A to State B. He could not afford to make \nboth the rental payment for his new State B home and the mortgage payment for the \nState A home. Because his mortgage remained underwater by about $75,000, his \nattempts to rent or sell the State A home were unsuccessful. The lender foreclosed on \nhis mortgage loan in about February 2013. The record did not reflect any deficiency \nbalance owed after the lender resold the home. (GE 1 at 33; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4-5; Tr. \nat 25, 27-28) \nDespite the higher cost of living in State B, Applicant and his wife were able to \nmaintain their lifestyle \u201cwithout too much trouble,\u201d since they both had \u201cstable, well-paying \njobs.\u201d However, they began to struggle financially again on a date not specified in the \nrecord, when his wife\u2019s employer underwent new management, who changed the terms \nof her employment. His wife worked in the spa industry. Under her original terms, she \nearned a salary as an independent contractor and paid a rental fee for her workspace. \nUnder her new terms, she earned a commission-based salary, which resulted in a \n\u201csizeable decrease\u201d in her monthly income. After struggling to make ends meet with her \nreduced salary for an unspecified period, he and his wife decided that it was in their \nfamily\u2019s best interest for her to become self-employed. Self-employment allowed her to \nreduce her expenses by not having to pay the rental fee, and to have a flexible schedule \nto care for their children. Although her self-employment income was lower than what she \nearned as an independent contractor, it was higher than her commission-based salary \nand sufficient to meet their needs until October 2015, when complications arose with the \nbirth of their son. (Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s son was born with a medical condition, for which he was hospitalized \nfor \u201cmultiple weeks\u201d following his birth, and again for \u201cmultiple weeks\u201d shortly after his first \nbirthday. Not only did they incur medical expenses that were not fully covered by \ninsurance, but their son\u2019s medical condition precluded him from attending daycare, which \nprecluded his wife from working outside the home. Considering these issues together with \nthe rising cost of living in State B, Applicant and his wife decided to engage the services \nof a debt-relief company (DRC) to consolidate their monthly debt payments before any of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthem became delinquent. At that time, Applicant believed that a \u201cbig company with legal \nbacking\u201d could better represent his interests in negotiating settlements than he could do \non his own. In hindsight, he learned a \u201cvaluable, if not hard lesson\u201d that he may have been \nbetter served by working directly with his creditors. His son\u2019s medical condition eventually \nimproved and he suffered no \u201clong-lasting\u201d health effects. As of the hearing, his son\u2019s \nhealth was \u201cgood.\u201d (Answer; Tr. at 31-32, 37, 70-72) \nDebt Repayment History (through DRC) \nThe DRC required Applicant to stop making all monthly debt payments and allow \nhis debts to fall into delinquent status to facilitate its settlement negotiations with his \ncreditors. He was also required to make bi-weekly payments to the DRC of $657 \nbeginning in June 2018, which increased to $1,314 in September 2018, then $1,382 in \nDecember 2018, and then decreased to $1,089 as of October 2019 (DRC payments). \nThe DRC allocated a portion of the DRC payments to its fees, and then deposited the \nremainder into an account from which it could pay the settlements it negotiated with \nApplicant\u2019s creditors. (Answer; AE B; Tr. at 20, 32-36, 60, 72) \nApplicant struggled to pay the DRC payments at times, particularly after June \n2019, when he relocated from State B back to State A to secure his employment. He and \nhis wife decided that she would not return to the workforce until the fall of 2019, so that \nshe could be home full time with their children over the summer. However, once they \nrealized that her anticipated salary would \u201cjust cover the cost of childcare,\u201d they decided \nthat her return to work \u201cseemed foolish.\u201d His wife\u2019s unemployment during this period \nfurther strained their finances. As a result, in about January 2020, Applicant \u201ccut ties\u201d with \nthe DRC because he could no longer afford to make the DRC payments. (Answer; AE B; \nTr. at 32-36) \nApplicant made 20 DRC payments totaling $17,887 from June 2018 through \nDecember 2019. He recalled that the DRC applied the DRC payments to fully resolve \nthree unalleged debts and make payments toward resolving other debts for which the \nDRC had negotiated settlements. The other debts he managed through the DRC \nincluded: (1) \u201cprobably a handful\u201d of the SOR debts, including SOR \u00b6 1.a; and (2) an \nunalleged $7,304 loan account. As reflected in the table below, Applicant provided \ndocuments showing the amounts paid to the creditors of the three unalleged debts and \nthe associated fees collected by the DRC, which totaled $6,976.

He did not provide a copy of the agreement he signed or any other \ndocuments or information regarding the other debts sufficient to establish the terms of the \nnegotiated settlements, the amounts paid to the creditors pursuant thereto, or the \nassociated fees collected by the DRC. Moreover, he did not otherwise account for how \nthe DRC allocated the remaining $10,911 portion of the DRC payments toward paying \nthe other debts. He only generally referenced the status of the other debts as of the date \nhe terminated the DRC\u2019s services by stating: (1) the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a was \u201cclose\u201d to \nbeing settled in full; (2) the DRC \u201cdidn\u2019t owe\u201d him \u201cany money\u201d because they \u201cwere paying \non my behalf\u201d and \u201cpaid my debt down\u201d a little bit. (Answer; Tr. at 32-36) \nDebt Repayment History (Post-DRC) \nUpon terminating the DRC\u2019s services, Applicant lost all the benefits of the \nsettlements the DRC negotiated for the other debts, including the credits applied for the \npayments made pursuant thereto. Because his creditors revoked the settlements and \nreinstated the original balances owed, he had to restart settlement negotiations on the \nother debts \u201cfrom scratch.\u201d Initially, Applicant found it \u201cdifficult\u201d to negotiate settlements \non his own behalf while he remained the sole income earner for his family. (Answer; AE \nB, C; Tr. at 54, 79) \nThe COVID-19 pandemic further delayed his wife\u2019s return to the workforce not only \nbecause she was solely responsible for homeschooling their children, but also because \nit negatively impacted the spa industry.

However, she did not begin \u201cdrawing some form of income\u201d \nuntil March 2022, when she became self-employed again in a related but different industry \nthan she worked previously.

He attributed those taxes to the extraordinary amounts \nhe owed initially due to changes in his wife\u2019s employment status, and then to his \nincreasing income bracket. Without specifying either the tax years involved or the \namounts owed, he stated that he resolved all but one $4,500 tax bill via payment plans \nhe negotiated with State B. Although he could not recall the specific tax year to which the \n$4,500 tax bill related, he believed it was one of the last tax years (sometime between \n2017 and 2019) before he relocated back to State A. He attributed his delays in paying \nthe State B taxes to \u201csome missteps, and then things outside of our control happened.\u201d \nHe described his tax payment history to State B as \u201canother contributor\u201d to his overall \nindebtedness. He has not had any post-bankruptcy delinquent federal tax debt. He \nreceived a federal tax refund of \u201cabout $1,000\u201d for tax year 2022, because he keeps his \nexemptions from withholdings \u201cpretty low.\u201d (GE 6 at 2; AE B at 2, 13-14; AE C at 2, 11; \nTr. at 30-31, 62-63, 77, 78) \nOn September 23, 2022, State B accepted his request to repay his final $4,500 tax \nbill via 12 monthly payments of $375, beginning in October 2022. He remained current \nwith those payments through October 2023. However, he owed one more payment in \nNovember 2023, because his August 2023 payment was not processed due to an error \nby State B. (AE B at 2, 13-14; AE C at 2, 11; Tr. at 30-31, 62-63) \nAt the hearing, Applicant explained his debt repayment strategy as follows: \nI started from the top and worked my way down. Some of them are more \nwilling to come to agreements that benefit both parties than other ones. And \nthen I also tried to maybe hit on some of the smaller debts first because I \nwanted to get through the progress, take care of those, and then work my \nway up. But there really wasn't any one [sic]-- none of these are priority over \nthe others, because they're all the debt I owe and hey all needed to be \naddressed. It was really just the order -- I started at the top, and whoever \nwas -- whoever was going to work with me. Ones that wanted $500 and \n$600 a month payments, I had to wait until I had settled some of the other \nones financially, just -- $500 payments, it can be a strain.

He anticipated that once he completed repaying his State B taxes and \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.f, he would have the \u201cthe flexibility to be more \naggressive\u201d with his repayment plan payments as well as begin to start repaying the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d. (AE C at 2) \nFinancial Information \nApplicant is the primary wage earner for his family. He attributed the progress he \nhas made in resolving his delinquent debts to his salary increases and the addition of his \nwife\u2019s consistent income since March 2022. He estimated that his gross annual salary \nwas about $80,000, upon his hire in 2005. He had been earning about $60,000 with his \nformer employer, which he considered at the time to be a \u201cbigger\u201d salary increase than it \nwas in hindsight. (Tr. at 65-67). \nIn February 2021, Applicant reported his gross annual salary as $135,000, net \nmonthly salary as $6,500, and net monthly remainder as $400. He also expected to \nreceive a $12,000 bonus at the end of 2021. However, at the hearing, he explained, \n\u201cThat's pre-tax, obviously. It gets thrown into a check, and it looks like you made a million \ndollars a year. That $12,000 goes away real fast.\u201d His \u201cbonuses have actually gone down \nfor three straight years.\u201d He recalled that his 2022 gross bonus was about $8,000. He \nrecollected that he \u201cprobably earmarked\u201d both his 2021 and 2022 bonuses toward \nrepaying debts and increasing his savings. (GE 7 at 4-5; Tr. at 74-75, 76) \n\u201cAbout two months\u201d prior to the hearing, Applicant received an increase in his gross \nannual salary to between approximately $160,000 and $165,000. He also received a \n\u201cbump\u201d in salary of about $400 per paycheck while he worked on a long-term assignment \nfor his employer in State C for about a year between 2022 and 2023. He estimated that \nhis wife has earned a gross annual salary of about $20,000 since about March 2022, \nwhich he calculated based on her receiving \u201cabout $400 a week, roughly.\u201d However, he \nacknowledged that, because she only works \u201cabout 20 hours or so\u201d per week, \u201c$400 might \nbe a bit high.\u201d After the hearing, Applicant reported his and his wife\u2019s monthly net income \nas $7,790 and $1,500, respectively. He also reported a net remainder of $126, after he \nmade reported monthly payments totaling $2,164 toward his delinquent debts. There is \nno information in the record about their prior income history. (Tr. at 5, 54-55, 65, 78-81) \nAt the hearing, Applicant advised that he planned to investigate the status of a new \n$7,304 collection account that caught his attention when he reviewed a June 2023 CBR, \nwhich was provided to him a week before the hearing. He was not able to do so prior to \nthe hearing. After the hearing, he confirmed that the new collection account related to an \nold debt, the unalleged $7,304 loan account he previously managed through the DRC, as \ndiscussed above. After negotiating with the creditor for \u201ca couple of months,\u201d he finalized \na settlement agreement on November 15, 2023, reducing the balance owed to $4,650, to \nbe paid via 31 monthly payments of $150, beginning in December 2023. He learned that \nthe DRC did not provide the creditor with his correct contact information, which is one \nreason why he forgot about the debt. The other reason is that the debt never appeared \non any of the credit reports he reviewed.

He actively uses \nonly two personal credit cards to \u201crebuild credit,\u201d on which he pays the balances in full \neach month. Both cards have credit limits of $300. He opened one in June 2017, and the \nother in April 2023. He carries balances on only two other accounts, on which he timely \nmakes the required monthly payments, including: (1) a personal loan he opened in May \n2023 to pay for hospital fees totaling about $8,500, which were not fully covered by his \ninsurance because he incurred them while he was working in State C; and (2) a vehicle \nloan he refinanced in August 2021 to lower his monthly payment. He chose to use the \nconsumer loan to pay his medical debts because the loan terms \u201cmade sense\u201d to him, \nand to avoid delaying payment to the medical facility. The monthly payments on those \ntwo loans are $298 and $325, respectively. (GE 9; Tr. at 45, 46, 51, 82-86) \nSince the time they began working with the DRC, Applicant and his wife have been \noperating as a primarily \u201ccash family,\u201d with the exceptions noted above. For an \nunspecified period, he has been setting aside funds from his paychecks, in various \namounts, to accumulate savings for \u201csome financial cushion to agree to the settlements \nwith multiple [creditors] concurrently.\u201d As of the hearing, he was allocating $350 per \npaycheck to his savings account. He had a savings account balance of \u201cabout $1,800,\u201d \nand a retirement account balance of \u201cabout $40,000.\u201d He has not been able to save \u201cas \nmuch as [he] should or would like to,\u201d because he has been prioritizing repaying his \ndelinquent debts. He borrowed an unspecified amount from his retirement account to help \nhim refinance his vehicle, as previously discussed, which he is repaying via an automatic \n$175 deduction from each paycheck.

He has never committed a security clearance violation during his 23 years \nas a \u201ccleared employee,\u201d including the years when he worked for his former employer. \nHe understands the importance managing his finances responsibly. He and his wife are \nin a \u201cmuch better head space and financial place now than five years ago.\u201d When they \nengaged the services of the DRC, they began implementing lifestyle changes to avoid \nfuture indebtedness, including substantially reducing their credit-card use, as indicated \nabove. He chose to work in State C, and to live there alone and away from his family for \na year, to avail himself of an opportunity to make extra money to \u201creally attack\u201d his debt \nrepayment efforts.

There were \nsome circumstances out of my control, but again, my responsibility to \nprobably keep things managed so if things out of my control do happen, I \ndon't succumb to them.

COVID did happen. Nothing I \ncould change about that. So I can't really change the history. I can just show \nthe efforts I've made over the last year that kind of aligned with [my wife] \ngoing back to work, which is sort of, we're thinking, for the family. A single-\nincome family is tricky to support a family of five. (Tr. at 53) \nIt's rather embarrassing, quite frankly, to have the education I do and be \nable to some of the technical work but then . . . having issues with my own \npersonal finances. I'd hope that I'd shown that with the wherewithal \nfinancially in my household to address these debts in an expedient manner \nI've done so. I understand that there's still some left, and there's still some \nconcerns we're trying to address. . . And this was a lapse in judgment for a \nprotracted period of time or prolonged.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 19 under this guideline: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the alleged \nconcerns under this guideline and find the following warrant discussion: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAdjudication of security clearance eligibility involves evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and is not a debt-collection proceeding. The \nAGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each debt alleged in the \nSOR, or to be debt free; nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be \nresolved first. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the indebtedness and \nthen take significant actions to implement the plan. \nApplicant began actively working to address his post-bankruptcy indebtedness \nmore than four years before the SOR was issued. He proactively sought professional \nassistance at the first sign of his financial distress in 2018, before his debts became \ndelinquent. Despite not receiving the full benefit from his creditors, he is credited with \nmaking payments totaling $17,887 between June 2018 and December 2019, to address \nhis debts. During that period, he was able to resolve three unalleged debts, which initially \ntotaled $10,997. \nSince terminating the DRC\u2019s services for good cause, Applicant has worked \ndiligently with his creditors to repay his remaining debts within his available means. \nBetween April 2019 and January 2020, before the SOR was issued and despite the \nchallenges of his single-income family, he made consistent monthly payments of \nunknown amounts to resolve three additional unalleged debts, which initially totaled \n$5,745. In May 2022, after his wife became gainfully employed, he paid unknown \namounts to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n, which initially totaled $3,215. \nBetween October 2022 and October 2023, he paid $4,125 toward resolving his remaining \nState B tax debt, and at least $9,919 toward resolving the remaining SOR debts. The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, and 1.l through 1.o. have been resolved. \nAlthough not yet resolved, Appellant initiated and is adhering to good-faith efforts to \naddress the debts SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, 1.h through 1.i, and 1.k; his State B tax debt; \nand the unalleged $7,304 loan account. \nIn total, Applicant has paid at least $31,931 toward resolving his indebtedness \nsince 2018, not including the unknown amounts that he also paid. His testimony was \nsincere and credible. He demonstrated responsible actions to address his indebtedness, \nboth before and since it became a security concern. His understanding about finances \nhas evolved. He demonstrated a reformed approach to using credit cards. His decision \nto incur new debt to repay a large medical bill was reasonable under the circumstances. \nHis recent credit report demonstrates that he lives within his means and manages his \nfinances responsibly. The poor judgment and overspending that contributed to his \nindebtedness was not motivated by a willful violation of his financial obligations. His \nprolonged track record of payments and responsible actions lead me to conclude that he \nwill follow through with his plan to fully resolve his remaining delinquent debts and to avoid \nany future indebtedness. \nApplicants\u2019 finances became overextended due to circumstances that were both \nwithin and beyond his control. Since then, he has implemented a reasonable repayment \nplan and has made meaningful progress in implementing that plan over an extended \nperiod. Because the record lacked information sufficient for me to determine how much \nof the resulting indebtedness should be allocated to his poor judgment and overspending, \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \nI am unable to conclude that his indebtedness largely resulted from circumstances \nbeyond his control. For that reason, I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Conversely, \nconsidering the responsible way Applicant has addressed his delinquent debts, I am able \nto conclude that his finances are under control, unlikely to recur, and no longer cast doubt \nabout his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Accordingly, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(c), and 20(d) apply to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o: \nFor Applicant \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

She admitted all four of the allegations. (SOR Answer) \nIn her SCA, SOR response, subject interview, and her testimony, Applicant \nadmitted using marijuana since about October 2007. She began using it as a teenager \nand has found it improves her mood. She experienced depression in high school and \nturned to marijuana and alcohol to self-medicate. A mental health professional eventually \nproscribed anti-depressants which she found to be effective. She has been open with her \ntherapist and primary care physician regarding her marijuana use and neither expressed \nconcern. Upon legalization in her state, she obtained a medical prescription for marijuana \nand vapes it. She stated her prescription marijuana helps her to feel relaxed, optimistic, \nand peaceful. She last used marijuana the morning of the hearing.

(SOR Answer, GE 1 at 41-44, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 14, 47) \nApplicant stated prior to her state legalizing marijuana for medical purposes, she \nwould purchase it on various occasions for personal use from friends or friends of friends. \nShe would occasionally sell small amounts to friends. On average, she purchased a few \ngrams every few months. (GE 1 at 41-43, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 44-46) \nIn about February of 2012, while studying overseas as part of a semester abroad, \nApplicant used cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms. She was offered the mushrooms \nby a friend she was studying with while on a sight-seeing trip and was offered the cocaine \nat a night club. She did not purchase either of them. She tried both. She has not used \nthem since and has no intention of using them again. She is no longer close to the friend \nwho was with her at the time. (SOR Answer, GE 1 at 42-43, GE 2 at 3-4, Tr. 49-54) \nApplicant tore her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in late 2012 or early 2013. She \nwas prescribed codeine for pain management. During the treatment period, she did not \nuse all of the codeine. She had four to five pills left after the prescription period ended. \nFrom March through December 2013 Applicant used the remaining four to five codeine \npills for additional pain management. After they were gone, she used Tylenol or ibuprofen. \n(SOR Answer, GE 1 at 44-45, GE 2 at 4, Tr. 54-55) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause physical \nor mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant has used marijuana with varying frequency, from about October 2006 to \nat least January 2022. She intends to continue to use her medically prescribed marijuana \neven though she acknowledges its use violates federal law. She illegally purchased \nmarijuana with varying frequency from about October 2007 to at least October 2019. She \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nused cocaine and hallucinogenic mushrooms in about February 2012. She used four to \nfive prescription codeine pills after her prescription for them had expired. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s long-term use of marijuana, use of cocaine and hallucinogenic \nmushrooms, and expired codeine satisfy AG \u00b6 25(a). The illegal use of marijuana, a \nSchedule I controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), alone constitutes substance \nmisuse. Her illegal purchase of marijuana satisfies AG \u00b6 25(c). Finally, her expressed \nintent to continue marijuana use satisfies AG \u00b6 25(g). \nNext, I considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is grounds \nfor revocation of national security eligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nConsidering the evidence, none of the mitigating conditions apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a -\nb. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use is frequent, ongoing, and she intends to continue her use. \nShe admitted she had last used marijuana the before the hearing. I did not consider this \nas disqualifying as it was not alleged, however, I did weigh it in considering mitigation. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a closer call as Applicant\u2019s purchases of marijuana since legalization in her \nstate in 2019 are legal under state law, however, they remain illegal under federal law. \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhallucinogenic mushrooms in February 2012 occurred over 11 years ago, when she was \nin college studying overseas, she did not purchase them, and has no desire to use them \nagain. I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c is mitigated. Applicant\u2019s use of four to five codeine pills prescribed \nto her outside of the prescription period to relieve pain was ten years ago. I find SOR \u00b6 \n1.d is also mitigated. \nMarijuana use and possession remains prohibited under federal law. \u201cMedical \nmarijuana has no special or preferred status under either the adjudicative guidelines or \nthe new clarifying guidance. \u201c[D]isregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains \nrelevant, but not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified \ninformation . . . .\u201d SecEA Clarifying Guidance at 2.\u201d ISCR Case No. 20-02974 at 5 (App. \nBd. Feb 1, 2022). \nApplicant\u2019s candor is commendable and I weighed that in her favor. All of the \nallegations in the SOR were known only because she disclosed them on her SCA. \nNonetheless, Applicant admits she knows marijuana use is prohibited under federal law. \nShe has used marijuana consistently for nearly 17 years. This behavior raises substantial \nquestions about her judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Viewed as a whole, her conduct raises eligibility concerns, such as poor \njudgment, that are broader than her marijuana use. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns about her drug involvement and substance \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nmisuse, which includes an expressed intent to continue use. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant a security clearance.

(TR at \npage 21 line 11 to page 23 line 25, at page 54 line 16 to page 55 line 11, at page 56 line \n15 to page 57 line 18, and GX 1 at pages 15~16.) I find this to be a willful falsification. \n1.c. and 1.d. These allegations relate to the same incident. Applicant admits that \nin about February of 1981 he was charged with Suspicion of Burglary. (TR at page 24 \nline 1 to page 25 line 15.) I find that this event that occurred more than 40 years ago \ndoes not have present security significance under Personal Conduct. \n1.e. Applicant admits that in about February of 1995 he was charged with illegal \nPossession of a Firearm. (TR at page 25 line 16 to page 26 line 17.)

Applicant admits that he used marijuana, sometimes on a daily \nbasis, from about 1978 until about June of 2019, a period of more than 40 years. He \nestimates his usage to be between 1,000~10,000 times. Applicant also purchased the \nmarijuana he used, knowing that for the vast majority of the 40 years his use and \npurchases were illegal. (TR at page 20 lines 10~22, at page 47 line 25 to page 49 line \n15, and at page 53 lines 16~19.) \n2.c.

(TR at page 49 line 16 to page 50 \nline 3, and at page 66 lines 18~24.) \n2.d. Applicant admits that in about November of 1980, in California, he was \ncharged with Possession of Concentrated Cannabis. (TR at page 50 lines 4~6.) \n2.e Applicant admits that in about January of 1987, in California, he was charged \nwith Plant Marijuana. (TR at page 50 lines 10~13.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nApplicant falsified his February 2020 SCA in his answers to two posited \nquestions. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply. It is not reasonable to believe that \nApplicant forgot that he used marijuana, perhaps thousands of times, during the time \nperiod in question. It is also incredible that he did not remember that he received a \nwritten warning from his employer, for misuse of his company credit card, in an amount \nin excess of $4,000. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant smoked and purchased marijuana over a period of more than 40 years. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. It is too soon to find that Applicant\u2019s extensive use of \nmarijuana is not of present security significance. Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is found against Applicant \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace and in his community. (AppXs A~II.) However, overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the Personal Conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.~1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.~ 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse The Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in the use of controlled substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose; and can raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The SOR alleges that from May 2019 to January 2022, Applicant has used marijuana with varying frequency. Applicant stated that he would use marijuana about eight to nine times a month. He would use it with his brother and their friends. Marijuana would make him feel calm and less irritated. From about November 2021 to about January 2022, Applicant has used marijuana about seven times after completing his security clearance application dated November 16, 2021. Applicant usually obtained marijuana from co-workers, or at school, and when it became legal in his state, he purchased it at a dispensary. Applicant has never received any treatment for drug abuse. People who know about his marijuana use are the people he smokes with. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. (Government Exhibit 2.)

He is seeking to obtain \na security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in the use of controlled \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose; and can raise questions about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe SOR alleges that from May 2019 to January 2022, Applicant has used \nmarijuana with varying frequency. Applicant stated that he would use marijuana about \neight to nine times a month. \nHe would use it with his brother and their friends. \nMarijuana would make him feel calm and less irritated. From about November 2021 to \nabout January 2022, Applicant has used marijuana about seven times after completing \nhis security clearance application dated November 16, 2021. Applicant usually obtained \nmarijuana from co-workers, or at school, and when it became legal in his state, he \npurchased it at a dispensary. Applicant has never received any treatment for drug \nabuse. People who know about his marijuana use are the people he smokes with. \nApplicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. (Government Exhibit 2.) \nIn his security clearance application dated November 16, 2021, Applicant \nexplained that he uses marijuana for anxiety purposes induced by stress. He normally \nuses it on weekends about twice a day. Sometimes he over thinks situations and \nmarijuana helps to prevent this. He stated that he has no intent to use marijuana in the \nfuture. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nDuring an interview with a Federal investigator on January 27, 2022, Applicant \nconfirmed his use of marijuana between May 2019 and January 22, 2022. He stated \nthat he last used it at a techno concert. He also disclosed that since completing his \nsecurity clearance application on November 16, 2021, he has continued to use \nmarijuana, at least seven times total. (Government Exhibit 4.) \nIn response to the Government\u2019s interrogatories dated July 21, 2022, Applicant \nstated that he had no intent for future use of marijuana due to the nature of the job he \nenjoys. His job brings less stress to his life. He is also motivated to live a healthier life. \n(Government Exhibit 4.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains three conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and   \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of the mitigating factors are applicable. \nApplicant has a history of \nmarijuana use from May 2019 to at least January 2022. In his security clearance \napplication dated November 16, 2021, Applicant stated that he has no intent to continue \nusing marijuana in the future. Despite being on noticed that use of illegal drugs is a \nsecurity concern, Applicant continued to use marijuana. \nHe used it approximately \nseven times per month after completing his security clearance application at least up \nuntil January 2022. While talking with the Federal investigator, Applicant was asked \nwhy he wrote in the security clearance application that he intends to stop using \nmarijuana, and he responded, \u201cthat was the plan and he did not follow through with it.\u201d \nApplicant continues to socialize with people who use marijuana. \nAlthough he has \nindicated a desire to stop using marijuana, he has not demonstrated that he can stop \nusing it. He understands that it is illegal and prohibited by the Department of Defense, \nbut has disregarded Federal law for his convenience. Applicant\u2019s recent actions cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nConsidered in totality, Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and/or the ability to abide by rules and regulations. To be entrusted with the \nprivilege of holding a security clearance, applicants are expected to abide by all laws, \nregulations and policies that apply to them. Under the particular facts of this case, \nApplicant does not show the maturity level, integrity, and reliability necessary to access \nclassified information. Applicant does not meet the eligibility qualifications for a security \nclearance. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. Applicant understands the requirements \nassociated with holding a security clearance and knowns that marijuana use is not \ntolerated. Applicant is not an individual in whom the Government can be confident to \nknow that he will always follow rules and regulations and do the right thing, even when \nno one is looking. Applicant does not meet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In other words, he did not intentionally withhold any \ninformation on his security clearance application. On April 30, 2020, he was interviewed \nby an investigator in conjunction with his security clearance background investigation. \nThe investigator questioned him about his employment with Employer A, specifically \nwhether he ever received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace, or terminated. Applicant replied, \u201cNo.\u201d The \ninvestigator confronted him with information that Employer A fired him because he failed \na post-accident drug screen. Once confronted, Applicant admitted to having a positive \ndrug test for marijuana in November or December 2019. He said Employer A allowed him \nto resign in lieu of being terminated. He admitted to using marijuana on one occasion to \ntreat back pain after he hurt his back at work. Employer A later sent him to an urgent care \nclinic to have his back checked because it was a work-related injury. Applicant was \nrequired to provide a urine sample as part of the treatment. The sample tested positive \nfor marijuana. (Item 6 at 7-8) \nA few days later, Applicant\u2019s supervisor informed him that he violated the drug \npolicy and would be terminated. He told his supervisor that he would resign because he \nneeded a better paying job. He believed his employment record with Company A would \nindicate he resigned. He did not list his termination on the January 2020 SCA because \nhe did not believe he was terminated. He claims he only used marijuana on one occasion. \nHe has not used marijuana since. He is aware that he is not allowed to use marijuana or \nother drugs while holding a security clearance.

While Applicant denied failing \u201ca \nscheduled or random drug test\u201d in response question 8 on interrogatories sent to him by \nthe Department of Defense on November 9, 2021, he previously admitted to testing \npositive for marijuana during a work-related urinalysis during his personal subject \ninterview on April 30, 2020. The Government was on notice that Applicant failed a \nurinalysis test. His incorrect answer to question 8 on the November 2021 Interrogatory \nwas not material because he admitted his failed urinalysis during his personal subject \ninterview after being confronted by the background investigator. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse under AG \u00b6 25 and the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe record evidence shows that Applicant possessed and used marijuana on one \noccasion to treat his back pain after a work-related injury. His illegal use of marijuana \nresulted in a positive urinalysis test during his employment with Employer A. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \n25(b), and 25(c) apply. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions raise security \nconcerns under Guideline H. The burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6E3.1.15) An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, \n2005)) \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \ncondition under AG \u00b6 26 potentially applies: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. \nApplicant used marijuana on one occasion after suffering a back injury at work. \nThis incident occurred four years ago.

AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. The concern under Guideline \nH is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. The following will normally result in an \nunfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating the individual may \nnot properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but \nis not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana \nuse, positive urinalysis, and resignation in lieu of being terminated occurred a few months  \nbefore he completed his January 2020 security clearance application.

The questions in Section 13A \u2013 \nEmployment Activities, and Section 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity were clear.  \nI cannot conclude Applicant misunderstood these questions. I also note that Applicant did \nnot disclose his illegal marijuana use, positive urinalysis and termination from Employer \nA, until he was confronted by the investigator with the facts during his April 2020 \nbackground investigation interview. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies with respect to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.e. Applicant\u2019s past \nconduct has shown a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. He failed to follow his \nworkplace drug testing policy, which resulted in his termination in 2019. He also failed to \nfollow his state traffic laws, specifically, he failed to renew his automobile registration and \ncontinued to drive his unregistered automobile. He initially received a citation for this \noffense in March 2019. He continued to drive his unregistered car and received another \ncitation in November 2019. He was found guilty and was fined and received a civil \nassessment. He did not prove he paid the fines and civil assessments. His failure to follow \nrules raises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17 potentially apply \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply with respect to Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications \nregarding his illegal marijuana use and subsequent termination by Employer A on his \nJanuary 2020 SCA, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. During his personal subject \ninterview, he did not admit that he used marijuana and later tested positive for marijuana \nin a subsequent urinalysis until he was confronted about it. While he believed he was \nallowed to resign rather than be fired from Employer A, he should have answered \naffirmatively in response to Section 13A - Employment Activities, with regard to whether \nin the last 7 years had he ever been fired, or quit after being told you would be fired? He \ndid not volunteer this information until he was confronted by the investigator conducting \nhis background investigation interview. He did not make a prompt good-faith effort to \ncorrect his falsehoods before being confronted with the facts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s falsifications on his SCA are not \nconsidered minor. A person applying for a security clearance is expected to be truthful \nwith the Government at all times. Applicant\u2019s deliberate falsifications on his SCA \nregarding his illegal marijuana use and his subsequent termination from Employer A \nraises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply because Applicant has a history of rule violations that \nraise questions about his reliability and judgment. He has not demonstrated any steps \ntaken to prevent future rule violations. In fact, the fines for the traffic citation alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e remain outstanding. \nApplicant did not mitigate the concerns raised under Personal Conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in \nthis whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s honorable service with the United States Army. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use occurred more than four years ago. There is no evidence \nin the record indicating that Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana occurred more than one \ntime. I find for Applicant related to the concerns raised under Guideline H. \nMore concerning is Applicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose his illegal drug use \nand subsequent termination from Employer A on his January 2020 SCA. This occurred \njust two months after he was terminated by Employer A for testing positive for marijuana \nduring a urinalysis test. He did not admit to these issues until he was confronted by the \ninvestigator conducting his background investigation.

They call them all the time for nothing.\u201d (Tr. 85) \n \nApplicant had difficulty remembering dates of events and periods of sobriety. He \nsaid, \u201cI have no recollection of what year was what. The years, they\u2019re written down. I \ncould look at it and read them and know them. But that\u2019s how I\u2019d have to do it.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of substance use disorder; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \nThe record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and 25(d). AG \u00b6 25(b) is not established \nbecause Department Counsel withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.e. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not established because \nthere is no evidence that Applicant holds a sensitive position or had access to classified \ninformation. Additional discussion of the disqualifying conditions is in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant admitted that he possessed and used marijuana, methamphetamine, and \ncocaine. He was diagnosed in 2020 with Cannabis Use Disorder in Early Remission. \nPossession of Schedule I and II controlled substances are federal criminal offenses. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. See Drug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nlisting \nat \nhttps://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-\nscheduling. See also Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of \nmarijuana on Schedule I). (HE 5) Methamphetamine and cocaine are Schedule II \ncontrolled substances. Information not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualification purposes. \nThe Security Executive Agent (SecEA) promulgated clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications as follows: \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

The \npolice report for his May 20, 2019 arrest states that the police officer noticed the smell of \nmarijuana emanating from Applicant\u2019s vehicle, and he asked Applicant when he last \nsmoked marijuana, and Applicant told the police officer that he had \u201ca few hits from a \njoint\u201d about five hours earlier. (GE 8 at 2) The police officer asked Applicant how often he \nsmoked marijuana, and Applicant initially said he smoked weekly, and then he clarified, \n\u201che smoked nightly before bed.\u201d (Id.) A September 2, 2020 progress note for his drug and \nalcohol treatment, said Applicant \u201csmokes nightly\u201d and \u201cstarted out smoking on weekends \nthen smoke before bedtime.\u201d (GE 11 at 2, 4) He also indicated he stopped using \nmarijuana.

He reports his cannabis use to have decreased in the past 10 \nyears. His last reported use was in May 2019 when he would occasionally \nuse cannabis at nighttime for relaxing. (GE 11 at 6)   \nI find that the most accurate and truthful description of Applicant\u2019s history of abuse \nof illegal drugs occurred when he was seeking treatment for his drug abuse.

He used marijuana and methamphetamine after he completed his \n2018 SCA and while holding a security clearance. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. His cocaine use in the \n1990s is not recent, and there is no evidence of subsequent cocaine use. He used \nmethamphetamine two or three times with the most recent use possession and use \noccurring on May 20, 2019. His methamphetamine possession and use are not recent. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are mitigated. He provided evidence of actions taken to overcome his \ninvolvement. He attended and successfully completed substance abuse counseling. He \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s statement of intent to refrain from future marijuana use is not \nreliable because of his falsifications of security documents, discussed infra. His credibility \nwas damaged when he falsified his SCAs in 2018 and 2020 and his 2022 DOHA \ninterrogatories. Applicant wrote in his response to the DOHA interrogatory about his \nhistory of drug involvement that he used methamphetamine twice in October 2017, and \nmarijuana four times in May 2019. Because of these intentional false statements, I do not \nbelieve his statements about refraining from marijuana possession and use since 2019 or \n2020. See ISCR Case No. 22-00657 4-5 (App. Bd.

Guideline H security concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 describes the security concern about criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.

Discussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges Applicant\u2019s possessions of marijuana, cocaine, and \nmethamphetamine are criminal offenses. His multiple marijuana possessions are not \nmitigated; however, his multiple cocaine and methamphetamine possessions are \nmitigated because they are not recent. \nAmended SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that on or about May 20, 2019, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with DUI; however, he was convicted of a lesser offense. His blood test \nshowed THC use, and marijuana possession is a criminal offense. \nAmended SOR \u00b6 2.c alleges on about March 23, 2017, Applicant was \u201carrested for \nand charged with two counts of Domestic Violence Assault, 4th degree. He pleaded guilty \nto the two assaults. These two crimes are substantiated; however, they are not recent, \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand there is no proof similar offenses have recurred.

This offense is not substantiated. \nApplicant\u2019s falsifications of security documents, discussed infra, are not used for \ndisqualification; however, they show lack of credibility and rehabilitation. None of the \nmitigating offenses apply to all SOR allegations. In sum, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are not \nmitigated, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d are mitigated. Criminal conduct concerns are not \nmitigated. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides one personal conduct condition that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in relation to his provision of inaccurate information on \nhis SCA: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant falsely denied that he had ever used marijuana on his April 19, 2018, \nand September 30, 2020 SCAs. He said he only used marijuana four times on his August \n9, 2022 response to Interrogatories. Applicant said he did not deliberately and \nintentionally provide false information in his SCAs and in his DOHA interrogatories. He \nhurried through the SCAs without carefully reviewing his responses to the questions. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they [are] not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019), the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nI conclude that Applicant knowingly and intentionally provided false information \nabout his history of marijuana use. In his two SCAs, he denied any marijuana use. He \ninformed medical personnel that he frequently used marijuana, and he was diagnosed \nwith Substance Use Disorder. In his April 19, 2018 SCA, he disclosed treatment for \u201cTHC \n(Such as marijuana, weed, pot, hashish, etc.)\u201d in January 2005; however, this disclosure \nis insufficient to show he acted in good faith when he denied that he ever used marijuana. \nThe April 19, 2018 SCA does not include any information about his marijuana use while \nholding a security clearance. \nAG \u00b6 17 includes five conditions which could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. His falsifications of security documents \nare recent, repeated, serious, and intentional. Personal conduct security concerns are not \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H, J, \nand E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old maintenance technician who has worked for federal \ncontractors since 2009. In 2005, he completed an apprenticeship. His resume and \nbiography provide additional details about his background and professional experience. \nFor many years, Applicant was an elite athlete who competed in international \ncompetitions on behalf of the United States. As part of his sports career, he met the \nPresident and First Lady at the White House. He has held a security clearance since \n2009. \nApplicant loves his job, and he would like to continue in his current employment. \nHe received a coin and a letter of appreciation from his employer for voluntarily working \novertime, showing initiative. and resolving problems. He provided 12 character \nstatements from friends, family, and coworkers. The general sense of their statements is \nthat he is friendly, hardworking, honest, and family oriented. The character evidence \nsupports reinstatement of his security clearance. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive. Applicant \npossessed and used marijuana on many occasions, including while holding a security \nclearance. His decisions to repeatedly possess and use marijuana is an indication he \nlacks the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets. He falsely denied \nthat he had ever used marijuana on his April 19, 2018 and September 30, 2020 SCAs. \nHe said he only used marijuana four times on his August 9, 2022 response to \nInterrogatories. These statements are not true, and Applicant knew they were not true \nwhen he made them. \nA failure of an applicant to provide honest and candid self-reports of derogatory \ninformation on security documents is an important indication that, if granted security \nclearance eligibility, that applicant would likely not disclose any threats to national \nsecurity, if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or \npersonal reputation. \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to fully mitigate drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, criminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c and 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the four SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d) but asserted that \u00b6 1.c was a duplicate of \u00b6 1.b. Her admissions are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 58 years old. She was married from 1984 through 1994, when she and her husband divorced. She has a son and a daughter. She has been employed as a financial analyst for a consulting company since 2020. She has held similar jobs in that field, as a federal contractor from 2007 through 2014 and 2014 through 2020. She has held a clearance since September 2018. (Item 2) 2 Applicant reported on her SCA that she had some delinquent debts, stating \u201cI got behind on some of my bills and I am working on catching up.\u201d She disclosed several debts, including a $22,000 voluntary repossession of a vehicle in about December 2014.

(Items 4, 5) As alleged, the SOR debts total $28,895, though Applicant asserts that one debt, for $2,662, is a duplicate. SOR \u00b6 1.a ($22,271) is a charged-off debt relating to an auto repossession.

(Item 1) \nThe CAS issued the SOR under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 24, 2022, and elected to have her case \ndecided by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on the administrative (written) record, instead of a hearing. (Item 1) With her SOR \nresponse, she also provided seven pages of documents, including excerpts from a credit \nreport (Applicant Exhibit (AE) A) and two emails regarding debt payments (AE B). \nOn September 22, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 5. \nDOHA mailed the FORM to Applicant the next day, and she received it on October 28, \n2022. She was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit materials in response, \nand to object to the Government\u2019s evidence. \nOn or about December 16, 2022, having received no response from Applicant, the \ncase was forwarded to the DOHA hearing office. The case was assigned to me on or \nabout January 26, 2023. A day later, a member of DOHA\u2019s administrative staff forwarded \na request from Applicant, through her employer, for additional time to submit documents \nin response to the FORM. I granted the request and reopened the record. (Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I) \nOn or about February 14, 2023, Applicant submitted documents in response to the \nGovernment\u2019s FORM, including a November 21, 2022 update to her answer to the SOR \n(\u201cSOR Reply\u201d), seven documents regarding debt payments, dated between August 2022 \nand January 2023 (AE C - I) and November 2022 credit reports from Experian, Equifax, \nand TransUnion (AE J, K, and L, respectively). The record closed upon receipt of these \ndocuments. \nGovernment Item 1, the SOR and the Answer, are the pleadings in the case. \nGovernment Items 2 through 5 are admitted without objection. The SOR Reply and \nApplicant Exhibits A through L are also admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the four SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.d) but asserted that \u00b6 1.c was a duplicate of \u00b6 1.b. Her admissions are included \nin the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 58 years old. She was married from 1984 through 1994, when she and \nher husband divorced. She has a son and a daughter. She has been employed as a \nfinancial analyst for a consulting company since 2020. She has held similar jobs in that \nfield, as a federal contractor from 2007 through 2014 and 2014 through 2020. She has \nheld a clearance since September 2018.

(Item 3) \nThe SOR debts are detailed in credit reports from November 2021 and June 2022. \n(Items 4, 5) As alleged, the SOR debts total $28,895, though Applicant asserts that one \ndebt, for $2,662, is a duplicate. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($22,271) is a charged-off debt relating to an auto repossession. (Item \n4 at 3, Item 5 at 2) During her first background interview, she indicated that she had taken \nno action to address the debt with the creditor since the repossession and was not willing \nto do so. She said she hoped the debt would fall from her credit report. In her Answer to \nthe SOR, she admitted the debt, and noted that it should \u201cfall off my credit report by March \n2023,\u201d seven years after it appeared. (Item 1) She also provided a credit report excerpt \nnoting the debt. (AE A) (Item 3 at 2) \nIn her SOR Reply, Applicant said the debt had fallen off of her credit report and \nprovided recent credit reports as proof. (AE J, AE K, AE L) She explained that her \ndaughter became pregnant in 2015 and Applicant moved into a larger house with her \ndaughter and the daughter\u2019s then-boyfriend with an agreement that they would share \ncosts. They failed to do so. Applicant had to absorb all the costs herself, leading her to \nfall behind on this debt and others. (SOR Reply; Item 3 at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($3,786) is an account placed for collection by a credit union. As of \nNovember 2021, this account, # 512362, had a balance of $4,114. (Item 3 at 4); as of \nJune 2022, this account had a balance of $3,786, as alleged. (Item 5 at 2) Applicant \nprovided documents with her Answer and SOR Reply showing that she made payments \nof $100, $150, $100, $150, and $150 between January and October 2022. (AE B \u2013 AE \nH) This account is being paid.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,662) is an account charged off by the same credit union as the \ncreditor for SOR \u00b6 1.b. This account, # 5570XXXXXXXX4535, is listed on both credit \nreports (Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 2) Applicant asserted that she has had only one account \nwith this credit union and said she had disputed the account. (AE A; SOR Reply) She \ncited the Equifax credit report, noting account number 4535. This account is listed on that \nreport, as charged off with a balance of $2,662, as alleged. (AE K at 28) This account \ndoes not appear on the other November 2022 credit reports. (AE J, AE L) Based on the \ninformation in the credit report, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c appear to be two separate accounts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($176) is a retail credit account that has been charged off. (Item 4 at 3 \nItem 5 at 2) It has been paid. (AE A, AE I) \nIn her background interview, Applicant said she had not prioritized her debts but \nfor the ones for which she had set up payment plans, because she could not afford it.

She had not taken on new debt but did not have \na budget or a financial plan. (Item 3 at 5) There is no indication that she has participated \nin financial counseling, per se, but she is a professional financial analyst, so she likely \nhas had professional financial training. Applicant gave no details about her current \nfinances in her SOR Reply beyond her credit reports, which largely show that she is \ncurrent on her payments. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant fell behind on her debts in 2014 or 2015, after her daughter and her \ndaughter\u2019s boyfriend moved in with their child. Her debts are established by the credit \nreports in the record, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The record did not establish that they \nare the same debt. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has some application. Applicant incurred these debts several years \nago, while she was helping out her family financially. Her current credit reports show good \nfinancial stability. SOR \u00b6 1.a, the repossession debt, however, is still a \u201ccontinuing course \nof conduct\u201d as it is an ongoing, unresolved delinquent debt, so it can be considered recent \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). \nApplicant experienced financial problems and fell behind on her debts several \nyears ago after she took in her daughter, her daughter\u2019s boyfriend and their child, and \nassumed full financial responsibility for them. They had agreed to help out but did not do \nso. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application given this circumstance beyond her control.  \nApplicant returned a vehicle but was left with a $22,000 balance afterwards. She \ntook no action to inquire about the debt with the creditor since then, and said she did not \nintend to do, in the hopes that it would fall off of her credit reports. The Appeal Board has \nheld that a debt dropping from a credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt \nresolution. ISCR Case No. 14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016). Applicant has not \nundertaken good-faith, reasonable efforts to address SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is being paid and SOR \u00b6 1.d has been paid. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to those \ndebts. Applicant did not establish that SOR \u00b6 1.c is the same debt as SOR \u00b6 1.b. These \ntwo debts have different account numbers and are listed separately on both credit reports \nsubmitted by the Government. SOR \u00b6 1.c. is unresolved as Applicant did not provide \nsufficient documentary evidence to show otherwise. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) nor 20(e) apply. \nApplicant does not keep a budget and did not establish that she has participated in \nfinancial counseling. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the security \nconcern shown by her delinquent debts. This does not mean that she cannot show such \nevidence in the future. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to her eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.l), except for \u00b6 1.d. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 56 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since November 2019, as an information systems security officer. Since 2004, he has worked for various federal contractors. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is married, since December 2020, and has one minor child. He has held a security clearance since approximately 2002. (Items 2-3). The SOR alleged Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013, resulting in a discharge in July 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); incurred nine delinquent debts, comprised of student loans and consumer debts totaling $177,801 (of which approximately $160,000 derive from his student loans) (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j); and failed to file his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns (\u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.l). Court records establish that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013 and his dischargeable debts were discharged later that year. He listed assets of approximately $65,000 and liabilities of over $181,000 in his petition. Included in his liabilities, were approximately $100,000 of delinquent student loans. They were not discharged. Applicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. (Items 3-4, 11) Applicant admitted having delinquent student loan",

The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines effective June 8, 2017 (AG). \nOn October 12, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

The evidence included in the FORM is identified as Items 2-11 \n(Item 1 includes pleadings and transmittal information). The FORM was received by \nApplicant on November 30, 2022. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit \nany response. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.l), except for \u00b6 \n1.d. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 56 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a defense \ncontractor, since November 2019, as an information systems security officer. Since \n2004, he has worked for various federal contractors. He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree. He \nis married, since December 2020, and has one minor child. He has held a security \nclearance since approximately 2002. (Items 2-3). \nThe SOR alleged Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013, resulting \nin a discharge in July 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); incurred nine delinquent debts, comprised of \nstudent loans and consumer debts totaling $177,801 (of which approximately $160,000 \nderive from his student loans) (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.j); and failed to file his 2019 and 2020 federal \nand state income tax returns (\u00b6\u00b6 1.k-1.l). \nCourt records establish that Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013 \nand his dischargeable debts were discharged later that year. He listed assets of \napproximately $65,000 and liabilities of over $181,000 in his petition. Included in his \nliabilities, were approximately $100,000 of delinquent student loans. They were not \ndischarged. Applicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. \n(Items 3-4, 11) \nApplicant admitted having delinquent student loans of approximately $159,000 in \nhis SOR answer. He further stated that he was \u201cPending to make arrangements for \nmonthly payments.\u201d He failed to provide any evidence that he set up any payment plans \nfor his student loans. His student loans were initially placed in collection in June 2014. \nApplicant claimed the loans were then put in deferment for a period. They were \nsubsequently placed in collection in June 2018. (Items 4, 6, 8; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted failing to file his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He claimed the reason he failed to file was because he owed federal taxes in \nthe amount of over $6,000 and he did not have the funds to pay. He produced no \nevidence that he has subsequently filed his federal and state tax returns. Since \nApplicant\u2019s owing of federal taxes for 2019 was not alleged in the SOR, I will not use \nthat information for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it as it relates to the \napplicability of any mitigating conditions and in my whole-person assessment.

(\u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.j) He admitted these debts in his background \ninterview and in his SOR answer, except for \u00b6 1.d, which he denied. That debt no longer \nappears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports and is resolved for him. The remaining debts are \nreported as delinquent debts in credit reports from February 2020, July 2021, and \nNovember 2022. He provided no documentary evidence showing that he contacted the \ncreditors, established payment plans, or paid any of the remaining debts. (Items 3-8; \nSOR answer) \nApplicant cited a number of reasons leading to his financial difficulties. These \nreasons included being told to reestablish his credit after his bankruptcy by using credit \ncards, experiencing job layoffs, having low paying jobs, being involved in a serious car \naccident, and having to deal with the death of his parents. He indicated that he sought \nfinancial counseling with a debt relief company, but failed to produce any documentation \nreflecting any actions he or the company took on his behalf. Applicant stated during his \nbackground interview in October 2021, that his net monthly income is $2,576 and total \nmonthly expenses of $4,880, leaving a monthly deficit of $2,123. (Items 3-4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had debts discharged by bankruptcy in 2013, has over $150,000 of \ndelinquent student loans, failed to pay other consumer debts, and failed to file his 2019 \nand 2020 federal and state income tax returns. I find all the above disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing and remain unresolved, with the exception of \u00b6 \n1.d, which is resolved in his favor. His federal and state tax returns remain unfiled for \ntax years 2019-2020. He did not provide sufficient evidence to show that his financial \nproblems are unlikely to recur. On the contrary, he currently operates at a monthly \ndeficit, spending more each month than he earns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. He \nnamed several circumstances that were beyond his control that contributed to his \nfinancial problems, however, the evidence does not support a finding that he has taken \nresponsible actions to address his debts or timely file his federal and state tax returns. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not fully apply. \nApplicant failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent \nstudent loans. He received financial counseling through bankruptcy and also hired a \ndebt resolution company. Despite these actions, his financial conditions are not under \ncontrol. He has not shown a good-faith effort to address his debts or his federal and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstate tax issues. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) partially applies, but 20(d) and 20(g) do not apply, except \nas noted above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his personal issues, but I \nalso considered his lack of progress in resolving his debts, and his failure to timely file \nhis 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. Applicant has not established a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He denied \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 2.a and 2.b, the falsification allegations under Guideline E. He provided narrative statements in answering each allegation. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He is not married and he has no children. He graduated from high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but has not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until he was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early 2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to September 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology company.

(Item 1) On September \n20, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. DOHA mailed the \nFORM to Applicant on September 22, 2022, and he received it on September 30, 2022. \nHe was afforded 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. On an unspecified subsequent date, he submitted a response (FORM \nResponse), which included exhibits about his taxes (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) T-1 through \nT-8), his student loans (AE A1 through A12), and other debts (AE D1 through D5). I have \nkept the exhibit numbering system Applicant used in his FORM Response. Department \nCounsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s exhibits, and Applicant did not \nobject to admission of the Government\u2019s exhibits. \nThe case was assigned to me on December 2, 2022. The SOR and the Answer \n(combined as Item 1) are the pleadings in this case. Items 2 through 6 are admitted into \nevidence without objection. Applicant\u2019s FORM Response and exhibits are all admitted \ninto evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, 1.j, and \n1.m; and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l, the financial allegations under Guideline F. \nHe denied \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 2.a and 2.b, the falsification allegations under Guideline E. He \nprovided narrative statements in answering each allegation. His admissions are \nincorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is not married and he has no children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but \nhas not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until \nhe was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early \n2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to \nSeptember 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology \ncompany. He was then unemployed from December 2015 until beginning his current job. \nHe has worked for his employer, a defense contractor, since April 2016. (Items 2, 3) \nGuideline F \nThe SOR debts total about $52,000. They include about $30,000 in past-due \nfederal student loans, about $20,000 in past-due federal income taxes, and about $2,000 \nin other past-due debts. The record includes credit bureau reports (CBRs) from June 2022 \nand November 2021 (Items 5, 6), which, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions, establish the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his August 2021 SCA. He \ndiscussed his taxes and other debts during his November 2021 background interview \n(see discussion under Guideline E, below), and he provided updated information in a May \n2022 interrogatory response. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nThe debts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($4,774), 1.b ($4,680), 1.c ($4,429), 1.d ($3,915), 1.e ($3,734), 1.f \n($3,567), 1.g ($2,736), 1.h ($1,617), and 1.j ($587) are Applicant\u2019s past-due federal \nstudent loans, which, as noted, total about $30,000 combined. \nApplicant explained that he attended college between ages 19 and 24 and needed \nfinancial aid in order to do so. To stay qualified for financial aid, he had to keep his grades \nup, both in college and while later attending community college. He failed to do that, so \nhe attempted to work his way through school. He then successfully pursued an \ninformation technology (IT) certification, and has been with his employer, a government \ncontractor, in his field, ever since. However, he did not earn enough to pay expenses and \nto address his student loan re-payments as well, so he fell behind, and they became \ndelinquent. (Answer, Item 2) \nWhen Applicant contacted the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) in late July \n2022 to ascertain the status of his loans, he was told they were in collection status and \nhe had to file a \u201cDebt Resolution\u201d form to rehabilitate them, pay them in full, or consolidate \nthem. Applicant said he applied to rehabilitate his federal student loans by the end of July \n2022. Once approved, he would be required to make 9 or 10 timely consecutive monthly \npayments to achieve loan rehabilitation. (Answer, Item 2) \nApplicant provided relevant documentation with his FORM Response. He was \napproved for an income-based repayment plan of $5 per month. As of October 2022, he \nmade two $5 payments, in August and September 2022. His loans remained in \u201cdefault\u201d \nstatus as of October 2022, when they were transferred to another loan servicer. (AE A1 \n\u2013 AE A6) \nOn October 15, 2022, Applicant applied for forgiveness of up to $20,000 of his \nfederal student loans under the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s student debt relief plan. (AE \nA7 \u2013 AE A10). That plan was subsequently challenged in federal court, and as of this \nwriting, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is pending. Additionally, the repayment of \nseveral federal student loans have been in forbearance status due to the COVID-19 \npandemic under multiple Presidential Executive Orders since March 2020. Federal \nstudent loan payments remain paused until at least June 30, 2023, and perhaps beyond, \ndue to the Supreme Court case. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($700) is an account placed for collection by a phone company. \nApplicant asserted in his Answer that the account was paid in full and he later provided \ncorroborating documentation. (Item 1; FORM Response; AE D1) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,164) is an account placed for collection by a bank. Applicant denies \nthis debt, and notes that the account was not listed on a July 2022 credit report. That \ncredit report is not in evidence, but the debt is also not listed on a June 2022 credit report \n(Item 5). It is only listed on an earlier credit report, from November 2021. (Item 6) With his \nFORM Response, Applicant provides a credit card excerpt showing that his account with \nthe bank, which has a credit limit of $1,000 and a highest balance of $1,160, is in good \nstanding. (FORM Response; AE D5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($367) is an account placed for collection by a jeweler. (Item 5) Applicant \ndenies the debt and says he has disputed it with the credit bureaus. (Item 2) \nDocumentation he later provided verified his dispute but also the credit bureau\u2019s \nconclusion that the account was valid: \u201cThe information you disputed has been verified \nas accurate.\u201d (AE D2, AE D3) This account is established and remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($20,000) concerns Applicant\u2019s past-due federal income taxes for tax \nyear (TY) 2019. Applicant admitted the allegation with an explanation. He did not disclose \nany federal income tax debt on his August 2021 SCA, but he reported in his November \n2021 background interview that, in November 2021, he received a letter from the U.S. \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that he owed $20,000 in federal income taxes from \nTY 2019. He said he did not list it on his SCA because he had just found out about it. \n(Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant lives in a state on the U.S. east coast. He indicated in his Answer that \nhis 2019 tax returns were prepared by a tax preparer, Ms. M, in a state in the \nsouthwestern U.S., with a nationally known tax preparation service. The reason why he \nretained an out-of-state tax preparer is not provided. He asserted that he had never owed \ntaxes in the past and owing taxes for TY 2019 was out of character. (Answer, Item 2) \nWith his FORM Response, Applicant provided a series of text messages between \nhimself and Ms. M, apparently from earlier in 2022, in which he repeatedly sought \ninformation on the status of his taxes, noting that his clearance was in jeopardy. (FORM \nResponse; AE T-1 to AE T-7) Ms. M provided a letter (undated, though probably from \n2022), noting that she is her own tax preparation service (in the southwestern state). She \nexplained that Applicant retained her in mid-January 2022 \u201cto settle any clerical errors \nthat involve [Applicant] and his 2019 federal taxes.\u201d She asserted that he first contacted \nher in November 2021 after he received a letter from the IRS. She asserted that he does \nnot owe any taxes and the error resulted from \u201cthe removal of the Earned Income Tax \nCredit\u201d for 2019 due to verification of his employment. She asserted that she expects the \nIRS will soon verify that the problem has been corrected and that Applicant will receive a \nrefund instead of owing past-due taxes. (AE T-8) Ms. M provides no documentation about \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 federal taxes, to include any tax return, correspondence, or \ndocumentation of her interactions with the IRS to resolve the matter. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) with his May 2022 \ninterrogatory response. He reported net monthly income of just under $3,500 and monthly \nexpenses and debt payments of a combined $3,525, leaving a small negative remainder. \nHe did not list any payments for his SOR debts on his PFS. (Item 4) \nGuideline E \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. (Item 2) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose that information, in answer to certain questions about his financial \nrecord. Applicant denied the allegations of deliberate falsification. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a concerns the following two questions on Applicant\u2019s August 2021 SCA \nunder: \nSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine \nAccounts: Other than previously listed, have any of the following \nhappened?: \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection\nagency\u201d [and] \n \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. \nAll of the debts Applicant allegedly omitted (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, 1.j-1.l) are debts that \nwere turned over to a collection agency. (Items 5, 6) None of them involved suspended, \ncharged-off, or cancelled accounts. Thus, as to SOR \u00b6 2.a, only the first question above \nis applicable. \nApplicant said he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his USDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but \n[says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were in collections.\u201d He recalled applying for \nrepayment and forbearance. He denied intentional falsification, noting his belief that \u201cthe \nsecurity department\u201d had access to that information \u201cbecause the loans belong to the \nUnited States Federal Government.\u201d (Item 1, Answer, SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b concerns Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to disclose that he had failed to pay \nhis $20,000 in federal taxes from TY 2019. (SOR \u00b6 1.m) As to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant said \nhe was advised by his tax preparer \u201cto not accept fault until it was 100% determined that \nI actually owe.\u201d (Item 1, Answer, SOR \u00b6 2.b) \nIn his background interview, Applicant voluntarily disclosed the November 2021 \nletter he received from the IRS and noted that he had only then learned about his $20,000 \ntax debt for TY 2019. Applicant then denied any other delinquencies, before being \nconfronted with his federal student loans in collection, along with his other past-due debts. \n(Item 3 at 5) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise financial security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant incurred about $30,000 in past-due federal student loans and some other \ndelinquencies. The debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nIn November 2021, Applicant received a letter from the IRS regarding $20,000 in \npast-due federal income taxes for TY 2019. The letter is not in the record, but he disclosed \nthe matter in his November 2021 background interview and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.m, \nconcerning that debt. That admission and disclosure is sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) \nand 19(f) as to SOR \u00b6 1.m. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans remained past due and in default status at the \ntime he responded to the FORM. He has not yet resolved or successfully disputed his \n$20,000 federal tax debt from TY 2019. These debts remain ongoing and unresolved. As \nsuch, they continue to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should \napply. Similarly, he has not shown under AG \u00b6 20(d) that he initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. Applicant has not participated in credit \ncounseling and has not established that his debts are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant challenges the IRS\u2019s conclusion that he owes $19,000 in past-due taxes \nfrom TY 2019, but he provided insufficient evidence, such as corroborating \ndocumentation, to support his claim. The uncorroborated opinion of his tax preparer that \nhe will eventually receive a refund is insufficient. Applicant also challenge the validity of \nthe debt at SOR \u00b6 1.l and was told that the debt remains valid. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence, particularly documentary evidence, \nto establish that he \u201chas made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or \npay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. Under Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s \nfailures to disclose that information, in answer to two questions about routine \ndelinquencies (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and another question concerning failure to pay federal, state, \nor other taxes, as required, (SOR \u00b6 2.b) were deliberately false. \nApplicant denied both allegations of deliberate falsification. When a falsification \nallegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An \napplicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant to determining whether a failure \nto disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant asserted in his Answer that he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his \nUSDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but [says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were \nin collections.\u201d I conclude that it is not established that he omitted them deliberately in \nanswer to a question about debts reported to a collection agency. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant indicated in his November 2021 background interview \nthat earlier that month, he had received a letter from the IRS informing him that he owed \n$20,000 in past-due federal income taxes for TY 2019. He volunteered this information in \nhis interview and also asserted that this letter was the first he had heard of this debt. If \nthis is correct, he was not aware of his federal tax debt when he prepared his SCA two \nmonths before, in August 2021. I conclude that deliberate falsification as to SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nnot established. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, either \nhis federal student loans in default or his past-due federal income taxes. He provided \nsufficient evidence to explain or mitigate his lack of candor about his debts on his SCA. \nHe needs to establish that he has addressed, or is addressing, his past-due debts in a \nresponsible way, through evidence of a track record of steady payments and financial \nstability, and he has not yet done so. Since Applicant did not request a hearing, I had no \nopportunity to question him about his debts, or to assess the reasonableness of his \nactions to address them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude \nthat while personal conduct security concerns are not established, financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l, 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h, 1.j, and 1.m; and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l, the financial allegations under Guideline F. He denied \u00b6\u00b6 SOR 2.a and 2.b, the falsification allegations under Guideline E. He provided narrative statements in answering each allegation. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He graduated from high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but has not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until he was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early 2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to September 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology company. He was then unemployed from December 2015 until beginning his current job. He has worked for his employer, a defense contractor, since April 2016. (Items 2, 3) Guideline F The SOR debts total about $52,000. They include about $30,000 in past-due federal student loans, about $20,000 in past-due federal income taxes, and about $2,000 in other past-due debts.

(Item 1) On September \n20, 2022, DOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 through 6. DOHA mailed the \nFORM to Applicant on September 22, 2022, and he received it on September 30, 2022. \nHe was afforded 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. On an unspecified subsequent date, he submitted a response (FORM \nResponse), which included exhibits about his taxes (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) T-1 through \nT-8), his student loans (AE A1 through A12), and other debts (AE D1 through D5). I have \nkept the exhibit labeling system Applicant used in his FORM Response. Department \nCounsel did not object to the admission of Applicant\u2019s exhibits, and Applicant did not \nobject to admission of the Government\u2019s exhibits. \nThe SOR and the Answer (combined as Item 1) are the pleadings in this case. \nItems 2 through 6 are the Government\u2019s exhibits and are admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s FORM Response and his exhibits detailed above are all admitted \ninto evidence without objection. \nThe case was assigned to me on December 2, 2022. On March 22, 2023, I issued \na decision denying Applicant\u2019s application for access to classified information. Applicant \nappealed, and on May 25, 2023, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case to me for \na new decision. \nEssentially, the Appeal Board agreed with Applicant\u2019s assertion that he had \nsubmitted certain materials to DOHA by fax on or about November 5, 2023, materials that \nshould have been forwarded to Department Counsel and then to me for consideration of \nwhether they should be entered into the record. The Appeal Board remanded the case to \nme to reopen the record to make that determination and then to issue a new decision. \n(Appeal Board Decision) \nOn May 31, 2023, I emailed the parties and requested that Applicant submit to me \nand to Department Counsel the documents he had faxed to DOHA on or about November \n5, 2023, which were the subject of his appeal. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I) On June 5, 2023, \nhe did so. These new documents are identified, using Applicant\u2019s labeling system as \nbefore, as a cover document about his student loans (AE SL) and three related \ndocuments (AE SL-1, SL-2, and SL-3). (Department Counsel has indicated that he had \nnot received them previously, in November 2022). Department Counsel did not object to \nadmission of these new documents, and they are therefore admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel offered comments about the new submissions (HE II), and I \ngave Applicant a week to respond. Applicant submitted an e-mail in response, on June \n12, 2023 (AE SL-4) and indicated the next day that he had no supporting documentation \nto provide. AE SL-4 is admitted without objection.

He \nprovided narrative statements in answering each allegation. His admissions are \nincorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He graduated \nfrom high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but \nhas not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until \nhe was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early \n2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to \nSeptember 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology \ncompany. He was then unemployed from December 2015 until beginning his current job. \nHe has worked for his employer, a defense contractor, since April 2016. (Items 2, 3) \nGuideline F \nThe SOR debts total about $52,000. They include about $30,000 in past-due \nfederal student loans, about $20,000 in past-due federal income taxes, and about $2,000 \nin other past-due debts. The record includes credit bureau reports (CBRs) from June 2022 \nand November 2021 (Items 5, 6), which, along with Applicant\u2019s admissions, establish the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his August 2021 SCA. He \ndiscussed his taxes and other debts during his November 2021 background interview \n(see discussion under Guideline E, below), and he provided updated information in a May \n2022 interrogatory response. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nThe debts are detailed as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($4,774), 1.b ($4,680), 1.c ($4,429), 1.d ($3,915), 1.e ($3,734), 1.f \n($3,567), 1.g ($2,736), 1.h ($1,617), and 1.j ($587) are Applicant\u2019s past-due federal \nstudent loans, which, as noted, total about $30,000 combined. \nIn his previous submissions, Applicant explained that he attended college between \nages 19 and 24 and needed financial aid in order to do so. To stay qualified for financial \naid, he had to keep his grades up, both in college and while later attending community \ncollege. He failed to do that, so he attempted to work his way through school. He then \nsuccessfully pursued an information technology (IT) certification, and has been with his \nemployer, a government contractor, in his field, ever since. However, he did not earn \nenough to pay expenses and to address his student loan re-payments as well, so he fell \nbehind, and they became delinquent.

Applicant said he applied to rehabilitate his federal student loans by the end of July \n2022. Once approved, he would be required to make 9 or 10 timely consecutive monthly \npayments to achieve loan rehabilitation. (Answer, Item 2) \nApplicant provided relevant documentation with his FORM Response. He was \napproved for an income-based repayment plan of $5 per month. As of October 2022, he \nhad made two $5 payments, in August and September 2022. His loans remained in \n\u201cdefault\u201d status as of October 2022, when they were transferred to another loan servicer. \n(AE A1 \u2013 AE A6) \nThe documents Applicant submitted on remand show that his student loan \naccounts were in good standing as of August 12, 2022, September 24, 2022, and October \n24, 2022. He is to pay $5.00 each month. (AE SL, SL-1, SL-2, and SL-3). AE SL-1 \nprovides details of his nine student loan accounts, and shows that as of August 2022, he \nowed about $27,625 in unpaid principal. There was no interest rate. (AE SL-1) \nIn his June 12 e-mail, Applicant addresses his student loans by noting that they \nare no longer delinquent since he is participating in the loan rehabilitation program. He \nsaid the loans were in forbearance from 2014 to 2016 and became delinquent in 2017 or \n2018. He asserted that the USDOE had an outdated address and phone number for him. \n(AE SL-4) (If so, it was his responsibility to keep them informed of his proper contact \ndetails). He asserts that he addressed the matter once he became aware of it. (AE SL-4) \nOn October 15, 2022, Applicant applied for forgiveness of up to $20,000 of his \nfederal student loans under the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s student debt relief plan. (AE \nA7 \u2013 AE A10). That plan was subsequently challenged in federal court, and as of this \nwriting, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is pending. \nAdditionally, the repayment of several federal student loans have been in \nforbearance status due to the COVID-19 pandemic under multiple Presidential Executive \nOrders since March 2020. The USDOE recently announced that federal student loan \nrepayments will resume in October 2023. https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($700) is an account placed for collection by a phone company. \nApplicant asserted in his Answer that the account was paid in full and he later provided \ncorroborating documentation. (Item 1; FORM Response; AE D1) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,164) is an account placed for collection by a bank. Applicant denies \nthis debt, and notes that the account was not listed on a July 2022 credit report. That \ncredit report is not in evidence, but the debt is also not listed on a June 2022 credit report \n(Item 5). It is only listed on an earlier credit report, from November 2021.

(FORM Response; AE D5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($367) is an account placed for collection by a jewelry store. (Item 5) \nApplicant denies the debt and says he has disputed it with the credit bureaus. (Item 2) \nDocumentation he later provided verified his dispute, but it also shows the credit bureau\u2019s \nconclusion that the account was valid: \u201cThe information you disputed has been verified \nas accurate.\u201d (AE D2, AE D3) This account is established and remains unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m ($20,000) concerns Applicant\u2019s past-due federal income taxes for tax \nyear (TY) 2019. Applicant admitted the allegation with an explanation. He did not disclose \nany federal income tax debt on his August 2021 SCA, but he reported in his November \n2021 background interview that, in November 2021, he received a letter from the U.S. \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that he owed $20,000 in federal income taxes from \nTY 2019. He said he did not list it on his SCA because he had just found out about it. \n(Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant lives in a state on the U.S. east coast. He indicated in his Answer that \nhis 2019 tax returns were prepared by a tax preparer, Ms. M, in a state in the \nsouthwestern U.S., with a nationally known tax preparation service. The reason why he \nretained an out-of-state tax preparer is not provided. He asserted that he had never owed \ntaxes in the past and owing taxes for TY 2019 was out of character. (Answer, Item 2) \nWith his FORM Response, Applicant provided a series of text messages between \nhimself and Ms. M, apparently from earlier in 2022, in which he repeatedly sought \ninformation on the status of his taxes, noting that his clearance was in jeopardy. (FORM \nResponse; AE T-1 to AE T-7) Ms. M provided a letter (undated, though probably from \n2022), noting that she is her own tax preparation service (in the southwestern state). She \nexplained that Applicant retained her in mid-January 2022 \u201cto settle any clerical errors \nthat involve [Applicant] and his 2019 federal taxes.\u201d She asserted that he first contacted \nher in November 2021 after he received a letter from the IRS. She asserted that he does \nnot owe any taxes and the error resulted from \u201cthe removal of the Earned Income Tax \nCredit\u201d for 2019 due to verification of his employment. She asserted that she expects the \nIRS will soon verify that the problem has been corrected and that Applicant will receive a \nrefund instead of owing past-due taxes. (AE T-8) Ms. M provides no documentation about \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 federal taxes, to include any tax return, correspondence, or \ndocumentation of her interactions with the IRS to resolve the matter. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2022 faxed documents that DOHA did not receive prior to \nthe original decision in this case concerned his student loans and did not concern his \ntaxes or other debts. \nIn his June 12, 2023 e-mail, Applicant explained that he had no new documentary \nevidence about his federal tax debt to provide.

He reported net monthly income of just under $3,500 and monthly \nexpenses and debt payments of a combined $3,525, leaving a small negative remainder. \nHe did not list any payments for his SOR debts on his PFS. (Item 4) He provided no \nupdated information about his income, expenses, or debt payments on remand, except \nas noted. \nGuideline E \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. (Item 2) SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b allege that Applicant deliberately \nfailed to disclose that information, in answer to certain questions about his financial \nrecord. Applicant denied the allegations of deliberate falsification. (Item 1) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a concerns the following two questions on Applicant\u2019s August 2021 SCA \nunder: \nSection 26 \u2013 Financial Record \u2013 Delinquency Involving Routine \nAccounts: Other than previously listed, have any of the following \nhappened?: \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had bills or debts turned over to a collection \nagency\u201d [and] \nIn the past seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed. \nAll of the debts Applicant allegedly omitted (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, 1.j-1.l) are debts that \nwere turned over to a collection agency. (Items 5, 6) None of them involved suspended, \ncharged-off, or cancelled accounts. Thus, as to SOR \u00b6 2.a, only the first question above \nis applicable. \nApplicant said he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his USDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but \n[says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were in collections.\u201d He recalled applying for \nrepayment and forbearance. He denied intentional falsification, noting his belief that \u201cthe \nsecurity department\u201d had access to that information \u201cbecause the loans belong to the \nUnited States Federal Government.\u201d (Item 1, Answer, SOR \u00b6 2.a) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.b concerns Applicant\u2019s alleged failure to disclose that he had failed to pay \nhis $20,000 in federal taxes from TY 2019.

Applicant then denied any other delinquencies, before being \nconfronted with his federal student loans in collection, along with his other past-due debts. \n(Item 3 at 5) \nApplicant did not specifically address the Guideline E allegations further on \nremand, and the related facts above are unchanged from the original decision in this case. \nApplicant closed his June 12 email by asserting that he has held a clearance for \nthe last 10 years without issue or incident, and with no issue about his character or \ntrustworthiness until now. He recognizes that it is privilege to hold a clearance and \nunderstands the values expected of clearance holders. He asserted that every clearance \nholder has made mistakes and can turn it into a lesson learned. He said he did not \nintentionally disregard the rules and expectations of clearance holders. (AE SL-4) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise financial security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant incurred about $30,000 in past-due federal student loans and some other \ndelinquencies. The debts in the SOR are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record.

The letter is not in the record, but he disclosed \nthe matter in his November 2021 background interview and admitted SOR \u00b6 1.m, \nconcerning that debt. That admission and disclosure is sufficient to satisfy AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) \nand 19(f) as to SOR \u00b6 1.m. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans are now in rehabilitation, as of October 2022. \nHowever, there is no record evidence that Applicant took steps to address his student \nloans before receiving the SOR. Further, he is under a repayment plan of $5 per month \non a $27,000 debt load. If this plan continues, it will take years to repay the debt. Further, \nApplicant has taken little to no real steps towards addressing or challenging his $20,000 \nfederal tax debt from TY 2019. These debts remain ongoing and unresolved. As such, \nthey continue to cast doubt on his current judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(a) should apply. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should \napply. His assertions that his tax preparer has been \u201clackluster\u201d in addressing his tax \nproblems is not enough to show that they did not occur for reasons beyond his control or \nthat he has undertaken good-faith, reasonable efforts to address them. It is too soon to \ntell. Similarly, he has not shown under AG \u00b6 20(d) that he initiated and is adhering to a \ngood-faith effort to pay or resolve his debts. Applicant has not participated in credit \ncounseling and has not established that his debts are being resolved or are under control. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant challenges the IRS\u2019s conclusion that he owes $19,000 in past-due taxes \nfrom TY 2019, but he provided insufficient evidence, such as corroborating \ndocumentation, to support his claim. The uncorroborated opinion of his tax preparer that \nhe will eventually receive a refund is insufficient. Indeed, the fact that the IRS kept his \nrefund from tax year 2022 to address his prior year tax debt refutes this. Applicant also \nchallenges the validity of the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.l and was told that the debt remains valid. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence, particularly documentary evidence, \nto establish that he \u201chas made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority to file or \npay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(g) does \nnot apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 sets forth the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes \non his August 2021 SCA. Under Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant\u2019s \nfailures to disclose that information, in answer to two questions about routine \ndelinquencies (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and another question concerning failure to pay federal, state, \nor other taxes, as required, (SOR \u00b6 2.b) were deliberately false.\n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant denied both allegations of deliberate falsification. When a falsification \nallegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has the burden of proving it. \nAn omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the \ntime of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An \napplicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant to determining whether a failure \nto disclose relevant information on a security clearance application was deliberate. ISCR \nCase No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant asserted in his Answer that he \u201cwas aware\u201d that his \nUSDOE student loans \u201cwere past due but [says he] wasn\u2019t aware that the accounts were \nin collections.\u201d I conclude that it is not established that he omitted them deliberately in \nanswer to a question about debts reported to a collection agency. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 2.b, Applicant indicated in his November 2021 background interview \nthat earlier that month, he had received a letter from the IRS informing him that he owed \n$20,000 in past-due federal income taxes for TY 2019. He volunteered this information in \nhis interview and also asserted that this letter was the first he had heard of this debt. If \nthis is correct, he was not aware of his federal tax debt when he prepared his SCA two \nmonths before, in August 2021. I conclude that deliberate falsification as to SOR \u00b6 2.b is \nnot established. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant provided sufficient evidence to explain or mitigate his lack of candor \nabout his debts on his SCA. However, his actions to address his student loans and federal \ntax debt is recent and insubstantial. It is therefore insufficient to establish that he has \naddressed, or is addressing, his past-due debts in a responsible way, through evidence \nof a track record of steady payments and financial stability. Since Applicant did not \nrequest a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about his debts, or to assess the \nreasonableness of his actions to address them. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude that while personal conduct security concerns are not established, \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l, 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, \nand exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014. He married in \n2014 and has two children, ages seven and four. He has worked for his present employer, \na federal contractor, since 2018. (Tr. 17-19, 32) \nApplicant was self-employed from 2007 to 2014 while attending college. He \nworked at various jobs that dealt with the sale of real estate, such as a notary support \nspecialist, a processor, and a mortgage counselor. In July 2014, he decided to become a \nreal estate investor and would purchase property and resell it at a profit. He learned this \nwas a very competitive career, and he was unable to maintain a stable income. He began \nfalling behind on his financial obligations and used credit to help pay his bills. In June \n2016, he decided to become a real estate agent to obtain financial stability. He was \nlicensed in three jurisdictions. He continued to fall behind in his financial obligations. He \nworked part-time jobs to pay his bills. He was unable to live off the income he was earning. \nApplicant testified that while experiencing financial hardship, he reached out to his \ncreditors to resolve his debts, but he was unable to make the payments they proposed. \n(Tr. 22-31; GE 2; Answer to SOR) \nIn 2017, Applicant decided to change careers and go into information technology \n(IT). He worked part-time at a small media company, Apple, and Instacart. He was able \nto continue to work part-time after becoming a full-time employee with his present \nemployer in 2018 but in 2019 he was no longer able to maintain his part-time jobs due to \nthe demands of his full-time work schedule. (Tr. 18-30) \nApplicant testified that his wife worked temporary jobs for a period but did not work \nfor periods when she was pregnant and after their children were born. She presently \nworks for a company as a temporary employee and anticipates being hired in a permanent \nposition, which would increase her income. (Tr. 18-21, 28-29) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background investigation with a government investigator in \nJanuary 2022, he stated that in May 2019 he hired a credit repair company and some of \nhis debts were removed, and Applicant did not have any further obligation toward them. \nHe also said some were charged-off and he had no further obligation to the creditor. He \ntestified that he also received some financial counseling from the credit repair company. \n(Tr. 55-57; GE 2) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant explained that he and his wife reduced their spending and moved so they \nwould pay less for rent but are still living paycheck to paycheck. His goal is to complete \ncertifications in his field that will allow him to advance in his career and potentially increase \nhis income. He hopes that once his income increases, he will be able to address his \ndelinquent debts. He acknowledges that he is responsible for the debts and wants to \nrepay them. He said he would need to double his current income to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. (Tr. 27-31, 41-49 \nApplicant testified that he continues to struggle financially and often at the end of \nthe month he does not have sufficient income to pay all of his bills. He and his wife share \na vehicle. His mother-in-law provides day care for the children. They have no savings. \n(Tr. 30-31) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts. During Applicant\u2019s interview with a \ngovernment investigator in January 2022, he explained the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($17,723) \nand 1.d ($5,590) are lines of credit with the same creditor. He was unable to negotiate a \nsettlement with the creditor. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($9,870), 1.c ($5,603) and 1.e \n($9,371) are credit-card accounts. Applicant testified that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f is a \ncharged-off student loan ($25,000). He told the investigator he believed that he was no \nlonger responsible for it as it had been removed from his credit report and charged-off. At \nhis hearing, he acknowledged it was likely held by a third-party collector. Applicant \ntestified that none of these SOR delinquent debts are resolved or paid. He said he intends \nto repay them when he is able. (Tr. 41, 45, 51; GE 2) \nApplicant\u2019s current annual income was approximately $60,000 in 2018 and has \nincrementally increased to approximately $72,000 for this year. He earns about $3,000 to \n$5,000 from part-time jobs. His wife began working full-time three months ago and earns \nabout $30,000 annually. They have no investments, except his pension to which he \ncontributes. They live within their means and have no new debts. Applicant owes \napproximately $87,000 for student loans that are deferred. His wife owes approximately \n$30,000 for student loans that are deferred. They have applied for income-based \nrepayment plans. (Tr. 18-21, 34-40, 49-55) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has approximately $73,157 in delinquent debt that he is unable to pay. \nThere is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant began experiencing financial difficulties in about 2016 when he decided \nto become an entrepreneur in the real estate market, first buying and selling real estate \nand then as an agent. He was unable to keep up with his financial obligations and used \nlines of credit and credit cards that he was unable to repay. He has not paid, resolved, or \nsettled any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His debts are recent and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant chose to enter the real estate business attempting to make a profit \nbuying and selling property and then as a real estate agent. He was unsuccessful but it \nwas a personal choice he made to participate in a highly competitive career. This was \nwithin his control. He used credit cards and lines of credit when he was unable to meet \nhis financial obligations. This was also within his control. Applicant is unable to pay his \ncreditors. Although he testified that he intends to repay his creditors in the future when he \nis able, he does not have a realistic plan at this point. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant stated he received some financial counseling from the credit repair company \nwith whom he worked. However, there are no clear indications that his financial problems \nare being resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. The record evidence leaves me with serious \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant attributes her difficulty with keeping up with her debts to the difficulties of making ends meet as a single mother of two children.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 30, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nServices (DODCAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, and Guideline E, personal conduct, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant her security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAS took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the Nat. Sec. Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility \nfor Access to Classified Information (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn October 31, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR allegations, admitting all of the \nallegations, except SOR subparagraph 3.d, and requested a decision on the written \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord instead of a hearing.  On November 30, 2022, the Government prepared a File of \nRelevant Material (FORM), consisting of a brief, together with six attachments (Items 1 \u2013 \n6) in support of its position. Applicant received a copy of the FORM on December 1, 2022, \nand was given 30 days to file a response. Applicant did not file a response, and on \nJanuary 30, 2023, the case was assigned to me. On May 12, 2023, I re-opened the record \nsua sponte, extending it through May 30, 2023, to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit exhibits. Applicant did not submit any exhibits, whereupon, I closed the record on \nMay 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 33-year-old, single woman with two children, ages 14 and 6. She is \na high school graduate and has taken some college courses. (Item 2 at 10) She has been \nworking for a federal government contractor as a security alarms dispatcher since 2021 \n(Item 2 at 12). \nOver the years, Applicant incurred approximately $58,000 of delinquent debt. \n(Answer at 5) Approximately $54,000 consists of student loan debt, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, a credit card account, as alleged in subparagraph 1.c, and a \nmedical bill, as alleged in subparagraph 1.d. Applicant attributes her difficulty with keeping \nup with her debts to the difficulties of making ends meet as a single mother of two children. \n(Item 2 at 4) The credit account alleged in subparagraph 1.c, totaling, $1,921, was \nopened, unbeknownst to her, by her ex-boyfriend, an authorized card user, and she \nincurred the medical bill, alleged in subparagraph 1.d, totaling $1,333, after a car \naccident. \nApplicant contends that she applied for a student loan debt relief plan that will \nforgive $20,000 of the debt, and she promised to set up a payment plan to satisfy the \nremainder once the $20,000 was forgiven. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant provided no proof of a \nloan forgiveness application, nor did she provide proof that part of her student loan debt \nhas been forgiven, or that she has arranged a payment plan. \nApplicant closed the account alleged in subparagraph 1.c, and contends that she \nwill pay the balance once she receives an insurance settlement from an automobile \naccident in which she was involved. (Item 1 at 4) Similarly, Applicant contends that she \nwill satisfy the medical bill, as alleged in subparagraph 1.d, after she receives the \nsettlement. \nIn September 2008, while at home breastfeeding her newborn child, Applicant\u2019s \nthen boyfriend began to beat her. Attempting to escape his abuse, Applicant ran to her \nkitchen. Her then boyfriend chased her into the kitchen and did not stop attempting to \nbeat her until she grabbed a kitchen knife and cut him. (Item 1 at 4) Subsequently, he \ncontacted the police, who arrested Applicant the next day, and charged her with \npossessing an instrument of a crime, simple assault, aggravated assault, reckless \nendangering, terroristic threats, harassment, and attempted criminal homicide.

(Item 6 \nat 7) Applicant no longer has contact with her ex-boyfriend. (Item 6 at 7) \nOne morning before going to work, Applicant\u2019s mother, who typically took care of \nApplicant\u2019s child while she was at work, called and told her that she was running late. \nAfraid to be late to work, Applicant contacted a neighbor who agreed to watch the child \nuntil Applicant\u2019s mother arrived. Applicant then left for work and told the neighbor to enter \nthe home through the unlocked back door. \nThe neighbor did not come to the home immediately, as promised. (Item 1 at 4) \nWhile no caregivers were present, Applicant\u2019s child, then eight years old, attempted to \ncook food, and started a fire. Ultimately, the child exited the house without being harmed, \nand his grandmother arrived before the fire could spread. Applicant, however, was \ncharged with endangering the welfare of a child, and recklessly endangering another \nperson. After completing 40 hours of court-ordered volunteer work, the charges were \ndismissed. (Item 4 at 4) \nIn the fall of 2020, Applicant enrolled her son in a private school. (Item 1 at 4) \nFrustrated with the harder schoolwork and the transfer, in general, Applicant\u2019s son \nbecame rebellious, frequently misbehaving in school and not performing his assigned \ntasks. Applicant disciplined him by periodically taking away his video games, his cell \nphone, his laptop computer, and his extracurricular activities. (Item 1 at 5) In June 2020, \nafter the principal notified Applicant that he was going to expel her son, Applicant whipped \nher son five to six times with a switch. (Item 4 at 11) \nThe next day, Applicant told a classmate, who then told a school administrator. \nSubsequently, child protective services initiated an investigation and discovered welts on \nApplicant\u2019s child\u2019s legs that were indicative of the type of beating that he described to his \nclassmate. Subsequently, in July 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with \npossessing an instrument of a crime, simple assault, aggravated assault, and \nendangering the welfare of a child. (Item 1 at 4) Applicant voluntarily began parenting \nclasses. Later, she pleaded guilty to simple assault, and agreed to continue the parenting \nclasses and attend therapy, as part of probation. (1 at 5) After she completed these steps, \nthe child protective services case was closed and the criminal case was dismissed. (Item \n1 at 11) \nIn December 2015, Applicant was fired from her job for bringing her child to work, \nas alleged in subparagraph 3.b. (Item 1 at 6) In April 2017, and later in September 2019, \nApplicant was fired from her employment for repeated tardiness, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 3.c and 3.d, respectively. (Item 1 at 6) Applicant\u2019s problems with job \nstability resulted from difficulties balancing her work schedule and care for her children, \nas a single parent. Specifically, she could not afford professional daycare and was \ndependent on friends and family to watch her children. If they were late to her home to \npick up her children, she was late to work, or in the situation alleged in subparagraph 3.b, \nif a child-care provider cancelled at the last minute, she had to take her child to work. \n(Item 1 at 12) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to repeated tardiness, Applicant\u2019s employer, as referenced in \nsubparagraph 3.d, fired her for job abandonment. Applicant denied that she abandoned \nthe job and contended that she stopped coming to work after being injured in a car \naccident. Despite successfully applying for leave under the Family Medical Leave Act, \nher employer construed her failure to come to work as job abandonment, and denied her \nrequest for unemployment benefits. Applicant appealed this decision, and the \nunemployment commission ruled in her favor, and concluded that her failure to come to \nwork did not constitute job abandonment. (Item 1 at 12) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant attributes her financial problems to difficulties making ends meet as a single \nmother of two children. Moreover, she incurred one of the debts after her then boyfriend \nused her credit card without her knowledge. Conversely, Applicant did not provide \nsubstantiating evidence for any steps that she was taking to satisfy or otherwise resolve \nher debts. Under these circumstances, the surrounding circumstances which contributed \nto her financial problems trigger the partial application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201c the conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft) . . . \u201c  but \nher failure to detail how she acted responsibly under the circumstances, renders the \nsecond prong inapplicable. Similarly, absent any evidence supporting her claim that \napproximately half of her student loan debt will be forgiven, or any evidence of financial \ncounseling, none of the remaining mitigating conditions are applicable. I conclude that \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness [and] by its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) \nApplicant\u2019s domestic violence charges stemming from the altercation with her ex-\nboyfriend in 2008, the 2016 child endangerment charge, and the 2021 child abuse charge, \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 31(b), \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally prosecuted charged, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 potentially apply: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s charge for assaulting her ex-boyfriend stemmed from an episode that \noccurred 15 years ago. Moreover, Applicant did not cut her ex-boyfriend until after he \nrepeatedly beat her, and until after she tried to run away from him to no avail. The court \nsubsequently dismissed the charges against her.  AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2016 charge related to leaving her child alone in the home occurred \nfrom unusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur, as she made child care plans with \nher mother before leaving the home, then, when her mother informed her she was running \nlate, made child care plans with a neighbor who failed to follow through on a promise to \nwatch her child until her mother arrived. The court dismissed the charges after Applicant \ncompleted volunteer work. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(b) apply. \nThe criminal charges stemming from Applicant\u2019s corporal punishment of her child \nare recent, as the episode did not occur until two months before the issuance of the SOR. \nNevertheless, Applicant, with the assistance of child protective services, successfully \ncompleted the probation requirements, completing parenting classes and therapy, \nleading to the closure of the case. AG \u00b6 32(b) applies, and AG \u00b6 32 (a) is partially \napplicable, in that the behavior does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \nreliability, or good judgment. I conclude Applicant has mitigated the criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nThe conduct alleged in subparagraphs 2.a through 2.c is cross-alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 3.a, and is mitigated for the same reasons, as discussed above. SOR \nsubparagraphs 3.b and 3.c are involve issues of childcare concerns, not security \nconcerns. As such, AG \u00b6 15 does not apply. When Applicant applied for unemployment \nbenefits after her termination from her job in March 2020, the unemployment benefits \ncommission concluded that she did not abandon the job, as alleged by the employer. In \naddition, the repeated tardiness was indicative of childcare problems, rather than issues \nof security concern. I conclude that AG \u00b6 15 does not apply. In sum, I resolve the \nallegations set forth in SOR subparagraphs 3.a through 3.d in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of  the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;(5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant never provided any documents substantiating her contention that \nher debts would either be forgiven or paid through an insurance settlement. Absent \nany such documentation, promises to pay or resolve debts are merely speculative \nand do not satisfy her burden of establishing that the security concerns have been \nmitigated. \n. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.d:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMarc E. Curry \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
