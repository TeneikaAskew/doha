(Tr. pp. 21-22.) \nApplicant explained that his delinquent financial history started during his first \ndeployment in the military. (Tr. p. 32.) Applicant was married to his first wife from 2011 \nto 2015. His wife did not work outside of the home. During his first deployment, his wife \nhad access to his bank account, and was supposed to pay the household bills and keep \neverything current.

She was not educated on how to properly manage finances. She \nmade minimum payments toward some of the debts and others she ignored. At the \ntime of their divorce in 2015, Applicant was indebted in the amount of $60,000. (Tr. pp. \n33 and 39.) \nIn 2017, Applicant married his second wife. At the time they were married, \nApplicant was leaving on deployment, and they never moved in together. She lived with \nher parents and she stayed there. She had access to Applicant\u2019s bank account and she \nwas expected to pay his household bills for him while he was deployed. Unbeknownst \nto the Applicant, she did not pay the bills. Instead, she spent his money on other things, \nbut he is not sure what she purchased. \nDuring his last deployment, Applicant was seriously injured when a forklift hit him \nin the head causing traumatic brain injury, and a broken knee and back. (Tr. p. 22.) In \nMarch 2018, Applicant was discharged from the Air Force. At that time, he moved in \nwith his mother who helped take care of him. He received unemployment benefits, and \nunderwent extensive therapy and rehabilitation at VA medical facilities. (Tr. p. 40.) \nApplicant was not aware of the extent of his financial indebtedness until he started \nreceiving letters from creditors that told him how much debt he owed. By this time, \nApplicant\u2019s debt had increased from $60,000 to $240,000. (Tr. p. 40.) He divorced his \nsecond wife in 2019. (Tr. p. 23.) \nUpon learning of the debt, Applicant contacted each of the creditors to set up a \npayment plan. \nHe also contacted an attorney and was advised to file for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy to discharge his debt. A letter from his attorney dated August 24, 2022, \nconfirms the arrangement. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.) Applicant found it difficult to contact \nthis attorney, and as a result, was not able to make progress towards resolving his \ndebts. (Tr. p. 47.) \nIn May 2023, Applicant hired another law firm to help him. This law \nfirm moved swiftly, and filed the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition in June 2023. \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Tr. p. 48.) Applicant stated that each of the creditors listed in \nthe SOR were named in the in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nC.) The debts are not yet discharged. \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $32,848 for an account \nthat was charged off. This is a delinquent credit card. The debt has been included in \nthe Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition filed in June 2023. The debt remains owing. \n1.b.

Applicant is indebted to a creditor in the amount of $15,269 for an account \nthat was charged off. This is a delinquent credit card. The debt has been included in \nthe Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition filed in June 2023. Applicant believes that this is the \nsame debt listed in 1.h., above. (Tr. p. 52.) It is unclear from the evidence whether this \ndebt is the same debt listed in 1.h., or whether this is a separate debt. The debt \nremains owing. \nApplicant is currently working with his attorney to get his debts discharged as \nsoon as possible. Applicant has learned from this experience and understands that he \nmust be extremely careful in handling his finances to ensure that his bills are always \npaid on time, and that he lives within his means. He stated that he plans to never use \ncredit cards again. \nApplicant has a new girlfriend who works as a Program Manager and earns \nabout $120,000 annually. He stated that she is financially responsible. Applicant earns \nabout $99,000 annually, not including overtime and bonuses. (Tr. p. 19.) They have a \ndaughter who was born in 2021.

Applicant has a 401(k) that has about $34,000 in it. He plans \non marrying his girlfriend in the near future. \nNine letters of recommendation from coworkers and military associates indicate \nthat Applicant is an upstanding citizen and a hard worker. He is always professional \nand respectful. \nHe follows all company rules and regulations concerning how to \nproperly protect classified information. Applicant has given them no reason to question \nhis honestly, trustworthiness and reliability. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debt while in the military on deployment. He was \nunder the impression that his wife at the time, who had access to his bank account, \nwould pay the household bills when in fact his bills were not properly addressed.

Applicant has recently \ndirected his focus at resolving his delinquent debts. \nHe has filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy and is in the process of discharging the debt. Applicant\u2019s serious injury \nduring his last deployment in the military was also a reason for his failure to address his \nfinancial problems immediately upon learning about them. On the surface this appears \nto be a situation where Applicant\u2019s financial irresponsibility and inaction for so long casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. However, a deeper \nanalysis shows that Applicant was not the individual who engaged in reckless spending \nand ignored the bills. In fact, when Applicant realized how indebted he was, he hired \nattorneys to help him. He filed Bankruptcy in June 2023, to discharge the debt. Under \nthe particular circumstances of this case, Applicant has done everything possible to \nresolve his indebtedness as soon as possible. Mitigating conditions (a) through (d) are \napplicable. \nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are being resolved. Overall, Applicant has shown that he is making progress \ntowards resolving his debts. He has filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and is currently \nwaiting for the court to discharge the debts. There is sufficient evidence in the record to \nshow that the Applicant has carried his burden of proof to establish mitigation of the \ngovernment security concerns under Guideline F. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts incurred by his two ex-wifes while he was deployed overseas in the military are \ncurrently listed in a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition filed with the court in June 2023, \nawaiting discharge. Under the circumstances, this shows good judgement, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  through 1.k.  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

During that time, he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree and in September \n2013 started working in his current position. (AX A; GX 1.) \nFrom 2010 until 2015, Applicant attended a university from which he received all \nthree of his degrees. The university offered in-person and online classes. Applicant met \nwith a recruiter at the university who advised him that the payment of the student loans \nthat he was incurring would be an easy and affordable repayment process. At the time \nthat he borrowed the money to fund his higher education, and after completing his course \nof studies in 2015, Applicant did not have a firm understanding of the student-loan \nrepayment process. (AX A; GX 2; Tr.????) \nIt is relevant to note that the practices of the university Applicant attended have \nbeen challenged in multiple lawsuits to include several class actions. Recently, the \nuniversity was part of a class-action lawsuit that claimed the listed schools defrauded their \nstudents through misrepresentations and actions that constituted predatory lending \npractices. The class is comprised of students/former students with federal student loans \nused to attend any of the listed schools who filed or are eligible to file a borrower defense \napplication to oppose repayment of their student loans. The class-action settlement \nreceived final approval on November 16, 2022. https://studentaid.gov \nApproximately six months after graduation, Applicant received his first repayment \nnotice he was stunned by the approximately $1,400 monthly payment. This amount was \napproximately one half of his monthly income and was not affordable for him. He \ncontacted the Department of Education (DOE), which was the creditor of his loan, and \nattempted to work out an affordable repayment agreement. The DOD representative was \nstated that Applicant was required to pay the full monthly payment. Unable to do so, he \ndefaulted student-loan repayments. (AX A; GX 2; Tr.????) \nIn April 2017, DOE began garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages in the approximate amount \nof $260 to $285 every two weeks. DOE also seized Applicant\u2019s federal and state tax \nrefunds. Although he was frustrated by the fact that the total monthly payment through \nthe garnishment was affordable to him and something to which he would have agreed to \ngiven the opportunity, he was, nonetheless relieved that the loans were in repayment. \nInquiry into a loan with habilitation program the information he read stated that he needed \nto make eight consecutive payments to the loan, but he was unable to ascertain whether \nor not the garnishment payments would also continue, thus creating a scenario where he \nwas making a double monthly payment which was not something he was able to afford. \nThe garnishment remained in place until the March 13, 2020, COVID-19 payment pause. \nSee https://studentaid.gov Applicant\u2019s payments total between $16,000 and $17,000. (AX \nA; GX 2; GX 1.) The student-loan debts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, 1.n, and \n1.q. \nIn approximately 2018, in an effort to appease his fianc\u00e9e, Applicant began using \nhis credit cards more frequently for more extravagant entertainment and purchases than \nwas his general practice. At the time, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was contributing to the payments \non the credit cards.

The delinquent credit-card \naccounts are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.m, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.r through 1.v. (GX 2; AX A.) \nIn May 2020, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e terminated their relationship and Applicant moved \nout. He rented a small two-bedroom apartment which he had to furnish in its entirety. His \nthen 16-year-old daughter moved in with him full time and his son, then 9, lived with him \nhalf of the time. Applicant was responsible for the increased living expenses necessarily \nincurred by his children, as well as school-related items such as clothing, backpacks, \nsupplies, etc. (AX A; Tr.????) \nIn spring 2020, Applicant began consulting with several friends, including his direct \nsupervisor, about managing personal finances, including strategies for paying off debt. \nBased on the advice he received, he structured a plan for resolving his debts. He realized \nthat he needed an overall better understanding of how credit worked, so he subscribed \nto a free credit- monitoring program through which he began to study how credit worked \nand closely monitor his credit. (AX A; Tr.???) \nIn approximately May 2020, in accordance with his plan, Applicant determined that \nhe needed to restructure his car-loan debts because he was paying very high interest on \nhis two car loans. He made two withdrawals from his 401(k), each withdrawal was for the \nexact amount of the payoff on each of the two car loans and paid the car loans off. He \nalso contacted DOE to make arrangements to enter a student-loan rehabilitation \nagreement. He then contacted all of the creditors of his delinquent accounts that he was \nable to identify from the list available through his credit-monitoring company. (AX A: \nTr.???) \nIn May 2022, Applicant received a letter from DOE stating that he had successively \nrehabilitated his student loans, that the loans were now in good standing, and that they \nhad been transferred to a loan servicer. The loan servicer consolidated Applicant\u2019s 13 \nloans into a single account with a monthly payment of $223. However, due to the payment \npause, Applicant\u2019s monthly payments are not scheduled to begin until August 31, 2023. \nIn accordance with his repayment agreement, the loan-servicer will annually review \nApplicant\u2019s salary to determine the amount of the monthly payments based on his income. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, 1.n, and 1.q, totaling $106,636, are in good standing.

He did not alter his withholding status and \nwas surprised to learn that he owed approximately $1,800 in state taxes for 2021. He \nsatisfied the tax debt through a monthly-payment plan. (Tr.????) \nIn order to avoid owing state taxes for tax year 2022, Applicant used several online \ntax calculators to ensure that he was withholding the proper amount.

He contacted the state treasurer to make \npayment arrangements prior to April 18, the due date, but was informed that he would \nhave to wait until after the due date for an official statement from the treasurer regarding \nthe amount that he owes. The treasurer stated that official notices will be sent out between \none week and one month after the due date. Once Applicant receives the official notice, \nhe will be able to make payment arrangements. He is awaiting the terms of the repayment \nbefore he obligates himself to repayment of his remaining credit-card debts. In order to \nprevent future state-tax liability, he is having an additional $60 a paycheck deducted for \nhis state taxes. (AX A; Tr.???) \nApplicant contributes $200 a month to his son\u2019s mother for his son\u2019s support as \nwell as providing for the purchase of necessary items such as clothing and school \nsupplies. Applicant drives approximately 180 miles per day to go to and from work. He \nretains ownership of his two older vehicles to ensure that at least one of them is \nmechanically sound enough to make the daily round trip. Because of the age of the \nvehicles and the high usage of them, he routinely has maintenance costs and recently \nspent approximately $500 for new tires on one of his vehicles. \nOn the advice she received in credit counseling, Applicant has been working to \nreestablish her credit. She has opened new credit-card accounts with six of the creditors \nof the SOR debts. She was advised to maintain small balances on several accounts long \nenough for the accounts to be reported, then pay the balance of the accounts. \nAdditionally, Applicant stated that there are several circumstances, such as travel and car \nrental, where a credit card is required.

(AX K.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information\u2026. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

Specifically, coincident with \nreceiving a duplicate payment that was deducted from her pay for three months, \nApplicant\u2019s husband stopped making any financial contributions to the household. \nApplicant was unable to maintain her consumer credit-card payments on her retirement \nand disability pay. However, she maintained her mortgage-loan payments. Applicant and \nher husband separated in 2019. \nWhile attending college, Applicant met with a credit counselor on several \noccasions and learned techniques for addressing delinquent debt. In 2018, Applicant \nbegan contacting her creditors in an effort to pay her smaller accounts and enter \nrepayment plans with the larger accounts. She received seven 1099-Cs that she filed with \nher 2019 and 2020 federal tax returns.. \nApplicant has resolved each of the debts alleged in the SOR through either \ncancellation of debt or repayment. She provided documentation showing the repayment \nof five of the SOR debts. Through the cancellation of debt and the repayment of her \naccounts, Applicant has resolved $41,328 of delinquent debt, which is greater than 73% \nof the SOR debt. She has not recently been contacted by any of the creditors of the SOR \ndebts.

He or she need only establish a plan to resolve financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. The adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an individual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor do they require that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first.

While those granted access to classified information are \nheld to a high standard of conduct, they are not held to a standard of perfection. \nThere is nothing in the record that suggests Applicant is financially reckless or \nirresponsible or that she is likely to disregard her financial obligations in the future. She \nestablished a plan to resolve her debts and has implemented that plan. She lives within \nher means, maintains a budget, and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. She \nmaintains a checking account, savings account, and a retirement account. She has a \npositive net monthly remainder.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the Army for 24 years, including five deployments. \nShe demonstrated her dedication to continuing to serve as a civilian through her pursuit \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof a degree in logistics, the field in which she now works.

Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.v: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

He received the FORM on August 12, \n2022, but did not respond to the FORM. (Items1-4). I was assigned the case on November \n17, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 53-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince September 2008. He is divorced and has no children. He obtained an \nundergraduate degree in May 1990. He reported no military service. He obtained a \nsecurity clearance in 2009. (Item 3) Applicant completed his latest security clearance \napplication (SCA) on September 5, 2018. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline H, \u00b61.a, that Applicant, with varying frequency, \nfrom about March 1999 to at least November 2021, used marijuana after being granted \naccess to classified information in November 2008. (Item 1) Applicant denied the \nallegation in the SOR. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline E,\u00b6 2.a, that Applicant falsified his September \n2008 SCA by responding \u201cNo\u201d to Section 24.a. \u201cSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, \nhave you illegally used \nany controlled substance, narcotics, depressants, \nhallucinogenics, steroids, or prescription drugs, experimenting or otherwise consuming \nany controlled substance\u201d as alleged under Guideline E, in SOR \u00b6 2.b,the SOR cross \nalleged the marijuana use allegation in \u00b6 1.a. Applicant denied these allegations in the \nSOR. (Item 2) \nIn his answer, Applicant denied the SOR allegation that he used marijuana with \nvarying frequency from about 1999 to at least 2021and stated that he tried marijuana \nonce in 1999 and did not use marijuana again until 2013 when his roommate moved in. \nHe acknowledged that the use of marijuana was after his initial security screening in 2009. \nHe continued to relate that he used it about a handful of times, with the last time being \nThanksgiving 2021. (Item 2) \nIn his September 5, 2018, SCA he acknowledged that he had been smoking \nmarijuana about once a week for recreational use because it provides a good method of \nrelaxation. He specified the time was from March 1999 until August 2018. He admitted \nthat he was using marijuana while holding a security clearance, and that he intended to \nuse the marijuana in the future. (Item 3) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s January 2019 interview, he stated that he bought marijuana \nfrom friends. He noted that he is not dependent on the illegal use of marijuana and has \nnever tested positive for it..

Applicant stated that he would abstain from further drug use. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record, especially while holding a \nsecurity clearance is serious. He has not presented in a credible manner a case for \ngranting him a security clearance. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleged in SOR 2.a and 2.b that Applicant falsified material facts on his \nSeptember 2008 SCA by answering \u201cNO\u201d to the questions in Section 24 \u2013 Illegal Use of \nDrugs of Drug Activity as set forth in subparagraph 1.a of the SOR. It cross-alleged his \nmarijuana use in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nApplicant denied the falsification allegations because he believes he made a \nmistake and misinterpreted the question in assuming the other sections correlated. He \nclaimed he answered the question incorrectly by an honest mistake. He claims he was \nnot trying to hide anything or be deceptive, or lie. He has held a security clearance since \n2009. On his SCA, he answered \u201cNO.\u201d to have you ever illegally used or otherwise been \nillegally involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a security \nclearance other than previously listed? He did not add any information concerning this \nissue in his DOHA interrogatories. He insisted that he had no ill intentions because his \nwork position is strongly reliant on his clearance and he has been truthful in his \nrepresentation to the best of his ability. (Item 2)  \n` \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \n.Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted that \nthe illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npurpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. This is \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it \nraises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish that he used and purchased marijuana as alleged \nin the SOR for some years and while holding a security clearance. The record also \nestablishes that Applicant used illegal drugs after being employed with a Federal \ncontractor. Applicant\u2019s statement that he would continue to use it does not lend credibility \nto his one statement that he would abstain in the future. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana after \nhe knew that his position with a federal contactor required him to refrain from using illegal \ndrugs shows a reckless disregard for rules and regulations. This is sufficient to raise AG \n\u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse, AG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding \u2026 purchase or sale; AG \u00b6 25(f) expressed intent to continue drug involvement \nand substance misuse, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such \nmisuse. The Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, \nraises security concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \nApplicant\u2019s last use of marijuana, an illegal substance, took place in 2021. He has \njust recently stated that he would abstain from marijuana use because it is a tangible \nthreat to his security clearance. He believes his open and honest response to his \ninvestigator should prove that he is trustworthy. He argued that although he has been a \ndrug user since college and after, because he is finally forthright, the Government should \nignore the former illegal marijuana use because he made a mistake by not putting it on \nhis security clearance application in response to Section 23 . This does not mitigate his \ncase. This conduct casts doubt about his judgment and reliability. I find that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant falsified his SCA by deliberately failing to disclose \nhis use of illegal drugs in his 2018 SCA SOR 2.a and cross alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \n \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd.

ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nApplicant is a mature adult who has completed the adjudication process at least \ntwice during his career. He knew that the policy is against use of marijuana. His claim that \nhe just made a mistake or an error on his security clearance application is unsupported \nby corroborating evidence. I find that he intentionally falsified his applications and that he \ndid not report that he used marijuana while holding a security clearance. \nBased on all the evidence, I conclude that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nmaterial information in Section 24 of his 2008 SCA, by answering \u201cNO\u201d. He falsified his \ninformation in \u00b6 2.a. Thus, I also conclude for the reason listed above that the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(e) that his use of marijuana created a vulnerability as \ncontemplated by AG \u00b616(e), which applies to SOR 2.b.The following mitigating conditions \nare potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not attempt to correct the omission \nand stated he misinterpreted the question. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification is arguably infrequent, but it \nwas recent and did not happen under unique circumstances. It was not minor, because \nfalsification of a security clearance application \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security \nclearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole Person \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, and E in my \nwhole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s career as an employee of defense \ncontractors. I have also considered that he held a security clearance \nsince 2009. Because he requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor or to question him about the allegations \nin the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines  H, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns under  Guideline H and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H :  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAgainst APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nNoreen A.

(GE 1 at 26-27, GE 2 at 12-13; Answer; Tr. 41, 45-50,\n68-69, 76-79)  \n \n \n \n \nDuring a March 2021 interview with a government investigator, Applicant disclosed \nthat he smoked marijuana during visits to his birth state from 2017 or 2018 to October \n2020. He said that he thought it was okay to smoke marijuana there because it was legal \nunder state law. After being informed that federal law and DOD policy prohibiting \nmarijuana use applied to security clearance holders even if marijuana use was permitted \nunder state law, Applicant said that he would not use marijuana again. He said that he \nhad smoked marijuana two to three times each visit over a period of about two weeks. He \nsaid that he would take one small inhalation of marijuana from an electronic cigarette and \nwould feel more relaxed. He would sometimes consume marijuana edibles before going \nto bed. He purchased edibles in November 2019 for about $30. He said that he ate one \nor two of the edibles and left the remaining edibles with his best friend and his best friend\u2019s \nspouse. (GE 2 at 12-13) \nIn his June 2022 response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he ingested marijuana \n\u201conly 5-12 days\u201d during each annual visit to his birth state from about November 2017 to \nOctober 2020. (Answer) He said that he used marijuana primarily to help him sleep and \nwould \u201ceat a single 10 mg edible\u201d before bed. (Id.) He said that he was not \u201chigh\u201d from \nmarijuana at any time, was always in command of his faculties, did not disclose any \nsensitive information, never left his friends\u2019 house while under the influence of marijuana, \nand was never around anybody that he did not know or trust. (Id.) After learning that he \nwas not permitted to use marijuana in his birth state, he did not consume anything \ncontaining marijuana, and told his friends that he was prohibited from using marijuana. \nHis friends \u201crespected it and not only didn\u2019t offer [him] any, but even went outside anytime \nthey wanted to use [marijuana].\u201d (Id.) He said that he purchased a single pack of about \n15 marijuana edibles in November 2019. \u201cThe people I was with only smoked, and did \nnot take edibles, so I needed to purchase them myself. Any chocolates remaining once \nthe trip was over, I left up there.\u201d (Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant testified that he first used marijuana in about \nNovember 2017 \u201cjust on a whim [he] decided . . . I\u2019m hanging out with some friends, \nhaving trouble sleeping, here let me try.\u201d (Tr. 49, 68) He normally stayed with his best \nfriend and his best friend\u2019s spouse for seven to nine nights during each 12 to 13 day visit \nand spent the other nights with various family members. While staying in his friend\u2019s home \nand playing video games with them, he would \u201ctake maybe a single hit [of marijuana] from \none of the little vape pens\u201d once or twice per visit. (Tr. 48-49, 77) He said that he had \ndifficulty sleeping throughout the entirety of his visits so he consumed a single marijuana \nedible before going to bed every night except for the first and last night of his trip, including \nnights he stayed with family members. (Tr. 49, 78-79) He purchased edibles \u201cone time \nper visit . . .

(Tr. 47) Since learning that he was prohibited from using marijuana he has \nvisited and stayed with his best friend and his best friend\u2019s spouse. (AE D at 2) After he \ntold them that he was prohibited from using marijuana with a security clearance, \u201cthey \nwere very considerate and instead of using their vapes or whatever inside, they'd step \nout on the porch to use it, and [he] would of course if [he] was outside at that time, [he]'d \ngo back in just to avoid any secondhand issues.\u201d (Tr. 41) \nApplicant submitted a signed statement of his intent to abstain from drug \ninvolvement at the hearing. (AE B; Tr. 69) He also provided results from seven urinalyses \ndated from March 2021 to February 2023 that tested negative for illegal substances. (AE \nA; Tr. 70) He testified that the results were from unscheduled urinalyses that he was \nrequired to take every 3-6 months, as part of the process to refill a pain medication that \nhe had been prescribed for a shoulder injury since late 2020. (Tr. 70-71) \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe SOR alleges that, as of January 2021, Applicant had enrolled approximately \n$42,898 of debt into a debt resolution program and that the debt remained delinquent. In \nhis Answer, Applicant acknowledged incurring debts but said that he had resolved all \ndelinquent accounts. He attributed his financial problems to unanticipated expenses \nincluding replacement of home heating and air conditioning systems and a hot water \nheater, repair costs for flooding damage, fence repairs for damage caused by a fallen \ntree, and his pets\u2019 health issues. \nApplicant disclosed his financial difficulties and that he was working with a debt \nconsolidation company (DCC) in his 2020 SCA. He discussed specific details of each \ndebt and his debt resolution efforts during his background interview. He said that over a \nperiod of several years he had accrued delinquent debt because of unexpected \nexpenses. He was current on his debts but could only afford minimum payments on some \ndebts and continued to fall behind. \nIn about October 2019, he entered an agreement with a DCC to negotiate \nsettlements with some creditors and was told to stop making payments on those debts. \nBy March 2021, the DCC had resolved most delinquent debts with funds deposited \nmonthly ($584) by Applicant. In March 2021, he obtained a debt consolidation loan \n($24,413), and the DCC used the loan proceeds to resolve his remaining delinquent \ndebts. He has been current on all credit accounts since then and, as of May 26, 2023, \nhad reduced the debt consolidation loan balance to $12,363 by making required monthly \npayments. He said that he had made all required monthly payments on a home mortgage \nsince October 2016.

Each letter also noted that Applicant was unaware \nthat his use of marijuana in a state where marijuana use was legal was prohibited for \nDOD security clearance holders, that once he learned otherwise he abstained from using \nmarijuana and told them about the prohibition, and each recommended that he retain his \nsecurity clearance. His cohabitant, a Master Level Clinical Mental Health Counselor and \ncertified alcohol and drug counselor with six years of experience in addiction treatment, \noffered her personal but unofficial assessment that Applicant did not meet the criteria of \nsomeone suffering from any form of substance abuse or drug dependence, and that he \nhas not demonstrated symptoms of a substance misuse problem. (AE C-E) \nApplicant\u2019s regional service manager testified and authored documents that \ncommented favorably about his work performance, sobriety at work, reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and compliance with rules and regulations regarding safeguarding \nclassified information. He testified that Applicant had a security clearance and access to \nclassified information, and that he had communicated the issues with his security \nclearance renewal process including his marijuana use. (Tr. 28-39; AE G-H) \nAny derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for \ndisqualifying purposes; however, it may be considered in the application of mitigating \nconditions, assessment of credibility, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not inflexible \nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988); see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), any doubt \u201cwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any drug abuse; \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant admitted and other record evidence corroborated that he illegally used \nmarijuana from November 2017 until about October 2020, that he purchased marijuana \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin about November 2019, and that he used and purchased marijuana while granted \naccess to classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c) and 25(f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Two potentially \napply in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are not fully established. Applicant used marijuana 10-12 \ntimes a year from about November 2017 to October 2020, while visiting a state where its \nuse was lawful under state law. I find his corroborated claims that he has not illegally used \ncontrolled substances since October 2020 credible and he provided a signed statement \nof intent to abstain from illegal drug use. However, he used marijuana several years after \ncompleting an SCA that reflected DOD concerns about illegal drug usage, with knowledge \nthat it\u2019s use was prohibited under federal law and DoD policy, and while he had a security \nclearance and was granted access to classified information. He first used marijuana \u201con \na whim\u201d with his best friend and he then used marijuana more than 40 more times over a \nfour-year period including smoking marijuana with his best friend one to three times each \nof those four years. He provided varying accounts of the number of times he used \nmarijuana and purchased marijuana edibles. He continues to associate with and stay with \nhis best friend and his best friend\u2019s spouse, who continue to use marijuana while he stays \nwith them, albeit apparently outside of his presence. This evidence is insufficient to \nconvince me that recurrence is unlikely. \n\u201cAn applicant who uses [controlled substances] after having been placed on notice \nof its security significance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, \nmay be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd.

The circumstances of Applicant\u2019s use of controlled \nsubstances while holding a security clearance and granted access to classified \ninformation reflect poor judgment and raise questions as to his trustworthiness. I find \nApplicant\u2019s evidence insufficient to resolve concerns about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The record evidence \ndiscussed above including Applicant\u2019s admissions potentially support application of the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16. \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . any disruptive, violent, or \nother inappropriate behavior . . . . \nNeither AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) nor 16(d) apply because the evidence is \u201csufficient for an \nadverse determination\u201d under Guideline H. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including\nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified or sensitive information. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or \nsensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and record evidence establish two disqualifying conditions \nunder this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through 20(d) are established for the debts alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation was damaged by circumstances partially or fully beyond his \ncontrol. He acted responsibly by prioritizing and paying some of his debts, enrolling the \nremaining debts in a payment plan, obtaining a debt consolidation loan, timely making all \nrequired payments, and resolving all delinquent accounts before the SOR was issued. He \nhas taken reasonable actions under his unique financial circumstances to address his \ndelinquent debts and has established a \u201cmeaningful track record of debt reduction.\u201d See \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). There are clear indications that \nhis financial problems are resolved and are under control. His debts were incurred under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely and his financial conduct does not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.   \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, E, and F in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s \nage and maturity, work record, security clearance history, character evidence, and that \nhe has not used marijuana since October 2020. I also considered his history of illegal \ndrug use while granted access to classified information and his continued association with \nfriends in an environment where marijuana is used, albeit outside of his immediate \npresence. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means \nthat the record discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

At the hearing, I considered Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony, together with four Government Exhibits (GE), marked and incorporated into \nthe record as GE 1 through GE 4, and three Applicant Exhibits (AE), marked and \nincorporated into the record as AE A through AE C. Also, I took administrative notice of a \ndiscovery letter mailed from department counsel to Applicant, dated, June 22, 2022, \nidentifying it as Hearing Exhibit I. At Applicant\u2019s request, I enlarged the record through \nJune 9, 2023 to afford him the opportunity to submit additional exhibits. Within the time \nallotted, he submitted one additional exhibit, marked and incorporated into the record as \nAE D. The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 29-year-old married man with one child, age six. He is a veteran of \nthe U.S. Navy, serving from 2013 to 2017. HIs discharge was honorable. He is a high \nschool graduate and has earned some college credits. (Tr. 14) He works for a defense \ncontractor as an electrician. (Tr. 14) \nOver the years, Applicant incurred eight delinquent debts, as alleged in the SOR, \ntotaling approximately $26,000. They include three car loans, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a, b, and g, two personal loans, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.c and \n1.d., a credit card balance, as alleged in subparagraph 1.e, an outstanding municipal fine, \ntotaling $87, as alleged in subparagraph 1.f, and a line of credit, as alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.h. (Tr. 15-17) Applicant attributes his financial problems to youth and \nstupidity. (Tr. 15) He \u201cwanted everything,\u201d and \u201c[threw] caution to the wind\u201d to obtain it. \n(Tr. 15) \nApplicant purchased his first car in 2014. (Tr. 20) He financed it with the loan \nalleged in subparagraph 1.a. After the car began repeatedly breaking down, he voluntarily \nsurrendered it. (Tr. 20) He was unaware that he remained responsible for the loan after \nthe return of the car. Applicant purchased another car, financed with the loan alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b. After he \u201cgot bored with\u201d the car, he returned it to the dealer. (Tr. 16) \nApplicant then purchased another car financed through the loan set forth in subparagraph \n1.g. After this car began experiencing mechanical problems, he \u201clet [it] go to collections.\u201d \n(Tr. 18)  \nIn May 2023, Applicant contacted the creditor of the debts alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b, and negotiated a payment plan. Under the plan, Applicant \nwill pay the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a with 116 monthly payments of $50, and he \nwill pay the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b in 107 monthly payments of $50. (AE D at \n1 and 2) He has not made arrangements to pay the delinquent car note alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.g yet because he cannot afford to begin paying it until he satisfies the \nother car notes. (Tr. 28) \nApplicant used the personal loan alleged in subparagraph 1.c to cover the flight \ncost he paid to attend his grandmother\u2019s funeral.

(Tr. 26) \nIn May 2023, Applicant reached out to the creditor of the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.d and arranged a payment plan. Under the plan, he will satisfy it in 28 \nmonthly payments of $100. (AE D at 3) \nApplicant has been making $200 payments towards the satisfaction of the debt \nalleged in subparagraph 1.e, since October 2022. (Tr. 27; AE A at 3) He completed the \npayment plan approximately one week before the hearing. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant satisfied the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.f in May 2022. (Tr. 27; AE \nC) The balance on the line of credit alleged in subparagraph 1.h is $494, and the amount \npast due is allegedly $120. Applicant contacted a bank representative who looked up the \naccount and told him that he had a zero balance. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant has minimal monthly discretionary income. (Tr. 31-32) He intends to \nsatisfy his debt by \u201cslowly chipping away\u201d at it, satisfying one account in its entirety before \nmoving to another. (Tr. 33) In 2018, he consulted a financial counselor who rejected his \nrequest to work with him. Applicant has not attempted to retain a financial counselor since \nthen. (Tr. 29) Shortly before the hearing, Applicant\u2019s wife took a job. Previously she was \na stay-at-home mother. (Tr.21) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is still in the process of resolving his delinquent debts, and the majority \nremains outstanding. AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d does not apply. \nApplicant readily admits that his financial problems were caused by irresponsible \nmoney management. Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nApplicant has not retained a financial counselor. Nevertheless, he has satisfied the \ndebt alleged in subparagraphs 1.e, 1.f and 1.h, entirely, and arranged payment plans to \nsatisfy the debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b. Given his efforts to resolve or \narrange for the resolution of these debts, I am confident that he will resolve the remaining \nunpaid SOR debts, as promised, once he finishes satisfying the ones that he currently \nhas arranged to pay. Under these circumstances, both the second prong of AG \u00b6 20(c), \n\u201c. . . there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d \nand AG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply. In sum, I conclude that Applicant \nhas mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were the result of reckless overspending. As such, \nthe nature and seriousness of the problem was significant. Conversely, Applicant was \nadmittedly young and immature when he made these bad spending decisions. His \nrecognition of his financial problem, the steps taken to address the problem, and the \nprogress he has made thus far, lead me to conclude that he has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

She managed to pay her auto payments and insurance, \nbecause she needed her car for transportation to and from work. At that time, her gross \nmonthly income was $5,083 and a net after deductions of $3,032. After her routine \nhousehold expenses, that left her with a monthly net remainder of negative $121. (Items \n4 and 5.) The majority of her accounts became delinquent between 2016 and 2017, or \nlater. (Items 11 and 12.) \nApplicant\u2019s August 16, 2022 Response to the FORM stated that she is in a much \nbetter position financially than at the time of her PSI. Since her PSI, she received a raise \nthat made her annual salary $57,833, up from $45,000. She also obtained a court order \ndirecting her child\u2019s father to pay $1,000 per month in child support, which he has been \nconsistently paying. Included in her monthly budget is $729 she pays to a debt relief \nagency to settle or resolve ten of her SOR debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.i & 1k.)

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, the Court Case Summaries, and the Government\u2019s credit reports \nshow that AG \u00b6\u00b619(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a)  \nthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b)  \nthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) \nthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors.     \nThe question is whether any mitigating conditions apply on these facts. Many of \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts became delinquent in 2016, 2017, or later. That is not very long \nago. Nor were those SOR debts infrequent. And they persist to the present. Because of \nthe frequency and recency of the debts, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not mitigate her debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) requires a two-step analysis. First, the conditions \nthat caused Applicant\u2019s \u201cfinancial problem\u201d must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d her control. \nIn 2012 or 2013, her employer moved her to a different contract. As a result, her annual \npay was reduced by 30%. That alone would have had an unexpected and significant \nnegative impact on her finances. In 2014, she had surgery that resulted in expenses not \nfully covered by her insurance. No doubt that too aggravated her financial problems. And \nin 2015, she gave birth to her first child. Those circumstances were without question \nbeyond her control, and individually even one of those circumstances could have \nadversely affected her financial condition. To make matters worse, in 2021 the father of \nher child stopped paying his $1,000 of child support. The first question under AG \u00b6 20(b) \nis answered in her favor. \nThat brings up the second question under AG \u00b6 20(b). Did Applicant act \nresponsibly when facing that array of adverse circumstances? At the outset, she and her \nchild began living with her parents. She used her tax refunds to repay loans she had taken \nfrom her parents. She considered filing for bankruptcy but lacked the funds to pay the \nfiling fee. Instead, she enrolled ten of her largest debts in a debt relief agency. She pays \n$729 per month to that agency towards paying off those debts, all of which are listed in \nthe SOR. And she obtained a court order directing the father of her child to resume paying \nhis $1,000 per month child support. Not only is the foregoing conduct responsible under \nAG \u00b6 20(b), it also satisfies mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d). She has initiated and is \nadhering to a good-faith effort to repay her overdue creditors. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are mitigated by AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and (d). Moreover, the \nunresolved SOR debts of $8,428 are not of a sufficient value to raise national security \nconcerns. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  See AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis, I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light \nof all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. More specifically, Applicant \nproduced documents showing that she was current with her utilities, phone, and Internet \nbills. Those were not alleged in the SOR. Conduct not alleged in a SOR may be \nconsidered for limited purposes, one of which is to assess mitigating circumstances. See \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Applicant volunteered that \ninformation, and it works in her favor.   \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about her eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n     \n \n \n         \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.t.:  \n  FOR APPLICANT \n For Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to be eligible for access to classified \ninformation.

He has never been married and has no children. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. Since 2021 he has worked overseas as a civil \nengineer and functional manager for a government contractor. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1) \nApplicant was born in Iraq and lived there until he was about 30 years old. After \ncompleting college in Iraq in 2005, he worked for an Iraqi company in the construction \nindustry.

(Answer) \nIraq \nIn AN 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State \nas of September 2022, about the United States\u2019 relations with Iraq and the current \nconditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts:  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, \u201cLevel 4: \nDo not travel\u201d location due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and limited \nability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence \nand kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces \nand civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies \nthroughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas \nof the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently. \nThese events can develop quickly without prior notification, often interrupting traffic, \ntransportation, and other services; such events have the potential to turn violent. The \ntravel warning as of the date of this decision remains the same. \nThe country experienced large-scale protests in Baghdad and several Shia\u00ad\nmajority provinces beginning in 2019 and lasting through mid-2020, with reports of more \nthan 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. During the year sporadic protests \ncontinued amid a campaign of targeted violence against activists. The government took \nminimal steps to bring to justice those responsible for the violence. \nTerrorist groups and those inspired by such organizations are intent on attacking \nU.S. citizens abroad. Primary terrorist threats within Iraq included Islamic State in Iraq \nand Syria (ISIS) and Iran-aligned militia groups. ISIS is a designated terrorist \norganization, which is active in Syria and near the Iraq border. ISIS and its associated \nterrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent atrocities in Iraq despite \nimproved Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and criminal gangs target U.S. \ncitizens for attacks and hostage-taking.  \nThere have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, including: credible reports \nof unlawful or arbitrary killings; extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances by the \ngovernment; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the government; \nand arbitrary arrest and detention. \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or \nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers and foreign contacts are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The \nrisk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nA heightened security risk in Iraq is established by the administratively noticed \nfacts in the record. The security risks include the risk of terrorism and the human-rights \nrecords of this country. \nApplicant\u2019s mother and six siblings, with whom he maintains close and continuing \ncontact, are citizens and residents of Iraq, and four siblings have jobs that are connected \nto the Iraqi government. Applicant\u2019s longstanding connection to Iraq presents a conflict of \ninterest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, which Applicant denies, concerns a $200,000 property interest that \nApplicant allegedly holds in his family home in Iraq. The record evidence demonstrates \nthat the home is owned by his mother, and that his sister stands to inherit it. SOR \u00b6 1.h is \ntherefore found for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and   \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant has several immediate family members remaining in Iraq, with whom he \nmaintains close and frequent contact. Iraq remains a heightened risk country. Applicant \nfailed to provide sufficient evidence to find that it is unlikely that he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, \norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(a) does not apply. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that there is no conflict of \ninterest between his sense of loyalty or obligation to his foreign contacts, his allegiance \nand connection to Iraq is minimal, and that he has deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S. that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in the \nfavor of the U.S. interest. Even though Applicant earned a SIV to come to United States, \nhe has longstanding personal and familial connections to Iraq. He spent three quarters of \nhis life in Iraq, and after immigrating to the United States, he has spent a significant \namount of time living and working overseas, including in Iraq. Further, his ties to the U.S. \nare comparatively limited. He owns no real property here. He recalled few details about \nhis connections to the U.S. On balance, he did not provide sufficient evidence that AG \u00b6 \n8(b) should apply to mitigate the security concerns established by his family members in \nIraq. \nApplicant failed to provide sufficient evidence to find that his contact or \ncommunication with foreign citizens is so casual or infrequent that there is little likelihood \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation. In his SCA, he reported \nmaintaining frequent contact with most of his family members, and he continues to have \na close bond of affection and obligation for them. His temporary limitation of \ncommunications with his family members during the processing of his security clearance \ndoes not alleviate these concerns. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letters. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns under Guideline B arising from his foreign contacts and \nconnections to Iraq. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992, \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue eligibility \nfor Applicant\u2019s security clearance. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising \nunder Guideline F (financial considerations). \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn July 2022, Applicant provided a response to the SOR with attached \ndocumentation and requested a hearing.

On January 24, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na notice of hearing, setting the hearing for February 23, 2023, using the Microsoft Teams \nvideo teleconference system. Her hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine Government exhibits (GE) \n1-9; Applicant offered two exhibits which I labeled as Applicant exhibits (AE) A and \nB; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. I held the \nrecord open until March 9, 2023, in the event either party wanted to supplement the record \nwith additional documentation. On March 2, 2023, I received a copy of the hearing \ntranscript. (Tr.) On March 9, 2023, Applicant submitted five exhibits, (AE C through G); \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection; however, Department Counsel \nrequested four days in which to respond to the newly submitted documents. I granted the \nrequest. I received Department Counsel\u2019s response on March 13, 2023, marked as GE \n10, and the record closed. \n Evidentiary Matters \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel stated that the amounts for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j \nand 1.k were transposed, and she requested the SOR be amended to accurately reflect \nthe amount of debt owed to the specific creditor. I granted the motion without objection \nand amended the SOR accordingly. (Tr. 8-9) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2022 SOR response, she admitted all of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u00ad\n1.k.) and provided some clarification if the specific debt was considered a joint debt, or \nan account owned by her ex-husband. The SOR alleges 11 delinquent accounts with a \ncombined total of $134,323. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old, and she has been employed by different federal \ncontractors since June 2009. She began working for her current employer in September \n2018. She is an assistant program manager for a program called Education with Industry. \nShe earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002 in government and international politics. She \nwas married in 1990, separated in 2016, and divorced in May 2021. She has three adult \nchildren. She has recently remarried. Her annual salary is approximately $83,000, and \nher husband\u2019s net monthly income is about $3,000. (Tr. 27-28, 59; GE 1; AE A) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant testified that beginning in 2015, she and her spouse began to experience \nfinancial problems. At that time, her first husband was unemployed and a severe \nalcoholic. When he was employed, his salary was substantially higher than her annual \nincome of about $60,000. When he was unemployed, she would have just enough money \nto support the family but not enough to pay all their bills. Over time, the bills accumulated, \nand they soon were faced with an overwhelming amount of delinquent debt. They \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nseparated in 2016 and their divorce was finalized in May 2021. She does not \ncommunicate with her ex-husband as their divorce was contentious. (Tr. 27-31, 35, 60-\n61) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a student loan referred for collection in the amount of $113,181. \nApplicant admitted that about 63% of this debt belongs to her, which would amount to \napproximately $68,000, and the remainder belongs to her ex-husband. In about 2005, \nthey consolidated their student loans which, at that time, totaled approximately $87,617. \nSince voluntary payments were not being sent to the creditor, the creditor garnished her \nwages. She provided a December 2019 pay stub that showed her 2019 wages had been \ninvoluntarily garnished in the total amount of about $5,498 for the year. An April 2020 pay \nstub reflected her wages were garnished in the total amount of $3,550 for the year, for a \ncombined total of $9,048. Thereafter the garnishment stopped, presumably due to \nPresident Biden\u2019s March 2020 order for an emergency pause on the payment of student \nloans. Under the CARES Act, Federal student loan payments remain paused until at least \nJune 30, 2023. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19 (Tr. 32-41; \nGE 2, GE 7; AE C) \nApplicant stated in response to interrogatories dated November 2021, that as soon \nas the federal pause on student loans is lifted, she will begin making payments. The \noutstanding student loan balance is $113,181. She did not provide supporting \ndocumentation to show that 63% of the student loan debt is her responsibility, or that she \nhad voluntarily made payments on her delinquent student loans before the CARES Act \nwas passed. (Tr. 32-41; GE 2, GE 7; AE C) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f allege five collection accounts with the same \ncreditor totaling $1,322. Applicant stated in her July 2022 SOR response that a payment \nplan was established with this creditor. Monthly payments of $100 would start on July 25, \n2022, through August 2023 to pay these accounts in full. On March 9, 2023, she provided \ndocumentation which showed the payment plan is in process with an outstanding balance \nof $522. These accounts are being resolved. (SOR response; Tr. 41-42; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a delinquent account with a retail store that was charged-off as \na bad debt in the amount of $1,947. Applicant stated in her July 2022 SOR response that \na payment plan was established with this creditor. Monthly payments of $25 would start \non July 25, 2022 and continue until the account was paid in full. During the hearing she \nstated she would submit supporting documentation while the record was held open. She \ntimely submitted information that showed the account payment plan was not in effect. The \npayments had stopped in 2022 due to incorrect bank information. The balance of the \naccount is $1,848. Applicant stated in an email that she requested monthly statements \nbe sent to her so she can start to make payments again. She did not provide supporting \ndocumentation. This account has not been resolved. (SOR response; Tr. 42; GE 3; E-\nmail dated March 9, 2023) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a delinquent account with a credit union that was referred for \ncollection in the amount of $492.

Applicant provided documentation \nwith her February 2022 SOR response that she had been making payments and the \ncombined total amount of these accounts was approximately $2,196. She also stated \nduring the hearing she would submit supporting documentation while the record was held \nopen.

(Tr. 43; SOR response and \nattachments; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a delinquent account with a credit card bank creditor that was \ncharged-off as a bad debt in the amount of $13,322. Applicant testified that it was a credit \ncard account that had been opened in her name that was used to buy household supplies \nafter she and her husband purchased a house. She testified that she would be able to \ngather more information about this account and would provide it while the record was held \nopen. She timely provided information in her email that the creditor bank has merged with \nanother bank, and that all past unpaid debts with the original bank had been charged-off. \nThe bank representative advised her to work with a credit counselor to have this account \nremoved from her credit bureau report. Applicant failed to provide supporting \ndocumentation. This account has not been resolved. (Tr. 43-45; GE 3; E-mail dated \nMarch 9, 2023) \nApplicant testified that she does not have a formal monthly budget and she has \nnot sought the assistance of a financial counseling program to resolve her indebtedness. \nShe completed a personal financial statement (PFS) in November 2021. The PFS showed \nthat after paying her monthly expenses, she had a net monthly remainder of about $2,700. \nThe PFS did not reflect any payment to her delinquent creditors. When she was asked \nduring the hearing why she was not paying on her delinquent accounts, Applicant stated \nthat she did not make payments on the unpaid accounts because she was waiting for her \ndivorce to be finalized.

(AE B, AE G) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

An individual who is financially\noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise\nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, as shown by her admissions \nand by credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nApplicant has a long history of incurring delinquent debts. One of her debts has \nbeen paid, and some others are being resolved through a payment agreement. However, \nthe bulk of Applicant\u2019s debts are unresolved, including her delinquent student loans. She \nhas not made an effort to address them, and payments made through an involuntary wage \ngarnishment does not receive full mitigation, such as a good-faith effort of initiating a \npayment plan with the creditor. Her student loans were delinquent long before the CARES \nAct was enacted in March 2020. She testified that she does not really have a monthly \nbudget in place, and she had not completed financial counseling. She has not established \nthat her financial behavior is unlikely to recur or no longer casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(c) do not apply. \nThere were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control which contributed to her financial \nproblems. Her spouse\u2019s unemployment, her underemployment, and a contentious \ndivorce. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nshe must provide evidence that she acted responsibly under the circumstances.

Her \ndivorced had already been finalized for six months at the time she filled out her PFS. \nIt is clear after reading Applicant\u2019s SOR response that she initiated two payment \nplans with creditors only after she received the SOR in July 2022. One of the payment \nplans was not executed, however, due to incorrect bank information. I find Applicant has \nnot acted responsibly under the circumstances. She did not provide a reasonable \nexplanation as to why she was unable to make better progress addressing her delinquent \naccounts when she had the financial resources at her disposal. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) \ndo not apply. Under all of these circumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial \nconsiderations security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 54 years old, and she is highly regarded as a committed and \nresponsible employee at her place of employment. I observed her demeanor during the \nhearing. There is no question in my mind that she is an exceptional employee providing \noutstanding service. \nApplicant did not establish why she was unable to make better progress in \nresolving her delinquent creditors. This is especially so after the review of her November \n2021 PFS showed she had a net monthly remainder of about $2,700, without any \npayments going to her delinquent creditors. She did not initiate good-faith payments plans \nwith some of her creditors until after she received the SOR in July 2022. Her actions \ndemonstrate a lack of fiscal responsibility and good judgment, and raise unmitigated \nquestions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of her past-due debt, she may well be \nable to demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person.

He also acknowledged that he was violating his employer\u2019s drug use policy \nwhen he used marijuana. He last used marijuana in March 2021. He has not used or \npurchased any other illegal drugs.

He claimed that he is now ashamed of the statements he made \nregarding marijuana use in his 2021 SF 86 and during his June 2021 security interview. \nHe credits the birth of his son and his overall maturation process with changing his \nperspective. He claimed that having a child, with another on the way, has led him to put \nhis family first, and to look out for their best interests, instead of his own. He also \nclaimed that he now understands that he must abide by the federal prohibition against \nmarijuana use regardless of whether he agrees with it. He volunteered his illegal drug \nuse in his 2017 SF 86 and his 2021 SF 86 and discussed it openly with the investigators \nduring his security interviews in August 2018 and June 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAny adverse information not alleged in the SOR cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application of \nmitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant illegally used and purchased marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout 2011 until about 2021. He also illegally used and purchased marijuana while he \nhad been granted access to classified information. In his 2021 SF 86, he stated that he \nwas open to using marijuana in the future. All the above-listed disqualifying conditions \nare applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant has not used or purchased illegal drugs for more than two years. While \nhis illegal drug use and purchase in 2019 and 2021 was exacerbated by his holding a \nsecurity clearance, I do not believe his drug misuse is likely to recur. I base my opinion \non his two years of abstinence and his credible testimony that he will not use illegal \ndrugs in the future. His candor in divulging derogatory information throughout the \nclearance process and his changed circumstances in starting a family fortify my opinion \nthat he will not use or purchase illegal drugs again. AG \u00b6 26(a) fully applies. While he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstill associates with the individuals with whom he previously used marijuana, there is no \nevidence that those associates continue to use it. He provided the signed statement of \nintent to abstain contemplated in AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). However, AG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially \napplicable because there is no evidence that he has changed or avoided the \nenvironment where drugs were used. Regardless, as I have found AG \u00b6 26(a) to be fully \napplicable and AG \u00b6 26(b) to be partially applicable, I find that the drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character-reference letters, his credible testimony, and his \nconsistent open and honest reporting of derogatory information. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the Guideline H security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

I am unable to make a \ncredibility assessment as Applicant elected not to have a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred over $38,000 in past-due indebtedness over the past \nseveral years, following the discharge of $89,235 in previous consumer debt through her \n2013 bankruptcy. She has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR, nor does she \nhave any current plans to do so. These facts establish prima facie support for the \nforegoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those \nconcerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nThe evidence does not establish that any of the above mitigating conditions apply \nto Applicant. She failed to submit sufficient evidence that would tend to support any of \nthem. There is some evidence that these debts may have been created during her \nmarriage, and that both she and her husband were unemployed at various times. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, there is little to no evidence that she has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She indicated in her e-QIP a desire to repay these debts. However, her \nAnswer indicated that she was waiting for these debts to fall off her credit report. Applicant \nis under the mistaken impression that the fact a debt is old means it no longer exists. In \nsecurity clearance cases such as this that explanation for non-payment is not one that \nshows good judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness on Applicant\u2019s part. There is no basis \nin the record evidence for me to find that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \narising from her financial situation. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not mitigated the \nconcerns over her considerable past-due indebtedness. The significant potential for \npressure, coercion, or duress remains undiminished. Overall, the record evidence creates \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.q: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old. He completed high school and then earned an associate \ndegree in 2016. He married in 2008 and has two children ages 11 and 12. He has a third \nchild from another relationship. The age of the child is unknown. Applicant served in the \nmilitary from 2007 until 2014. He received a discharge under other than honorable \nconditions. Applicant had two periods of unemployment. After his discharge he was \nunemployed for two months in 2014 and again from April 2017 to June 2017. He has \nworked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since May 2018. \nThe SOR alleges 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately $45,722. Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in his answer to the SOR, background interview, responses to government \ninterrogatories, and credit reports from November 2018, January 2021, September 2021, \nand February 2022, corroborate the SOR allegations. (GE 1-8) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2018. In it \nhe disclosed he had delinquent debts and stated he called some debt collectors that \nappeared on his credit report to try and make payment arrangements and determine the \nbalance he owed. He then explained he fell on hard times and could not make payments \non his largest debt that is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. His interrogatory response to his largest \ndebt was that it was not paid and no efforts had been made to make payment \narrangements. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant also explained that he had fathered a child while he was separated from \nhis wife and in the military. Two years later the mother of the child petitioned for child \nsupport. He explained he had been sending packages to the child every other month but \nthe court did not recognize this as child support but rather were gifts. SOR \u00b6 1.d ($4,884) \nis the amount alleged in arrears. His February 2022 credit report shows a balance of \n$3,067. Applicant did not respond to questions in his interrogatories about the status of \nhis delinquent child support or provide any current documentation to support he has made \nsubsequent efforts to pay the arrearages. (Items 2-8) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s February 2019 background investigation interview, he \nacknowledged almost all of the debts. He explained he was in the process of resolving \nthem. He said he was working with a credit repair company to help resolve his delinquent \ndebts. In his response to interrogatories, Applicant provided documents that he resolved \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q.

He did not provide any \nother evidence or documents that he has resolved any of the remaining debts in the SOR, \nhas payment plans, contacted any of the creditors, or disputed any debts. (GE 4) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had 17 delinquent debts that he has been aware of since at least 2018 \nthat he was unable to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to that debt. He had \ntwo short periods of unemployment after his military discharge and was underemployed \nfor a period. These conditions were beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has been \nworking steadily for a federal contractor since May 2018. He did not provide evidence of \nany payments he may have made towards his remaining 16 debts that total more than \n$45,000. He stated he signed up for help from a credit repair company but did not provide \nany evidence of action taken to resolve any of the debts. No evidence was provided that \nsupports he has a payment plan with the any of the creditors, or that he has taken any \nother responsible action to resolve his delinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication .AG \u00b6 20(c) also has minimal application because he has not offered any proof \nof financial counseling, and there are not clear indications that his financial problems are \nbeing resolved or under control. No other mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph     1.q: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

As a result of this misconduct, on June 16, 2020, Applicant was \nterminated from his place of employment, and thereby removed from Federal service. \n(GXs 6~9.) \nMost recently, in September of 2022, a Doctor of Psychology determined \nApplicant to be suffering from \u201ccompulsive behavior,\u201d but not from a \u201ccompulsive \ndisorder.\u201d She also averred, in part, the following: \u201cI feel his lapse in judgment was the \nproduct of severe and atypical psychosocial stressors the specific nature of which he is \nunlikely to again experience.\u201d The Doctor further averred: \u201cthe preponderance of the \nevidence in this case suggests that . . . [Applicant] is a reliable, ethical, and trustworthy \nemployee.\u201d (AppX M.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline M - Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Use of Information Technology \nis set out in AG \u00b6 39: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology [IT] systems may raise security \nconcerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into \nquestion the willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, \nnetworks, and information. Information Technology includes any \ncomputer-based, mobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, \nprocess, manipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any \ncomponent, whether integrated into a larger system or not, such as \nhardware, software, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these \noperations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 40. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \nApplicant, despite being previously suspended for such conduct, he continued to \ndownload unauthorized pornography on his Government computer. \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \nd) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \nNone of these apply. Despite a repeated warning; and a suspension, Applicant \ncontinued his unauthorized IT misconduct. Use of Information Technology is found \nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior\nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant received sexual gratification from downloading pornography on to a \nGovernment computer on numerous occasions until at least April of 2020. His conduct \nrepresents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior that reflects a lack of discretion or \njudgment. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 including: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThere is clear evidence from a Doctor of Psychology that future instances of this \nnature are unlikely to occur. (AppX M.) Sexual Behavior is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant continued to misuse his Government computer after being suspended \nand advised that any such future misconduct could result in severe disciplinary action. \nAs a result, he was removed from Federal service. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nNone of these apply. In light of Applicant\u2019s fairly recent 2020 removal from \nFederal serve as the result of his repeated failure to comply with rules and regulations, \nPersonal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines M, D, and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nInformation Technology and Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on June 5, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with character references. For good \ncause shown, Applicant was granted seven calendar days to supplement the record with \na written budget. Department Counsel was afforded two days to respond. Within the \ntime permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with character references and a brief \nbudget. Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted as AEs C-D. \nPrior to closing the record, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to \nchange the reported amount owing to SOR creditor \u00b6 1.c from $16,309 to $10,455 to \nconform to the evidence. The motion was granted without objection. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly accumulated two delinquent \nstudent loan debts exceeding $36,000 and five delinquent consumer and medical debts \nexceeding $24,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved and remain \noutstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged SOR debts that \nwere either charged off or in collection and added explanations and clarifications. He \nclaimed he had worked with a debt consolidation service that did nothing for him but \nallow his debts to become delinquent. He claimed he was involved in an accident where \nhe was fault free but was unable to obtain reimbursement of his medical bills from the \nother driver\u2019s insurance carrier. He claimed that he either has or will be making payment \narrangements with his other listed creditors. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GEs 2-\n3; Tr, 63-64) \nCredit reports confirm that in August 2017 Applicant took out a 36-month parent \nstudent loan for his son\u2019s college education in the amount $17,760. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 56-56, \n63-64) He took out this parent loan in his own name without any co-signature from his \nson. Since 2017, he has not made any payments on this parent loan, and credit reports \nconfirm that the account is in collection status with $20,627 owing on the cumulative \nbalance as of May 2022. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 42) \nCurrently, both of Applicant\u2019s student loans are in pause status. (Tr. 58-59) And, \nwhile the loans have been in pause status, Applicant has been exempt from making \npayments on either loan. (Tr. 58-59), However, the pause does not change the \ndelinquent condition of the loans, but only suspends any payment enforcement while \nthe pause remains in effect. And, despite promises to do so, Applicant has not provided \nany documentation of a payment plan or budget as to how he will rehabilitate his loans \nonce the pause is lifted. (Tr. 45) \nBesides his student loan debts, Applicant is indebted to five consumer creditors \nfor delinquent accounts exceeding $24,000. (GEs 2-3) He accrued these debt \ndelinquencies between 2013 and 2018. (GEs 2-3) Applicant attributed his debt \ndelinquencies to recurrent medical bills associated with a serious car accident he \nexperienced in 2015. (Tr. 42-43) \nEstimated medical expenses associated with his accident exceeded $100,000.\n(Tr. 44) Most of the bills (70 to 80 per cent) were covered by his medical insurance. (Tr. \n44) Applicant\u2019s incurred hospital co-pays and other medical bills he accrued to address \nhis injuries from he accident exceeded $22,000. (AE F; Tr. 42-44) \n \nIn 2018, Applicant retained a debt consolidation agency for about a year to help \nhim resolve his debts, (Tr. 48) Making no discernible progress with this agency, he \nterminated their services and withdrew his escrowed funds of approximately $5,000. (Tr. \n48-49) With the returned funds, he paid off some small medical bills. (Tr. 48-49) Except \nfor his payoff of his SOR \u00b6 1.f debt ($1,960), he has not addressed any of his remaining \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndelinquent consumer accounts and medical debt with the current resources available to \nhim.

Broken down, Applicant nets around \n$8,000 monthly in take home pay. (Tr. 38-39 49-51) His monthly expenses generally run \nclose to $5,000 (inclusive of medical expenses). (Tr. 51-52) His 401(k) retirement fund \ncurrently has about $100 in the account. (Tr. 40) Because his wife does not work, he \nhas only his own financial resources to cover his bills and other expenses. (Tr. 40) \nAfter accounting for his monthly expenses (inclusive of his medical co-pays that \nrun between $200 and $300 for himself and $200 for his wife), Applicant retains a \nmonthly remainder of close to $3,000. (AE F; Tr. 40, 53-55) Committing to taking care of \nhis bills, he documented a very limited payment plan and budget to support his ability to \ndo so.

(AE D; Tr. 21) \nWhile unfamiliar with all of Applicant\u2019s debts, she knew most of the details of his medical \nbills and how they affected his ability to address his other debts.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence.

AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in\nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of seven \ndelinquent debts (inclusive of two delinquent student loans, four consumer accounts, \nand one medical debt) exceeding $60,000 in the aggregate. These collective debt \ndelinquencies warrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial considerations guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \n\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to the specific facts of \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts with explanations require no independent \nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \n\u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies is critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited explanations for his debt delinquencies (primarily due to \nprioritized medical debts) are insufficient to warrant the application of any of the \npotentially available mitigating conditions. Enforcement suspension of Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent student loan debts (by far his largest delinquent accounts) does not mitigate \nthe pre-suspension delinquent status of his loans, and he made no documented efforts \nto rehabilitate his loans before the enforcement pause went into effect in 2020. \nCurrently, Applicant has no well-developed financial plan or refined budget in \nplace to aid him in mitigating the Government\u2019s financial concerns over his delinquent \nstudent loans. And, with the exception of the consumer debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.f \n(which he has resolved), he has made no concerted efforts to resolve any of his \ndelinquent consumer and medical debts with the ample resources available to him over \nthe past three years. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and \nhis explanations as to why he has not been able to address his delinquent student loan \nand other debts to date, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable him to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n                                         \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nmaintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding a \nsecurity clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted with explanation SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b, and he denied SOR \u00b6 2.a. I have construed Applicant\u2019s response to SOR \u00b6 2.b as a denial of that allegation. He is 35 years old. He married in 2009, divorced in 2018, and remarried in 2019. He has a minor child. He graduated from high school in 2006 and received a professional degree from a vocational school in 2008. (Tr. at 7, 21-22; GE 1-2) Applicant served in the National Guard from July 2011 to July 2017, and he received a general discharge under honorable conditions. He has worked for various DOD contractors since 2016. He worked for a DOD contractor on a U.S. military base overseas from January 2016 to September 2019, when he was terminated for cause, as further discussed below. He was unemployed from October 2019 to January 2020. As of the date of the hearing, he has worked for his current employer since October 2022.

At his request, I kept the record open until July \n5, 2023, for him to provide documents. He did not do so, and the record closed. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 30, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted with explanation SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.b, and he \ndenied SOR \u00b6 2.a. I have construed Applicant\u2019s response to SOR \u00b6 2.b as a denial of \nthat allegation. He is 35 years old. He married in 2009, divorced in 2018, and remarried \nin 2019. He has a minor child. He graduated from high school in 2006 and received a \nprofessional degree from a vocational school in 2008. (Tr. at 7, 21-22; GE 1-2) \nApplicant served in the National Guard from July 2011 to July 2017, and he \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions. He has worked for various \nDOD contractors since 2016. He worked for a DOD contractor on a U.S. military base \noverseas from January 2016 to September 2019, when he was terminated for cause, as \nfurther discussed below. He was unemployed from October 2019 to January 2020. As \nof the date of the hearing, he has worked for his current employer since October 2022. \nHe was first granted a security clearance in approximately 2011. (Tr. at 5, 7-8, 22-26, \n55; GE 1-2) \nApplicant was accused of sexual harassment for incidents that occurred in May \n2019, and he was barred from access to the job site and certain military installations \nindefinitely because of the substantiated allegations. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) A female soldier that \nhe met in May 2019 while working for the above-mentioned DOD contractor overseas \non a U.S. military base, whom he saw two or three days a week through work and \nconsidered a friend, alleged the following three sexual harassment claims: (1) when he \nsaw her at the post exchange, he walked up to her, ran his fingers through her hair, and \nasked if he could remove her hair bun; (2) he asked her what she had purchased from a \nwomen\u2019s lingerie, clothing, and beauty store; and (3) he walked up behind her while at \nwork, touched her shoulder, and started to give her a massage. (Tr. at 26-33; GE 2-4) \nApplicant denied these allegations. He acknowledged, in the third incident, only \nthat he walked up behind the soldier at work and touched her shoulder. He discussed \nthe sexual harassment allegations during his July 2020 background interview. He stated \nin his Answer: \nI admit that sexual harassment allegations were made against me and due \nto those allegations[,] I was barred [from] access to [military] installations. I \nwas never formally given any evidence regarding these allegations. This \nincident was not intended to be construed as sexual harassment and I has \n[sic] also denied that 2 of the all[e]gations happened as stated.

(Tr. at 26-33; GE 2) \n \nOn August 21, 2019, Applicant was placed on paid administrative leave. He was \nthen placed on unpaid administrative leave on September 21, 2019. This was the only \ntime he had ever been placed on administrative leave, and he did not view it as a \nsuspension. While on administrative leave, he stated that he was brought into the \ncaptain\u2019s office due to an investigation into the soldier\u2019s claims, and he provided a \nwritten statement in response to her allegations. He was unaware of what else was \ndone during the investigation. (Tr. at 26-35, 39-45, 48-56; GE 3-4) \nOn September 23, 2019, Applicant was terminated for cause due to sexual \nharassment, and he is not eligible for rehire. (SOR \u00b6 2.a; GE 3-4) He acknowledged \nreceipt of an October 2019 letter from the installation commanding officer, indefinitely\nbarring him access to the job site and certain military installations because of the\nsubstantiated sexual harassment allegations. An April 2020 email from his then-\nemployer\u2019s human resources director states: \n \n \n[Applicant] was accused of sexual harassment towards a soldier. A formal \ninvestigation was performed by the government, and the findings were \nthat [Applicant\u2019s] actions were in violation of Army Regulation 600-20, \nArmy Command Policy, para. 7-5 and Army Sexual Harassment/Assault \nResponse and Prevention (SHARP) Policy. It was also concerning that \n[Applicant] was in a building to which he did not have authorized access. \nThe final recommendation by the investigating officer was for [Applicant\u2019s] \nCamp . . . base access authorization to be revoked. (Tr. at 34, 39; GE 3-4) \nApplicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI was unaware of being terminated/fired and not \neligible for rehire as I was only told that I was released from contract. So therefore[,] I \ndeny knowing that I was terminated/fired prior to my video interview.\u201d He reiterated \nthese sentiments during his July 2020 background interview and at the hearing. He \nstated that no-one informed him that he was suspended, and he was only asked to turn \nhis DOD Common Access Card into his site lead. He was not required to formally out-\nprocess and return to the United States, and he was not barred from all installations \naround other command locations. He remained in country until early 2020, when he \nreturned to the United States to seek employment. (Tr. at 33-45, 48-56; GE 2, 4) \nWhen Applicant completed his February 2020 SCA, in response to \u201cSection 13A \n- Employment Activities,\u201d he listed his January 2016 to September 2019 employment \nwith the above-mentioned DOD contractor overseas, and he disclosed that he had been \n\u201c[r]eleased from contract\u201d by this employer in September 2019. He marked \u201cNo\u201d in \nresponse to two questions in this section and failed to disclose for this listed \nemployment that information as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) Those two \nquestions inquired: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReason for Leaving Question \nFor this employment have any of the following happened to you in the \nlast seven (7) years? \n\u2219 \nFired \n\u2219 \nQuit after being told you would be fired \n\u2219 \nLeft by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of \nmisconduct \n\u2219 \nLeft by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance for his listed employer . . .  \nReceived Discipline or Warning \nFor this employment, in the last seven (7) years have you received a \nwritten warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for \nmisconduct in the workplace, such as a violation of security policy? (GE 1) \nApplicant stated in his Answer, \u201cI admit to choosing No on this question due to \nnot knowing that I was fired from [this employment]. I was only told I was released from \ncontract. This was an honest mistake and was not intentional.\u201d He also maintained, \nduring his July 2020 background interview and at the hearing, that he did not view his \nplacement on administrative leave as a suspension. (Tr. at 33-47, 49-50; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant had no previous unfavorable incidents, and he has not had any \nunfavorable incidents since, to include with his current employer. He was not arrested or \ncharged with any offense. He expressed remorse for his actions and stated that he \nlearned his lesson. His spouse is aware of the allegations. (Tr. at 26, 34, 47-48) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual behavior: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nSexual harassment allegations stemming from incidents that occurred in \napproximately May 2019, between Applicant and a soldier that he met while working for \na DOD contractor overseas on a U.S. military base, were substantiated. \u00b6 13(d) applies. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14. I considered \nrelevant AG \u00b6 14(b), \u201cthe sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.\u201d This was an isolated \nincident that occurred over four years ago. Applicant was not arrested or charged with \nany offense. He was remorseful and learned his lesson. AG \u00b6 14(b) is established. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant was terminated from employment in approximately September 2019 \ndue to substantiated allegations of sexual harassment, and he is not eligible for rehire. \nAG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is established for SOR \u00b6 2.a. However, Applicant credibly testified that he \ndid not deliberately falsify his responses under section 13A of his 2020 SCA that \ninquired about his \u201cReason for Leaving . . .\u201d and whether he \u201cReceived Discipline or \nWarning.\u201d He disclosed his employment from January 2016 to September 2019 with the \nabove-mentioned DOD contractor overseas, and he disclosed that he had been \nreleased from contract by this employer in September 2019. He was never told he was \nfired, and he did not understand that his placement on administrative leave and his \nsubsequent release from the contract constituted a discipline or warning, despite being \ninformed that the sexual harassment allegations were substantiated and receiving \nnotice that he had been consequently barred from access to the job site and certain \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmilitary installations.

I considered \nrelevant AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment,\u201d and AG \u00b6 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\u201d Applicant\u2019s termination \nfrom employment in 2019 due to substantiated allegations of sexual harassment was an \nisolated incident that occurred over four years ago. Applicant had no previous \nunfavorable incidents, and he has not had any unfavorable incidents since, to include \nwith his current employer. He was not arrested or charged with any offense. He \nexpressed remorse for his actions and stated that he learned his lesson. His spouse is \naware of the allegations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) are established for SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis. The record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the sexual behavior and personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR also alleges five \nadditional delinquent debts totaling approximately $15,764.00 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.n). Applicant \nadmits the federal and state tax allegations, she admits SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n, and denies \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m. The record evidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations. \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant indicates she filed all of her federal tax \nreturns and that she is working with a tax firm/association to help her settle the tax debt \nthat is owed to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). They hope to arrange a monthly \npayment plan on her behalf that she can afford. They are also working on her state tax \nissues. She disputes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k and 1.m because she does not \nrecognize the debts. The $72 medical debt alleged in \u00b6 1.n is for a flu shot. Applicant was \nunder the impression she could receive the flu shot for free. She paid the bill and she now \ngets her flu shots from a local pharmacy which provides flu shots at no charge. (Answer \nto the SOR) \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l is a mortgage account that is past due in the amount \nof $7,083, with a total balance of $158,617. Applicant admits that is for her home. Her \nhome has serious issues that need to be repaired related to a leaking roof. She needs to \nrefinance her mortgage to pay for the repairs. She claims the previous owner made some \nquick fixes in order to pass the home inspection. (Answer to SOR) \nIn February 2022, Applicant encountered severe health issues. She was off work \nfor six months. She appreciates the opportunity to explain her situation. She also is \nseeking budget counseling from a nonprofit organization in order to help her with a debt \nmanagement plan. She would have sought counseling earlier, but her health issues put \na hold on everything. Applicant states she is a good worker and has never sold out her \ncountry. She would like to get her budget and tax issues in order.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Applicant failed to file her state and federal income \ntax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. She owes the IRS an approximate \ntotal of $48,580 in unpaid taxes for these tax years. She has several other delinquent \ndebts to include a past due mortgage account, and two consumer accounts. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20.a does not apply because most of her debts remain unresolved. AG \u00b6 \n20.b partially applies. Applicant\u2019s significant health issues in 2022 were beyond her \ncontrol. This mitigating condition is given less weight because most of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial issues arose well before 2022.

While Applicant \nintends to resolve her debts, she has not demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20.e: does not apply. Applicant disputes the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and \n1.m, but provided no documents indicating that she submitted a formal dispute nor the \noutcome of a dispute for either debt. \nAG \u00b6 20.f applies with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.g because Applicant\nfiled her federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 \u2013 2017. It does not apply with \nregard to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.f and 1.h because she still owes federal income taxes for tax \nyears 2014 \u2013 2017, a total balance of approximately $48,580. It does not apply to SOR \u00b6 \n1.i because Applicant has not filed her state income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2015, \n2016 and 2017.\n \n \nWhen tax issues are involved, an administrative judge is required to consider how \nlong an applicant waits to file his or her tax returns, whether the IRS generates the tax \nreturns, and how long the applicant waits after a tax debt arises to begin and complete \nmaking payments. The Appeal Board's emphasis on security concerns arising from tax \ncases is instructive. See ISCR Case No. 14-05794 at 7 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016) (reversing \ngrant of security clearance and stating, \"His delay in taking action to resolve his tax \ndeficiency for years and then taking action only after his security clearance was in \njeopardy undercuts a determination that Applicant has rehabilitated himself and does not \nreflect the voluntary compliance of rules and regulations expected of someone entrusted \nwith the nation's secrets.\"). \nThe guidelines encompass concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). A security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the \nprotection of national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the \nGovernment has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with complying with \nwell-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with such rules \nand systems is essential for protecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s recent serious health issues.

However, she filed her federal income tax returns in 2018 and 2019. She had \nover four years to arrange a payment plan with the IRS to pay her delinquent federal \ntaxes, but she took no action. Concerns under financial considerations remain. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s 20-year \nhistory as an employee of a defense contractor. I considered her recent significant health \nproblems. I find her unresolved tax debts and ongoing financial issues outweigh any \nevidence of mitigation in Applicant\u2019s case. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her financial delinquencies. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.k and 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.l and 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nErin C.

He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since July 2004. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes $37,604 in delinquent student loans (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.j) and three miscellaneous debts that total $241 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k though 1.m) He \nadmits he owes all of these debts, except SOR \u00b6 1.k ($127).

(Item 2) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in August 2021. In it, \nhe disclosed that he failed to file his 2019 federal income tax return. He stated it was \nbecause he was unable to obtain an income tax statement from the military through its \ncomputer system for his retirement pay so he could file accurately. He attempted to \ncontact the appropriate agency, but was unable to talk with a person or reset his \npassword. He requested a password be sent by mail, but had not received one. He also \ndisclosed his student loans were delinquent and he was working to resolve them. He said \nthat he had \u201cwithholdings from paycheck that have been suspended right now because \nof COVID.\u201d He indicated that the payments were made through garnishment. (Item 3) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in November 2021. He \nconfirmed to the investigator that he had not filed his 2019 or 2020 federal and state \nincome tax returns because he could not access the online system to retrieve the \ninformation he needed about his military pension. He said he continued to attempt to use \nthe telephone and online system unsuccessfully. He told the investigator he would \ncontinue to attempt to obtain the information he needed but did not know when it would \nbe successful. He believed he owed about $500 in federal income taxes for each tax year. \n(Item 4) \nApplicant told the government investigator that in 2011 after his divorce, he went \nfrom a dual income household to a single income.

In them, he \ndisclosed his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns were not filed. He \nreiterated that he was unable to file them because he was unable to obtain his income \ntax statement from the military and the telephone number he was given was to a general \nswitchboard, so he could not make an in-person appointment. He did not know if he owed \ntaxes for these tax years. He did not have an installment agreement with the IRS. (Item \n4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations that his student \nloans were delinquent. Some of his loans are through the Department of Education (DOE) \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e) and others are with a private creditor (\u00b6\u00b6 1.f through 1.j).

(Items 2, 4, 5, 6) \nApplicant told the investigator that in 2014, he was paying $500 a month on his \nstudent loans and in 2015 the creditor wanted $1,000, which he could not afford, but he \ncontinued to pay $500. In his personal financial statement, provided with his \ninterrogatories, he lists a monthly payment of $500 for his student loans. Applicant has \nnot provided any documentary proof as to the current status of the alleged student loans, \npast payments, or a payment agreement. Due to the pandemic, there is a moratorium on \nstudent loan payments. (Item 4) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he did not provide any updated information \nabout recent efforts to resolve his tax issues, status of student loans, or resolution of his \nother delinquent debts. He explained he is doing his best to overcome his financial \nproblems and does not believe it should have an impact on his eligibility to hold a security \nclearance. He has not had any security violations in the past. He said he would never \nknowingly disclose national security sensitive information. He does not live extravagantly \nand believes his years of military and government service should be considered. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as required. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans and other unpaid small consumer debts. \nHe failed to timely file his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has approximately $37,604 of delinquent student loans that are in \ncollection status. He also has some smaller debts that he did not provide any information \non his actions to resolve. These debts are ongoing and unpaid. Applicant failed to timely \nfile his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. He has not provided evidence \nof actions he has taken to file his delinquent tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2011 divorce and being \nresponsible for raising the children. This was a condition beyond his control. He attributed \nhis failure to file his tax returns to being unable to obtain his income tax statements for \nhis military pension. This was a condition beyond his control for a period. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant failed to provide evidence of his actions to resolve his \ndelinquent student loans or delinquent debts. It appears his wages were garnished to pay \nsome of his student loans. Applicant may have initially been unable to obtain income tax \ndocuments for his military pension due to computer issues that were beyond his control. \nHowever, his failure to actively pursue a resolution of this problem and allow it to continue \ninto another tax year does not constitute acting responsibly. He offered scant information \nabout what he is doing to resolve it. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nThere is some evidence that payments were being made on Applicant\u2019s student \nloans, but they were through garnishment. This is not a good-faith effort to repay his \ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. He has not offered any evidence as to his current \nefforts to resolve or create a payment plan to address his student loans or other debts. \nThere is no evidence he has received financial counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k. It is not on his March 2022 credit report. I find for \nhim on this allegation. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to SOR \u00b61.k. \nApplicant did not offer evidence of arrangements he made with the IRS or his state \ntax authority to file his delinquent tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. \nI have considered Applicant\u2019s military and government service. He failed to meet \nhis burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is unmarried and has no children. He has a \nBachelor\u2019s degree. He holds the position of Systems Engineer. He is seeking to obtain \na security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nengaged in conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant was born in Kabul, Afghanistan in 1995. He relocated to the United \nStates with his family in 2004. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. He \nobtained his Bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019. He began working for a defense contractor in \nSeptember 2020.  He has never held a security clearance before. (Tr. p. 21.) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application on August 12, 2020. \n(Government Exhibit 1.) In response to Section 18, concerning \u201cRelatives,\u201d Applicant \nfailed to disclose his brother, as required. Applicant testified that he did not want to be \nassociated with his brother and so he did not list him on the application. (Tr. p. 26.) \nWhen Applicant completed the application, this brother was incarcerated in prison for \nauto theft. At some point he was released and placed on parole. He violated parole, \nand was sent back to prison. (Tr. p. 29.) Applicant later revealed that he withheld this \ninformation from the Government because he believed that it would negatively reflect \nupon him. \nApplicant was interviewed by an OPM investigator on September 23, 2020. \nDuring the interview, Applicant stated that his parents were divorced, and he did not \nspeak with his father and that he did not know his father\u2019s address. (Government \nExhibit 2.) When confronted with conflicting information that he provided on his August \n12, 2020, security clearance application, Applicant admitted that he deliberately lied to \nthe investigator at the direction of his father. His father told him to say that he did not \nlive with the Applicant, and that Applicant did not know what his father did for a living. \n(Tr. p. 31.) Applicant testified that when he met with the investigator for this interview, \nhe was actually living with his father, mother, sister and younger brother.

(Tr. p. 37.) \nApplicant states that he realizes what he did was wrong and stupid, and he \nregrets his decisions. (Tr. p. 34-35.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant deliberately failed to list his incarcerated brother on his security \nclearance application. \nHe also lied to the investigator about the nature of his \nrelationship with his father. He led the investigator to believe that he knew very little if \nanything about his father. He told the investigator that he did not live with his father and \nthat he did not know what he did for a living. When, in actuality, Applicant lived with his \nfather at the time and knew very well what he did for a living. The evidence is sufficient \nto raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission or concealment was caused or \nsignificantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual specifically \nconcerning security processes.  Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and \ntruthfully.  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. A security clearance is a privilege and \nnot a right. To be found eligible, it must be clearly consistent with the national interests \nto grant or continue a security clearance. The decision must be made in accordance \nwith the DoD Directive and its guidelines. Based upon the information presented, \nApplicant has not been truthful to the Government on his security clearance application, \nand during a personal interview with the Government representative. His character and \nintegrity is highly questionable. \nHis conduct shows poor judgment, unreliability, \nimmaturity, and untrustworthiness, which prevents him from being eligible for access to \nclassified information. The Personal Conduct guideline is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He once again purchased \nmarijuana in pill form from state-approved stores and used it two to three times a week \nuntil approximately June 2021, when he stopped all marijuana use. Altogether Applicant \nused marijuana in pill or edible form about 50 times. Applicant has abstained from any \nmarijuana use since that time and evinced a credible intent not to use marijuana in the \nfuture. He has returned to using legal supplements as a sleep aid and finds them effective. \n(Tr. 18-22, 26-29, 49-51.) \nAs stated, Applicant received a security clearance in 2011. That clearance was \nactive during the time Applicant was using marijuana. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section \n25; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 43-45.) \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness, or \nunreliability. Applicant denied the single allegation under this paragraph because he felt \nit was too vague. \n2.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that the Applicant\u2019s drug use \nhistory, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \nMitigation \nApplicant is viewed as a solid performer by his employer. He has repeatedly \nreceived recognition for his job performance. Applicant is respected by his coworkers and \nsupervisors. (Applicant Exhibits B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and K; Tr. 33-36, 38-40.) \nApplicant has been singled out to be part of a special program by his employer. \nThis program is limited to a small percentage of people throughout the company. \n(Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 36-37.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana for several months from approximately mid-to-late 2017 \nto August 2018, and again from November 2020 to June 2021. During that period, he \nused marijuana in pill or other edible form about 50 times. Applicant purchased marijuana \nfrom state-approved stores. He was employed in the defense industry and held a security \nclearance during that entire period of time. All three of the stated disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Guidance.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states that have \nlegalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana (including State A) and sought to \u201cprovide \nclarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding the \nimportance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy, writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nApplicant used marijuana in pill form about 50 times over several years. He only \npurchased and used it in State A, where such purchase and use are legal under state \nlaw. When he lived in State B he abstained from purchase or use, since marijuana use \nwas illegal in that state. This conduct was in the past and he stated convincingly that it \nwill not be repeated. Applicant thoroughly understands the consequences of any future \ndrug use or exposure. Viewing his marijuana use in the context of the whole person, \nApplicant has mitigated the security significance of his past drug involvement. Paragraph \n1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs stated under Paragraph 1, above, Applicant\u2019s drug use is in the past, and he \nevinces a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future. He has mitigated any concern \nunder subparagraph 2.a. Accordingly, Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his drug \nuse. His forthright disclosures on his e-QIP, during an interview with an OPM investigator, \nand at his hearing minimized or eliminated the potential for pressure, coercion, or duress. \nContinuation or recurrence of similar conduct is unlikely. Overall, the record evidence \ndoes not create any doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

She earned a high school diploma in 2003 and has taken \ncommunity college courses without earning a degree. She has never married and has \nno children. (Items 3, 5, 8) \nBeginning in about 2001, Applicant had upwards of six knee surgeries to repair \nor replace menisci and her anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee.

From about May 2015 until about the middle of November 2015, a medical \ndoctor again prescribed her Tramadol for pain relief. She claimed that she continued to \nexperience pain in her left knee until a surgical repair of a portion of her artificial knee in \nabout September 2022. However, she has not used opioids since sometime in 2016. \n(Items 2-4; FORM Response) \nWhile Applicant claimed that she did not use opioids for pain management, she \nillegally used \u201cmedical\u201d marijuana edibles with varying frequency for pain management \nfrom about October 2020 to the present. She thought using medical marijuana was a \nbetter alternative to opioids for managing her pain. In April 2022, she obtained a \ncertification from a family nurse practitioner for the use of cannabis products in State A \nwhere she resides. She claimed she thought marijuana use was \u201clegal\u201d in State A until \nshe had her security interview in May 2021. Despite her understanding of marijuana\u2019s \nillegality, she continued to use it and obtained the certificate for the use of cannabis \nproducts after her security interview. She claimed that, on an unspecified date, she \nmade her current employer aware of her marijuana use and decided to stop using it. \nThere is no evidence in the record to corroborate this claim. Conversely, she has also \nclaimed that she will stop using marijuana once she obtains a clearance, which implies \nthat she continues to use it.

In February 2015, a \npharmacist suspected her prescription to be fraudulently obtained and called the police \nwhile Applicant was waiting to pick up her refill. A police officer confronted Applicant, \nand she admitted the prescription fraud. She was arrested and charged with five counts \nof prescription fraud, a class 6 felony. In May 2015, she entered into a plea agreement \nwhereby she pleaded guilty to all five felony counts. She was sentenced to two years of \nprobation, was ordered to attend drug counseling, had her driver\u2019s license suspended \nfor 30 months, and was ordered to pay fees. As part of her plea agreement, her guilty \nplea on the five felony counts was suspended for a year and all five were reduced to \nmisdemeanors when she completed the other requirements of her plea agreement on \nJune 15, 2017. It is unclear whether she has continued to attend drug counseling after \nJune 2017. (Items 2-5; FORM Response) \nFrom about 2007 until 2014, Applicant held a security clearance while she either \nworked as a contractor for a government agency or directly for the same government \nagency. In about December 2013, she failed to properly escort individuals in her \nworkspace for whom she was responsible, because she was using social media. Her \nsupervisor revoked her access to the information-technology (IT) system that allowed \nher to access social media at work. Applicant wanted to continue to access social media \nat work, so, in contravention of the government\u2019s rules for accessing its IT systems, she \nused another employee\u2019s (her mother\u2019s) access information to access the government \nIT system. Her mother told her that she should not use her mother\u2019s access information, \nbut Applicant thought it was not a big deal. In about July 2014, the government agency \nfor whom she worked determined that she was inappropriately accessing its IT system \nwith another individual\u2019s access information and gave her the option of resigning or \nbeing fired. She resigned. She lost her security clearance because of this conduct and \nblames her actions on a \u201csevere error in judgment.\u201d (Items 2-4; FORM Response) \nTo show her rehabilitation and worthiness to hold a security clearance, Applicant \ncites to the years that have passed without using opioids, engaging in criminal conduct, \nor engaging in workplace misconduct. She claimed that she has learned from her \nmistakes and now possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to \nhold a security clearance. She claimed that the level of trust that her current employer \nplaces in her is evidence of this change.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nApplicant illegally used the opioid Tramadol without a valid prescription from July \n2014 until February 2015. She illegally used marijuana with varying frequency beginning \nin October 2020, and she failed to provide sufficient evidence that she has stopped \nusing it. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \nApplicant has not met her burden of providing sufficient evidence to show that \nher illegal drug use has ceased. She failed to sufficiently establish a pattern of \nabstinence. AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b) do not apply. \nApplicant eventually illegally used Tramadol after legally using it for years for her \nchronic knee condition. Her use of Tramadol ceased in about 2016. While she had a \nprescription for marijuana beginning in April 2022 for pain relief for the same chronic \ninjury, marijuana use is illegal under federal law. She used marijuana for over a year \nprior to her prescription and has not provided sufficient evidence to show that her \nmarijuana use has ended. AG \u00b6 26(c) applies to her use of Tramadol but not to her use \nof marijuana and therefore partially applies. \nApplicant completed a court-ordered drug treatment program as part of her \nsentence for prescription drug fraud. However, she began illegally using marijuana after \nshe completed this program and has not presented evidence of a favorable prognosis \nby a qualified medical professional. AG \u00b6 26(d) does not apply. None of the mitigating \nfactors fully apply. The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are \nnot mitigated, except as indicated above regarding her use of Tramadol. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn February 2015, Applicant pleaded guilty to five counts of felony prescription \nfraud after she illegally obtained Tramadol prescriptions and dosages by posing as a \nregistered nurse. There is sufficient evidence of criminal conduct as she pleaded guilty \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto all five counts and admitted to the criminal conduct in her plea agreement. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nWhile Applicant last engaged in prescription fraud in early 2015, she engaged in \ncriminal conduct again by illegally using marijuana beginning in October 2020. The \nevidence is unclear whether she has stopped using marijuana. She claimed that she did \nnot realize that marijuana use is illegal under federal law, but she admitted she \ncontinued to use marijuana after she understood its illegality. As she engaged in \ncriminal activity beginning in October 2020, and continues to do so, she failed to show \nthat the criminal activity is unlikely to recur or that there is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation. None of the mitigating factors apply. The criminal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations.  \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; and \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nIn 2014, after having her authorization revoked, Applicant repeatedly accessed \nand made use of a government IT system using another individual\u2019s access information. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 41. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nIt has been about seven and one-half years since Applicant made unauthorized \naccess of an IT system. There is no bright-line rule for what amount of time without \nrecurrence constitutes \u201cso much time.\u201d While acknowledging the severity of the \nmisconduct, I find that almost 20 percent of Applicant\u2019s life without recurrence is \nsufficient to show that her prior misuse of information technology no longer casts doubt \non her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 41(a) applies. Applicant has \nmitigated the Guideline M security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H, J, and M in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude she did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse, and criminal conduct security \nconcerns. She mitigated the use of information technology security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 70 years old and married and has two step-children, one is deceased. He has a Master\u2019s degree. He is employed part-time by a defense contractor as a Business Financial Manager. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for three charged-off private student loan accounts totaling over $158,000. Applicant admits two of the debts, specifically 1.a., and 1.b., and denies responsibility for 1.b., and 1.c., explaining that 1.b., may have been paid by his grandson; but he is not sure, and 1.c., is not a debt, but the name of the loan servicing company for the debt listed in 1.a. Accordingly, Allegation 1.c., is found for the Applicant. Applicant\u2019s credit report dated October 5, 2021, and his enhanced summary interview dated October 13, 2021, confirm the indebtedness set forth in Allegations 1.a. and 1.b.

Applicant submitted a response to the FORM. This case was \ntransferred to the undersigned DOHA administrative judge on May 24, 2023. Items 1 \nthrough 5, will hereinafter be referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 70 years old and married and has two step-children, one is \ndeceased. \nHe has a Master\u2019s degree. \nHe is employed part-time by a defense \ncontractor as a Business Financial Manager. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for three charged-off private student \nloan accounts totaling over $158,000. Applicant admits two of the debts, specifically \n1.a., and 1.b., and denies responsibility for 1.b., and 1.c., explaining that 1.b., may have \nbeen paid by his grandson; but he is not sure, and 1.c., is not a debt, but the name of \nthe loan servicing company for the debt listed in 1.a. Accordingly, Allegation 1.c., is \nfound for the Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s credit report dated October 5, 2021, and his \nenhanced summary interview dated October 13, 2021, confirm the indebtedness set \nforth in Allegations 1.a. and 1.b. (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.) \nApplicant stated that he co-signed on two student loan accounts for the benefit of his \ngrandson about ten years ago. The first student loan Applicant co-signed for is set forth \nin 1.b. of the SOR. The second loan Applicant co-signed for is set forth in 1.a. of the \nSOR. Applicant\u2019s grandson failed to pay the student loan accounts when they became \ndue. Applicant stated that he made a few payments toward the loans before they were \ncharged off, and he has made no further payments since then. \nApplicant currently lives comfortably with his pension and active income. He \nwants his grandson to re-pay the student loans, however, he stated that he understands \nthat he is responsible to pay them if his grandson does not pay them. Applicant retired \nfrom working for a Federal Civil Service in December 2011. He remained retired from \nJanuary 2012 until May 2012. He re-entered the workforce as a part-time contract \nemployee in about May 2012. He has worked for his current employer since 2018. He \ncurrently holds a security clearance which he was granted in August 2011. Applicant is \nan avid international traveler in his free time. He has sufficient money to pay his \ngrandson\u2019s delinquent student loan debt. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n      \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $64,324. Applicant admitted that he co-signed on the loan with \nthis creditor. Applicant learned that the debt became delinquent in January 2017. \nApplicant stated that he made a few payments on the account until it was charged off. \nApplicant understands that as co-borrower on the loan, he is guaranteeing repayment of \nthe loan. In Applicant\u2019s June 13 response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he has just \nreceived a letter from the collection agency regarding the loan. On or about June 10, \n2022, Applicant wrote back to the creditor requesting specific information as to whether \nthey had standing regarding loan payment and settlement. Applicant stated that since \nthen, they have provided a partial but not complete response. There is no evidence in \nthe record to prove that Applicant\u2019s grandson has paid the debt. Applicant has not paid \noff the debt, despite his clear ability to pay it. The debt remains owing. \n1.b. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $36,796. Applicant admitted that he co-signed on the loan with \nthis creditor. \nApplicant learned that the debt became delinquent in June 2018. \nApplicant stated that he made a few payments on the account until it was charged off. \nApplicant understands that as co-borrower on the loan, he is guaranteeing repayment of \nthe loan. In Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he stated that in April 2022, a change \nwas noted on his credit report stating that the lender or creditor reported that the loan \nwas no longer in derogatory status, and in the remarks section stated that there was \n\u201cpayment after charge off/collection and settled for less than full balance\u201d. Applicant \nstated that he has tried to contact his grandson to find out if he has paid anything \ntowards the debt, but he has not been successful. There is no convincing evidence in \nthe record to prove that Applicant\u2019s grandson has paid the debt. Applicant has not paid \nthe debt, despite his clear ability to pay. The debt remains owing. \n1.c. Discussed above, the SOR stated that Applicant owed a delinquent debt to a \ncreditor for an account that was charged off in the approximate amount of $57,183. \nApplicant contends that this is the same debt owed to the creditor set forth in allegation \n1.a. There is no evidence to the contrary. It appears that this entity was the loan \nservicing company for the loan set forth in allegation 1.a. Accordingly, there is nothing \nowed to this entity, and this allegation is found for the Applicant. \nOverall, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence in total mitigation. He \nhas not made a good faith effort to address the delinquent student loan debts that he \nco-signed for, nor has he taken any meaningful step to resolve these delinquencies. He \nhas submitted no documentary evidence to show that he has established an acceptable \npayment arrangement or that he is complying with a payment arrangement. There is no \nmeaningful track record of repayment. \nHe stated that he understands that he is \nresponsible to pay the debts, but he continues to ignore his legal obligations as co-\nsignor to pay them. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to two creditors for delinquent student loan accounts \ntotaling in excess of $100,000 that have been charged off for many years.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant, as the co-signer on two student loans for his grandson has defaulted \non the two loans and has refused to pay them. He has failed to provide sufficient \nevidence in mitigation. \nThis shows poor judgment and unreliability. \nAccordingly, \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been as irresponsible as his grandson by failing to pay the student \nloan debts he co-signed for. Applicant knew that the loans were delinquent back in \n2017 and 2018 respectively. He also knew that as the co-signer on the loans, he was \nresponsible to pay them if his grandson defaulted. Many years have passed since the \nloans became delinquent and ultimately defaulted. Applicant now claims that one of the \nloans may have been paid-off or settled by his grandson, but he does not know that for \nsure. Applicant stated that has not confirmed this with the creditor, nor has he spoken \nto his grandson about the matter. Applicant does know that his grandson defaulted on \nthe loan several years ago, and that the creditor was looking to the Applicant, the co\u00ad\nsigner, for payment. Applicant made a few payments towards the debts until the loans \nwere charged off. He has made no payments since then, and it does not appear that he \nplans to resolve the debts. His actions or inactions show poor judgment, unreliability, \nand untrustworthiness. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in light of all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \n6 \nI \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since 1999. He earned a high school diploma in 1989. He was married from 2006 until February 2017, when he finalized his divorce. He served on active duty with the U.S. Marines from 1991 until 1994, when he received an honorable discharge. He resides with his girlfriend, to whom he is engaged to be married. He has two adult children. (Tr. 15-18, 27; GE 1) At all times relevant to this proceeding, marijuana purchase, possession, and use has been illegal under federal law. Federal laws regarding marijuana supersede any state laws that are inconsistent with it. Applicant was granted access to classified information at all times relevant hereto. (Tr. 17; GE 1, 2) In about February 2020, Applicant traveled about 45 miles from home to purchase marijuana from a dispensary in State A, where it was sold legally under state law. In February and March 2020, he used marijuana on weekend nights a total of about 16 times in order to help him sleep. He did not report his marijuana purchase, possession, or use to his employer or facility security officer (FSO) until he realized that he would likely be caught for this use. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s failure to report his marijuana purchase, possession, and use to his employer or FSO, cannot be used for disqualification purposes.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 18, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. Applicant responded to the SOR on April 13, 2022 \n(Answer), and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was \nassigned to me on October 25, 2022. \nThe hearing was convened as scheduled on November 30, 2022. I admitted \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 and Applicant Exhibits (AE) A and B in evidence \nwithout objection.

He earned a high school diploma in 1989. He was married from \n2006 until February 2017, when he finalized his divorce. He served on active duty with \nthe U.S. Marines from 1991 until 1994, when he received an honorable discharge. He \nresides with his girlfriend, to whom he is engaged to be married. He has two adult \nchildren. (Tr. 15-18, 27; GE 1) \nAt all times relevant to this proceeding, marijuana purchase, possession, and use \nhas been illegal under federal law. Federal laws regarding marijuana supersede any \nstate laws that are inconsistent with it. Applicant was granted access to classified \ninformation at all times relevant hereto. (Tr. 17; GE 1, 2) \nIn about February 2020, Applicant traveled about 45 miles from home to \npurchase marijuana from a dispensary in State A, where it was sold legally under state \nlaw. In February and March 2020, he used marijuana on weekend nights a total of about \n16 times in order to help him sleep. He did not report his marijuana purchase, \npossession, or use to his employer or facility security officer (FSO) until he realized that \nhe would likely be caught for this use. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, \nsuch as Applicant\u2019s failure to report his marijuana purchase, possession, and use to his \nemployer or FSO, cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered \nwhen assessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person \nanalysis. On March 24, 2020, he underwent a random drug test through his employer. \nPrior to the test, he told his employer that he did not believe that he would pass the drug \ntest because he had been using marijuana. He tested positive for marijuana after taking \nthis drug test. As a result of his marijuana use and positive drug test, his employer \ncreated an incident report in the Defense Information System for Security (DISS). (Tr. \n18-22, 34-35, 37; Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nWhile using marijuana, Applicant knew it was illegal to do so. Since 1999, he \nreceived annual training regarding his responsibilities as a security clearance holder \nwith respect to illegal drugs. He knew that using marijuana violated the conditions of \nholding his security clearance and the terms of his employment. He knew that he was \nsubject to random drug testing. Applicant has sleep apnea and other unspecified \nailments. He claimed he used marijuana despite knowing it was illegal and incompatible \nwith holding a security clearance, because he was desperate to get quality sleep. His \ngirlfriend recommended that he try m\n \narijuana for his sleeping problems. A doctor did not \nrecommend or prescribe him marijuana. He did try other prescription and non-\nprescription medications to help him sleep before resorting to marijuana. (Tr. 15-19, 31-\n34, 36; Answer) \nAs a result of his positive drug test, instead of terminating him, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer suspended him without pay until he completed a substance abuse program \n(SAP). On May 2, 2020, he completed an SAP. The SAP consisted of three group \nmeetings a week for 30 days. His employer also placed him on probation for 24 months. \nWhile he was on probation, he could not be promoted. His employer required him to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntake monthly drug tests for 38 months. His employer also had him enter into a \u201cLast \nChance Agreement\u201d whereby he acknowledged that any recurrence of inappropriate \nbehavior would result in his immediate termination of employment. After his initial \npositive drug test, all of his subsequent monthly drug tests have had negative results. \nAfter he completes 38 months of monthly drug tests, Applicant will be subject to random \ndrug tests. Applicant is no longer on probation. He was promoted at work once he \nbecame eligible. He claimed that he will never use marijuana again and that he is \n\u201cscared to death\u201d because of all the trouble it has caused him. (Tr. 22-24, 36-37; \nAnswer; GE 1, 2; AE A, B) \nFrom about January 2022 until he received the SOR in March 2022, Applicant \npurchased marijuana for his girlfriend on three separate occasions. He purchased the \nmarijuana at the same dispensary in State A from which he purchased marijuana for \nhimself in 2020. He claimed that he purchased the marijuana instead of his girlfriend as \nhe received a discount because he is a military veteran. He claimed he did not \nunderstand that purchasing marijuana is illegal. He thought that he was doing nothing \nwrong as long as he was not using marijuana. He claimed that his annual training, his \nSAP and his Last Chance Agreement did not inform him that purchasing marijuana was \ninappropriate or illegal. There is no documentary evidence in the record relating to this \ntraining, the SAP, or the Last Chance Agreement. He claimed that after he received the \nSOR, he realized that purchasing marijuana is illegal, so he stopped purchasing \nmarijuana and wants nothing more to do with it. (Tr. 24-35, 37) \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend has used marijuana recreationally for at least six years and \nplans to continue to use it. She has used it a couple of times per week. She has kept \nthe marijuana in the home she shares with Applicant, but has used it on the property \noutside the house. She has used it while Applicant is home. Applicant claimed that he \ndoes not monitor her use and \u201cjust stay(s) away from it.\u201d (Tr. 24-35) \nApplicant provided character reference letters from two co-workers who know \nhim \nnoting \nhis \nreliability, \nprofessionalism, \ntrustworthiness, \nstrong \ncharacter, \nselflessness, and good work ethic. They also note that he cares for his family and has \nalways provided for them. His employer awarded him a certificate of recognition in \nMarch 2022 for his significant contribution to a work project. (AE A, B) \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s purchase and use of marijuana \nin February and March 2020 while holding a security clearance. The SOR also alleged \nApplicant\u2019s March 2020 failed drug test and the resultant punishment from his employer. \nHe admitted the SOR allegations with additional comment.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant purchased marijuana in February 2020. He used marijuana \napproximately 16 times in February and March 2020 while granted access to classified \ninformaiton. He also tested positive for marijuana. Marijuana is a controlled substance \nand its purchase and use are illegal under federal law. He knew using marijuana was \nillegal and inconsistent with the terms of his employment and with holding a security \nclearance. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and\nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this\nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not\nlimited to: \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant repeatedly used marijuana despite knowing it violated the law, violated \nthe requirements of holding a security clearance, and violated his terms of employment. \nI also note the involuntary manner in which he was caught. While he stopped using \nmarijuana about two and one-half years ago, he purchased marijuana again several \ntimes in 2022, with the last purchase being about six months ago. His illegal drug \ninvolvement was therefore recent and frequent. While he claimed that he did not know \npurchasing marijuana was illegal, his willingness to involve himself with marijuana again \nafter suspension of employment, SAP training, and employment probation shows poor \njudgment and a lack of reliability. Mitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(a) does not apply. \nRegardless of the two and one-half year pattern of abstinence of marijuana use \nthat Applicant has established, he still resides and associates with his fianc\u00e9e who \nregularly uses marijuana and does not plan to stop. He also failed to provide a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse. \nMitigating factor AG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. \nApplicant completed an SAP without recurrence of abuse. He did not present \nevidence of a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. Mitigating \nfactor AG \u00b6 26(d) partially applies. \nNone of the drug involvement and substance misuse mitigating conditions are \nfully applicable. For the reasons stated herein, I have ongoing concerns about \nApplicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character references and his military service. I have incorporated \nmy comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBenjamin R. Dorsey \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s March 2022 SOR response, he admitted all of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.j) and provided some attached documentation. (AE A and B) The SOR alleges ten delinquent accounts, of which nine are delinquent federal student loans. The combined total of the ten delinquent debts was $40,036. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is 52 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. Since July 2020, he has been employed by a federal contractor. He married in November 1997. In 2015, Applicant and his wife adopted a boy with special needs from China. He is currently 10 years old. Applicant\u2019s annual salary is approximately $69,000, and his wife stays home taking care of their son. He has occasionally picked up extra income by delivering food to people for a food transportation service. (Tr. 14-15, 23, 32; GE 1) Financial Considerations Applicant testified that beginning in 2015, he and his spouse began to experience financial problems after traveling to China to adopt their son. He was underemployed at the time, with an annual income of about $40,000, and his wife, who had previously worked earning an annual income of about $40,000, stayed home to take care of their son.

On February 24, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \na notice of hearing, setting the hearing for March 8, 2023, using the Microsoft Teams \nvideo teleconference system. His hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered three Government exhibits (GE) \n1-3; Applicant offered two exhibits which I labeled as Applicant exhibits (AE) A and \nB; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. I held the \nrecord open until March 15, 2023, in the event either party wanted to supplement the \nrecord with additional documentation. On March 15, 2023, I received a copy of the hearing \ntranscript. (Tr.) On March 16, 2023, neither party had submitted supporting \ndocumentation and the record closed. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s March 2022 SOR response, he admitted all of the debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a-1.j) and provided some attached documentation. (AE A and B) The SOR alleges ten \ndelinquent accounts, of which nine are delinquent federal student loans. The combined \ntotal of the ten delinquent debts was $40,036. His admissions are accepted as findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 52 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. Since July \n2020, he has been employed by a federal contractor. He married in November 1997. In \n2015, Applicant and his wife adopted a boy with special needs from China. He is currently \n10 years old. Applicant\u2019s annual salary is approximately $69,000, and his wife stays home \ntaking care of their son. He has occasionally picked up extra income by delivering food to \npeople for a food transportation service. (Tr. 14-15, 23, 32; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant testified that beginning in 2015, he and his spouse began to experience \nfinancial problems after traveling to China to adopt their son. He was underemployed at \nthe time, with an annual income of about $40,000, and his wife, who had previously \nworked earning an annual income of about $40,000, stayed home to take care of their \nson. Although the church provided the couple financial grants to pay for their adoption \nexpenses, the loss of his wife\u2019s income caused them to experience financial hardship. \nThey accumulated several debts he was unable to pay. His son also required various \nmedical services, and these expenses were mostly out-of-pocket. Applicant has medical \ninsurance through his employer, but his contributions to the medical providers are still \nvery expensive. They do not receive any financial assistance from the state or federal \ngovernment for the care of their disabled son. (Tr. 16-17; 26-30) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted to a car loan creditor for an account \nreferred for collection in the amount of $10,465. Applicant testified at the hearing that after \nadopting his son, he was faced with the dilemma of either providing for his family or \nkeeping the car he purchased in 2012. He was financially unable to take care of his family \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand pay for his car too. He made the decision to have the care repossessed in 2015. The \ncar was resold, and the outstanding amount was the deficiency balance he owed the \ncreditor. He made an attempt to set up a payment plan, but the creditor told him that he \nhad to pay the amount in full. (Tr. 15-18) \nIn approximately 2020, Applicant started working with a consumer debt relief \nprogram to assist him in repaying his delinquent creditors. He was able to resolve several \nmedical bills, a utility bill, and two credit card accounts. His car loan creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nwas not included the program because he received notice of a class action lawsuit that \nwas filed in 2016 against the car loan creditor. In his March 2022 SOR response, he \nstated that this creditor would no longer seek to collect on this account and any reference \nof this account was removed from his credit report as a result of the lawsuit. He attached \na notice of the class action settlement. The paperwork disclosed that the creditor \u201cwill no \nlonger seek to collect a portion of any deficiency balance.\u201d It also stated that the creditor \nwill delete trade-line information from the three nationwide consumer reporting \ncompanies. This debt is no longer collectible. (SOR response; AE A; Tr. 19-20) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, through 1.j allege nine student loans referred to the Department of \nEducation (DoED) for collection in the total amount of $29,571. Applicant testified that his \nstudent loans were deferred after his May 2015 graduation, but after the deferment \nexpired, he was unable to make payments and his loans went into default. In his March \n2022 SOR response, he stated that he had applied to the DoED loan rehabilitation \nprogram. Once his loans were rehabilitated, he would have his loans consolidated. He \nprovided documentation from DoED dated March 18, 2022. The letter provided basic \ninformation about which loans would be eligible for consolidation, and if the applicant was \napproved, the new lender would take the loans out of default status. He also provided \ndocumentation dated March 18, 2022, of his monthly income and expenses, to determine \nwhether he was eligible for the student loan rehabilitation program. (Tr. 21-22; SOR \nresponse; AE B) \nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n(CARES Act) became law, providing for relief measures on DoED owned federal student \nloans through September 30, 2020. This student loan debt relief received several \nextensions. In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed \nthe DoED to place federal student loans in forbearance. The federal government \nrepeatedly extended the student loan payment pause. The pause includes the following \nrelief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and \nstopped collections on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/. (HE 2) On February 25, 2023, \nthe FSA website said: \nThe student loan payment pause is extended until the U.S. Department of \nEducation is permitted to implement the debt relief program or the litigation \nis resolved. Payments will restart 60 days later. If the debt relief program \nhas not been implemented and the litigation has not been resolved by June \n30, 2023 \u2014 payments will resume 60 days after that.

(HE 3) \nDuring the hearing Applicant stated he had been accepted into the loan \nrehabilitation program, but then he decided against it. He said due to the CARES Act \nonce again delaying loan payments, he decided to take advantage of not making any \npayments until July 2023. (Tr. 22- 23, 25) \nApplicant files all of his income tax returns timely and he does not owe any \ndelinquent taxes. He brings home a paycheck every two weeks in the amount of $915. \nHe estimated that his student loan payments would be around $220 a month. He is \ncurrently unable to pay that amount with his income. After his loans come out of \ndeferment, he stated he would be willing to work a second job in order to pay on his \nstudent loans. (Tr. 24, 30-37) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts, as shown by his admissions and by \ncredit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant has a history of incurring delinquent debts since 2015. To his credit, he \nworked with a consumer debt relief service in 2020 and paid off several delinquent \naccounts. He did not include the car loan creditor in that program because he was a \nclaimant in a class action lawsuit. Based on his documentation, this debt is no longer \ncollectible; however, the bulk of Applicant\u2019s debts remain unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s nine delinquent federal student loans total $29,571, and they are \ncurrently deferred under the CARES Act.

He recently received notice that he was accepted into the DoED rehabilitation \nprogram, but he chose not to rehabilitate his federal student loans. He testified that he is \nwilling to obtain a second job in order to pay his student loans once they come out of \ndeferment. This amounts to a promise to pay a debt in the future. A promise to pay a debt \nis not a substitute for a steady track record of payments or other financial responsible \naction. \nIn the context of his security eligibility, I find that Applicant did not act responsibly \nby failing to address his delinquent student loans earlier. It is clear from the SOR response \nthat he filled out the student loan consolidation and rehabilitation paperwork after he \nreceived the SOR. This does not demonstrate responsible or good-faith action since he \nonly completed the DoED forms after his access to classified information was at stake. \nI am unable to find that there were conditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control which \ncontributed to his financial problems. Applicant and his wife made a choice to adopt a \nyoung boy with special needs, and his wife voluntarily gave up her job to stay with their \nson. Although I greatly admire their kindhearted choices, in the context of a security \nclearance decision, these were not conditions beyond their control. Under all of these \ncircumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 52 years old. His wife stays at home and cares for their disabled son. \nHe does not currently earn enough income to repay his student loans when they become \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \ndue in July 2023. Applicant testified that he had his student loans deferred after his May \n2015 graduation, but after the deferment expired, he was unable to make payments and \nhis loans went into default. He has never made a payment on his student loans. \nApplicant did not provide documentation of communications with his student loan \ncreditor once his loans became delinquent. He could have made more of an effort to have \nthe loans consolidated, rehabilitated, placed into deferment, or loan forbearance before \nthe CARES Act was enacted. He only took measures to address his student loans after \nhis receipt of the SOR. His actions demonstrate a lack of fiscal responsibility and raise \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of his delinquent student loans, he may \nwell be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nand the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude \nthat financial consideration concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since August 2020. He married in 1980 but divorced in 1999. However, he has lived with his ex-wife as a co-habitant since 2000. He has an adult child and an adult stepchild. He earned an associate degree in 1988 and has also earned technical certifications. He served on active duty with the Army from 1975 until 1978 and on active duty with the Navy from 1980 until 1988. He earned an honorable discharge from both branches. (Tr. 26-31, 34; GE 1, 2) Applicant has a long and consistent history of failing to abide by established laws, rules, and regulations. In April 1975, he was driving while intoxicated. He was arrested and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). In November 1985, he was charged with resisting arrest. A court dismissed this charge. Despite being required to do so, he did not divulge the 1975 DUI arrest on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in July 2020. He did not volunteer the 1975 DUI arrest before the DOD investigator confronted him with it during his August 2020 security interview. (Tr. 30-40; Answer; GE 1-3) In July 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. A court convicted him of the lesser charge of reckless conduct.

(Tr. 26-31, 34; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant has a long and consistent history of failing to abide by established \nlaws, rules, and regulations. In April 1975, he was driving while intoxicated. He was \narrested and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). In November \n1985, he was charged with resisting arrest. A court dismissed this charge. Despite \nbeing required to do so, he did not divulge the 1975 DUI arrest on the Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in July 2020. He did not volunteer the \n1975 DUI arrest before the DOD investigator confronted him with it during his August \n2020 security interview. (Tr. 30-40; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn July 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with aggravated assault. A \ncourt convicted him of the lesser charge of reckless conduct. The court sentenced him \nto six months of probation. In December 1987, he was arrested and charged with \naggravated assault and resisting officer-evading arrest. The court convicted him of both \ncharges and sentenced him to 12 months of probation. Applicant claimed that the July \n1986 and December 1987 arrests listed on his FBI criminal history sheet are inaccurate. \nHe claimed that he was only arrested in July 1986, and that the charges listed from his \n1986 and 1987 arrests stem from the same incident. He claimed that, during the July \n1986 incident, he merely shut the door to his home not realizing that a police officer was \nright behind him. He claimed that someone called the police because he and his wife \nwere having an argument. He denied that he was arrested or that he committed a crime \nin December 1987. (Tr. 30-34, 40-43; Answer; GE 1-3) \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s claim of not being arrested in December 1987, during his \ncross-examination, he acknowledged that arrest. He claimed that he and his brother-in\u00ad\nlaw fought one another, the police arrested him for public intoxication, and then beat \nhim when he put his watch back on so he could see what time it was. Also, during his \ntestimony, he claimed that he could not remember these incidents because it was so \nlong ago. I find his explanations about these arrests to be inconsistent at best and \ndishonest at worst. (Tr. 30-34, 40-43; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn July 1996, Applicant was involved in a bar fight. He claimed that a person that \nhe was playing pool with became angry about the outcome of their game and started a \nfight. Applicant claimed that he hit his alleged assailant in self-defense. He hit him while \nholding a knife in his hand but claimed that he did not stab him. Applicant was arrested \nand charged with assault with a deadly weapon other than a firearm and exhibiting a \ndeadly weapon other than a firearm. A court found him guilty of these charges and \nsentenced him to 180 days in jail and 3 years of probation.

He did not volunteer this arrest before the DOD \ninvestigator confronted him with it during his August 2020 security interview. (Tr. 35-40, \n45-46; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn September 2014, Applicant was driving while intoxicated. Police arrested him \nand charged him with DUI. He claimed that police gave him a breathalyzer test when he \nwas arrested, and that the result of the test was a .08 blood alcohol content (BAC). A \ncourt convicted him of DUI, sentenced him to one year in jail (part of which was \nsuspended and part of which he served on work-release), placed him on probation for \ntwo years, and ordered him to perform 96 hours of community service. The court also \nordered him to install an ignition interlock device on his vehicle and to take an eight-\nweek alcohol education class. He claimed that he took the class, but he could not \nremember the title of the class or where it was located. He also claimed that he took a \nyear of court-mandated alcohol-related counseling and was subject to urinalysis. He \nclaimed that he has not consumed any alcohol since he was arrested for this DUI. \nDespite being required to do so, he did not divulge this arrest on his SF 86. He \nvolunteered this arrest to the DOD investigator during his August 2020 security \ninterview before he was confronted. (Tr. 35-40, 46-47, 51-52; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn about September 2015, Applicant\u2019s employment was terminated by Company \nA because of his 2014 DUI. He did not divulge this termination on his SF 86, despite \nbeing required to do so. Instead, on his SF 86, he claimed that he had retired from \nCompany A. Applicant did not volunteer this termination before the DOD investigator \nconfronted him with it during his August 2020 security interview. He claimed that he did \nnot list this termination due to oversight. He sued Company A for wrongful termination, \nlost his claim in arbitration, and then lost again on appeal to a court of competent \njurisdiction. Given his lawsuit acknowledging that he had been terminated, I find that he \nwas being intentionally untruthful when he claimed on his SF 86 that he had retired from \nCompany A. (Tr. 35-36, 49-51; GE 1, 2) \nIn December 2019 and February 2020, Applicant\u2019s then-employer (Company B) \ndisciplined him for violations of their workplace policy. One of these violations, which \ninvolved not securing a tool, was alleged to have caused an accident. He also failed to \nproperly undergo required training. In March 2020, Company B terminated him for these \nworkplace violations. During his testimony, he claimed he is not sure why he was fired \nbecause Company B did not give him \u201cthe paper.\u201d Despite being required to do so, he \ndid not divulge this employment termination on his SF 86. He did not volunteer this \nemployment termination before the DOD investigator confronted him with it during his \nAugust 2020 security interview. Instead, on his SF 86, he wrote that he left this \nemployment with Company B because his contract ended. He also told the DOD \ninvestigator that he failed to list this termination because of oversight.

(Tr. 47-48; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nAs a result of this termination, Applicant was required to surrender his site badge \nthat allowed him access to the airport where he worked for Company B. Instead of \nsurrendering his badge, in about March 2020, he improperly used it to attempt to gain \nentry to a restricted area in the same airport to attend a job interview for another \nemployer. Airport security denied him entry and attempted to confiscate his site badge, \nbut Applicant refused to surrender it because he thought he had to surrender it to \nanother individual. During cross-examination, he claimed that he did not realize that his \nbadge was no longer valid and that he was not aware of the policy that required him to \nturn in his site badge once he had been terminated. (Tr. 48-49; Answer; GE 2) \nApplicant claimed that he filled out his SF 86 to the best of his ability and that it \ntook him a week to complete. He also claimed that he contacted his employer\u2019s security \nofficer for advice on properly completing it. (Tr. 35-38) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s aforementioned arrests and \nconvictions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g) and his termination from Company B for \nworkplace violations (SOR \u00b6 1.h). It also alleged his failure to surrender his invalid site \nbadge when he was terminated by Company B, and his use of this invalid badge to \nattempt to access a restricted area (SOR \u00b6 1.i). It alleged his failures to divulge his \ntermination from Company B and Company A on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k). \nFinally, it alleged his failure to divulge his 1975, 2008, and 2014 DUI arrests and \nconvictions on his SF 86 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant engaged in many instances of criminal behavior over a sustained \nperiod of time. He has also been fired from a job for violations of its policies, and he \nattempted to use an invalid badge to gain access to a secured area. AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nestablished. \nApplicant did not divulge several of his arrests and terminations from \nemployment on his SF 86 despite being required to do so. His explanations and \nexcuses for not divulging this information are inconsistent and defy logic. He \ndeliberately omitted this information from his SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established with \nrespect to his omissions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant has a long and sustained history of not abiding by established laws, \nrules, and regulations. That history is properly substantiated by his admissions and an \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFBI criminal history sheet. He deliberately omitted derogatory information from his SF \n86, and he also listed inaccurate information with respect to why two employers \nterminated him. I found his excuses and explanations for his actions to be inconsistent, \nto defy logic, and to be untruthful. He has not been candid or forthcoming throughout his \nclearance application process, including during his hearing. The only mitigating factor \nthat applies is AG \u00b6 17(a), and that only applies to his volunteering his 2014 DUI before \nbeing confronted by the DOD investigator during his security interview. Given his overall \nconduct, this instance of correcting one of his omissions does not provide sufficient \nevidence of mitigation. None of the Guideline E mitigating factors fully apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

She \nadmitted that she had been irresponsible in failing to file her tax returns on time and had \n\u201cnot been paying very close attention to [her] tax situation.\u201d (Tr. 65-66; GE 2 at 19.) SOR \n\u00b6 1.b has been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.c, which alleged that she is indebted \nto the Government for delinquent taxes of $35,336 for tax years from 2009 to the present. \nShe admitted that allegation and claimed that she is awaiting a payment plan from the \nIRS. \nApplicant was directed to Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, an IRS Form 656, Offer in \nCompromise. (Tr. 82.) That exhibit was signed by Applicant and her spouse on June 29, \n2023. (Tr. 24-25.) The exhibit states that her plan is to pay $105,000 over 24 months \n($4,375 per month), but the SOR states the amount owed is about $35,000. Applicant \nexplained that the $105,000 was an offer, but the amount owed is approximately \n$200,000, which includes interest, late fees, and penalties. She submitted this offer \nthrough her revenue officer at the IRS. She has not heard back from the IRS with the \nofficial paperwork. The revenue officer does not have authority to approve an Offer in \nCompromise. That officer is Applicant\u2019s liaison to the IRS. The Offer in Compromise is \nstill pending. (Tr. 83-86, 94-96.) \nApplicant was asked how she would be able to pay the $4,375 per month she put \nin her Offer in Compromise. She explained that she was waiting for several offers that \npaid \u201cwell over $100 an hour.\u201d There were several opportunities if her \u201cclearance was \ngranted.\u201d She also had offers from local governments and federal contractors that do not \nrequire a clearance. Some of those opportunities are \u201cnot an offer letter, but . . . if they \nlike my resume\u2019 then I can get a job.\u201d (Tr. 118-121.) \nApplicant testified that she cannot have a payment plan with IRS until there is an \napproved Offer in Compromise. She could, however, make \u201cgood faith\u201d payments to the \nIRS, so she gave her spouse money to make such payments. They were \u201csporadic\u201d \npayments made before and after her October 2020 meeting with the OPM investigator. \nShe made those payments from 2020 until she stopped working. Her spouse made \u201csmall \npayments\u201d to the IRS from 2009 to 2015. (Tr. 86-89.) She produced documentation \nshowing two \u201cgood faith\u201d payments. One was $503 for tax year 2018 received by IRS on \nNovember 18, 2021. The second was $1,500 for tax year 2020 received by IRS on \nDecember 13, 2021. (AE F and AE G.) SOR \u00b6 1.c has not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.d, which alleged that she is indebted \nto the state for $37,778 in taxes for tax years 2009 to the present. She was directed to a \nspreadsheet in Government Exhibit 2, page 21. She prepared this spreadsheet using her \nstate tax returns that were actually filed for tax years 2009 through 2021. It tracked her \ntaxes owed and tax refunds due for that time period. Between 2009 and 2021, she had a \n$3,022 total net credit. (Tr. 102-105.) This spreadsheet assisted her in convincing the \nstate to issue the April 23, 2021 tax release (for $43,301) that is part of her Answer. She \nhas satisfied her state tax obligation. (Tr. 104-105.)

Her three children live with her and her husband, and they \nsupport the children. She testified about her sources of income. Her spouse worked for \nthe Government for seven years and has a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but she does not. \nShe has never been a government employee and was always a contractor. She has no \nretirement fund. The TSP is one of their sources of income. She does not know the current \nbalance, but it started at $85,000. Her spouse only makes withdrawals as needed. When \nhis job was eliminated, he received $8,000 per month ($40,000 total) in severance. (Tr. \n108-112, 123.) \nApplicant has two cars. Her business car is a 2015 model she bought in 2021. Its \nengine is dead. The repair would cost $33,000; she paid $43,000 for it. She has filed a \nLemon Law claim. Her monthly payment is $798. (Tr. 113.) \nApplicant\u2019s family car is a 2012 model. She owes about $3,000 to $4,000 on it. \nShe is a couple of months behind on both car payments. (Tr. 113-114.) \nApplicant has no health care coverage. She has one unpaid medical bill for $300. \n(Tr. 117-118.) \nFood is about $2,000 per month. Utilities are about $800 to $1,000 per month. (Tr. \n112, 115.) \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage is $4,000 per month. This is the second month she has not \npaid the mortgage. (Tr. 111.) \nThe family entertainment is cable, cellphones, and the Internet, about $800 per \nmonth. They do not dine out. Applicant\u2019s hobby is watching documentaries. (Tr. 115-116.) \nApplicant visited her daughter at medical school five times between 2017 and \n2019. Each trip cost about $1,000. Applicant used credit cards to pay for those trips. Other \nthan those trips, Applicant has not taken any vacations or tours. (Tr. 129-132.) \nApplicant\u2019s sons are in college, and they graduate in 2024. Her daughter returns \nto medical school for September 2023 through December 2023, which is her last \nsemester. (Tr. 132.) \nOnly Applicant\u2019s oldest son contributes to the household income, about $400 per \nmonth. (Tr. 111.) \nApplicant keeps expenses as low as possible, just food, utilities, and cars; she \ndoes not send out dry cleaning. She and her family are living on credit cards. Her credit \ncard balance is about $16,000. (Tr. 112, 116-117,126-127.) \nApplicant\u2019s checking account balance is usually negative $1,000.

(GE 2.) She also retained a credit-repair service in about 2018 or 2019. She is not \ncurrently receiving financial counseling. (Tr. 127-128.) \nApplicant\u2019s two credit reports show the following financial picture (other than back \nfederal taxes). The October 2020 report shows 30 accounts. All accounts are PAYS AS \nAGREED. (GE 4.) The January 2022 report shows three collection accounts, one for $561 \nthat is marked PAID, one for $5,534 that is marked DISPUTED and CHARGED OFF, and \none for $233 that is open. (GE 3.) Applicant\u2019s financial status has apparently not yet been \nreflected on the two credit reports in the record. The record does not show a history of \nnot paying or an unwillingness to pay her household or consumer debts. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nOnly the following is potentially applicable in this case: \u201c(f) failure to file or . . . pay annual \nFederal, [or] state income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s tax liabilities are established by her admissions. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could potentially mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received \u2026 financial counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source . . . and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements. \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s federal income tax woes began many \nyears ago, dating to 2009. That was, of course, long ago. Those troubles, however, persist \nto this day and have yet to be unraveled and solved. Applicant only recently, on June 29, \n2023, signed an IRS Offer in Compromise. It has not been approved by the IRS. She \nadmitted that the debt owed to IRS is $200,000. Her offer was to pay $105,000 over 24 \nmonths at $4,375 per month. Those terms proposed by Applicant and her spouse seem \nunrealistic for them to meet, even if the IRS approves the offer. They are both unemployed \nand living on credit cards. They are behind on their mortgage and car payments with \nusually a negative balance in their checking account. Only one of their three adult children \nwho live with them contributes to the family budget. Applicant\u2019s current financial and tax \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances cast doubt on her current reliability. Mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has two requirements. First, the conditions causing financial problems \nmust have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d an applicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must have \n\u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse circumstances she confronted. Applicant\u2019s and her \nspouse\u2019s recent loss of employment are conditions largely beyond her control. She \nadmitted, however, that she had been irresponsible in failing to file her tax returns on time \nand had \u201cnot been paying very close attention to [her] tax situation.\u201d Thus, her loss of \nemployment did not cause her tax problems. It was irresponsible conduct in the past that \ncaused those problems. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant has received financial counseling in the \npast, which is to her credit. There are, however, no indications that such counseling has \nresolved her outstanding federal income tax problems or brought them under control. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) does not provide any significant mitigation. \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(g). The analysis under AG \u00b6 20(a) above applies \nequally here. There is no IRS-approved arrangement in place. To her credit, Applicant \ndid make two \u201cgood faith\u201d payments to the IRS (totaling $2,003) to be applied to back \nincome taxes owed. That does not, however, satisfy this mitigating condition \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her delinquent federal income taxes. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n \n Conclusion\nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

It also alleges that Applicant purchased marijuana from August 2015 until \nSeptember 2020. Applicant admits each of the SOR allegations.

Applicant also discussed her drug use with the investigator during \nher personal subject interview (PSI) in September 2021, and in her answer to the SOR. \nIn response to the questions under Section 21 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug \nActivity on her August 2021 e-QIP, Applicant set forth her use of illegal drugs and misuse \nof prescription drugs. In response to the \u201cprovide explanation\u201d sections of the drug-use \nrelated questions, Applicant described her drug use in a narrative format. She also \nprovided estimated dates of first use and last use. In response to the section where she \nwas required to \u201cprovide nature of use, frequency, and number of times used\u201d Applicant \nlisted the dates of use, her characterization of the frequency of use, and the drug used. \nApplicant also discussed her drug use during her September 2021 PSI. \nApplicant first smoked marijuana in the summer of 2015.

She disassociated herself from all her other drug-using associates at this \nuniversity. \nIn March 2017, while Applicant was visiting her remaining friend at the university \nApplicant previously attended, she used LSD on a single occasion. Applicant \ncharacterizes this use as experimental. \nApplicant stated on her e-QIP that she used cocaine twice in October 2017 while \nhanging out with some friends from her sorority. However, she told the investigator during \nher PSI that she used cocaine on another occasion while hanging out with the same \nfriends. She disassociated herself from the people with whom she used cocaine. \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she also used MDMA one time and misused \nAdderall one time in October 2017. She characterizes the use of these two drugs as \nexperimental. \nBetween June and December 2018, Applicant characterizes her marijuana use as \nfrequent, smoking marijuana on a weekly basis, primarily with her two housemates. One \nof her housemates was her remaining friend from the university Applicant previously \nattended. In June 2018, Applicant used LSD with her housemates. She characterizes this \nuse as experimental. Her friend from Applicant\u2019s former university moved out of their \nshared house in January 2019 and Applicant has not had any contact with this friend \nsince that time. \nApplicant misused Adderall occasionally between June 2018 and June 2019 with \nher housemate(s). She stated in her PSI that she misused Adderall a total of six to eight \ntimes total. Between January and June 2019, Applicant used marijuana on an occasional \nbasis with her remaining housemate. In March 2019, Applicant used LSD with her \nhousemate. She also used MDMA one time in March 2019. Applicant characterizes the \nuse as of these two drugs as experimental. Applicant has not associated with her former \nhousemate since December 2019. \nBetween June and August 2019, Applicant did not use any illegal drugs or misuse \nany prescription drugs because she was living in a \u201cdrug-free environment.\u201d Applicant \nwas living with her father. \nApplicant stated on her e-QIP that in August 2019, she moved into a new house \nwhere she had not met most of the people who also lived there. Applicant was unaware \nthat her housemates were drug users until after she had moved in. While living there until \nMarch 2020, Applicant describes her marijuana use as \u201cvery occasional.\u201d She also \n\u201coccasionally used LSD and experimented with DMT and psilocybin mushrooms.\u201d She \nstated that she used DMT one time and MDMA one time in October 2019 and psilocybin \nmushrooms one time in February 2020.

Applicant stated that after March 2020, she used LSD on a more infrequent \nbasis. She also stated that she used mushrooms two times between March 2017 and \nMarch 2021 but was not able to recall the exact dates. She stated that she used the \nmushrooms with friends, however she felt nauseous and vomited both times she used \nthem. \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she purchased marijuana from August 2015 \nuntil September 2020 \u201cfrom former drug-using associates on a small scale, for myself to \nuse, occasionally during this time period.\u201d \nBetween September 2018 and September 2019, Applicant purchased a small \namount of MDMA from a former associate. She also attempted to purchase MDMA online \non the \u201cdark web.\u201d \nThe dark web is the set of webpages on the World Wide Web that cannot \nbe indexed by search engines, are not viewable in the standard web \nbrowser, require specific means (such as specialized software or network \nconfiguration) in order to access, and use encryption to provide anonymity \nand privacy for users. https://www.merriam-webster.com \nIn March 2017, Applicant purchased LSD one time from a friend. On her e-QIP, \nshe explained that in September 2019 she purchased LSD through the \u201cdark web\u201d while \na friend guided her through the transaction. She stated she \u201cwas hesitant to use this \nmethod ever again and so did not.\u201d She also stated that she \u201cmay have exchanged cash \non other occasions as well but I do not remember exact dates or times.\u201d During her PSI, \nApplicant stated that she would purchase LSD on the \u201cdark web\u201d and it would then be \nmailed directly to her home. \nBetween October 2017 and December 2019, Applicant purchased Adderall from a \nfriend who had it. On her e-QIP, Applicant stated that she did not ever purchase cocaine. \nIn September 2019, she attempted to purchase cocaine on the \u201cdark web,\u201d however, she \nwas not successful. She submitted her payment and after the transaction was complete, \n\u201cit was clear that I would not receive this product.\u201d \nThroughout her responses to the drug-related questions on the e-QIP, Applicant \nrepeatedly listed the mitigating factors regarding her past drug use. Specifically, Applicant \nnoted her disassociation from her drug-using associates and her move in March 2020 out \nof an environment where drugs were used. \nIn March 2020, Applicant moved out of the house she had been living in with \nhousemates since August 2019 and moved in with her mother.

This demonstrates my disassociation from \nthese drug-using associates, as well as my changing or avoiding this \nenvironment were drugs were used.\u201d \nApplicant continued to use illegal drugs from March 2020 until March 2021. Her \nlast stated marijuana use was in June 2020. She describes her other drug use as follows: \nOccasional LSD use. One MDMA experimental use. Two of the LSD use \ncases were with two other people, one of whom is a friend I made in college, \nand the other was someone she went to high school with that I am not close \nwith. Since then, the friend I made in college has also, like me, made the \ndecision to lead a drug-free lifestyle. Another LSD use case was a situation \nwhere I was the only user, and was with a friend who is not a drug user. \nThis friend is very encouraging of me leading a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. \nThe final LSD and MDMA use case was with a friend who did not use LSD, \nbut used MDMA. This incident was potentially a contributing factor to this \nfriend\u2019s subsequent hospitalization. Since this incident, this friend and I \nhave both resolved to commit to a healthy, drug-free lifestyle. \nIt is unclear from Applicant\u2019s statements in her e-QIP and during her PSI if she \npurchased the marijuana, MDMA, and LSD that she used between March 2020 and \nMarch 2021, or how she otherwise obtained these drugs. \nOn her e-QIP, Applicant concluded her comments with the following statement: \nOverall, I acknowledge my former drug involvement and substance misuse \n. . . I have provided [evidence] of my actions that I have taken to mitigate \nconcern. I have disassociated from drug-using associates and contacts, \nand have changed and avoided the environment where drugs were used in \nthe past. I have an excellent support system of substance-free friends and \nfamily members, and am committed to and look forward to continuing to \nlead a healthy, happy, and drug-free life. \nApplicant stated during her PSI that she went through an experimental phase of \ndrug use while attending college and feels she has passed that period. She further stated \nthat she no longer associates with the same crowd of people and she is focused on her \ncareer and future. With her answer, Applicant provided a statement of intent to abstain \nfrom all drug involvement and substance misuse wherein she acknowledged that future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. Applicant \nstated her answer to the SOR that she disclosed her prior drug use to her employer. \nHowever, there is nothing in the record that suggests that Applicant\u2019s employer or any \nother entity with the power to revoke Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility is screening \nher for illegal drug use or substance misuse.  \n5\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn her April 2022 answer to the SOR Applicant stated: \nI acknowledge my drug involvement and substance misuse.

I have \nnot use substances since March 2021, and am demonstrating this \ncontinued sobriety by submitting to voluntary monthly drug tests with my \ndoctor since April 2022. \nIn the college environment I was a part of, drug use was normalized. This \nconsistent normalization in such an adolescent environment led to my drug \nsubstance misuse. Because of this normalization and, quite frankly, my \nstupidity at the time, I did not fully realize the impact of my actions, both on \nmy internal health and on my future career prospects. It was not until a friend \nof mine was hospitalized in March 2021, in part due to the substance use \nwe both partook in, that I really had a wake-up call and realized how poorly \nI had been treating my health. That realization, combined with the \nrealization that many of the serious career aspirations I had would require \na drug-free lifestyle, is what led me to making the decision to halt all \nsubstance misuse for good. I have not used drugs or misused substances \nsince March 2021. \nAdditionally, I have begun the process of seeking counseling with a licensed \nclinical therapist not only discuss how my past misjudgments have affected \nme, but also take a drug evaluation assessment to demonstrate an \napplicable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM. There is no record evidence of the results \nof Applicant\u2019s monthly drug tests that began in April 2022, nor is there any information\nregarding counseling.  \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person.

An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

However, from 2015 through March 2020, \nshe continued to make friends with and live with drug-using associates. Applicant also \nminimizes magnitude of her drug use on her e-QIP by referring to each of multiple uses of \nthe same drugs as \u201cexperimental.\u201d Additionally, she refers to having purchased LSD on \nmultiple occasions as having possibly \u201cexchanged cash\u201d for the drugs. Further, on her e-\nQIP, Applicant stated that she used cocaine twice and psilocybin mushrooms once. \nHowever, during her PSI, she admitted that she used cocaine three times and psilocybin \nmushrooms two times. \nApplicant emphasizes that in March 2020 she moved out of the house where her \nhousemates were drug users with whom she regularly used various drugs, \u201cto avoid the \nenvironment were drugs were used.\u201d She moved in with her mother where she currently \nresides. Yet, between March 2020 in March 2021, Applicant continued to use illegal drugs. \nSpecifically, at various points during this time period, Applicant used marijuana, DMT, \nMDMA, and LSD. She also continued to illegally purchase drugs. \nApplicant asserted that beginning in April 2022, she voluntarily underwent monthly \ndrug testing. She did not provide the results of any of those tests. Additionally, Applicant \nstated that she was actively seeking counseling to address her issues related to her prior \nillegal drug use and prescription drug misuse. There is no supporting documentary \nevidence that she is or was participating in counseling. Applicant did submit a statement \nof intent to abstain from future drug use, however, there is no evidence that shows that \nApplicant is subjected to any type of drug screening through her employment. \nThere are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the \nevidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn considering the totality of the evidence, particularly Applicant\u2019s long period of \nillegal drug use from 2015 until 2021, to include purchasing illegal drugs and prescription \ndrugs not prescribed to her, her minimizing of her drug-using conduct, and her repeated \ndisassociation with drug-using associates followed by Association with different drug-\nusing associates, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal use was recent and casts doubt on \nher current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Further, the record does not \ncontain any corroborating evidence of Applicant\u2019s assertions that she no longer uses \nillegal drugs. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c).

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant reported her illegal drug use and purchases and her prescription drug \nabuse and purchases on her e-QIP, discussed her drug-related conduct during her PSI, \nand admitted each of the SOR allegations and discussed her drug-related conduct in her \nanswer to the SOR. However, she is dismissive about her extensive illegal drug use and \ndrug-related conduct, stating that the normalization of drug-use in her college \nenvironments was the catalyst of her behavior. Yet, after she graduated from college in \nDecember 2019, she continued to use and purchase illegal drugs until March 2021. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline H and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by her conduct. Accordingly, I conclude she \nhas not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n10\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He makes $17 an hour and regularly works overtime. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance.

During the \nhearing, Applicant stated he received disability benefits beginning in approximately \n2008, after he suffered a neck injury on the job and was unable to work. His benefits \nwere extended after he had shoulder surgery. He listed on the January 2021 SCA that \nhe was self-employed as a barber from January 2008 through November 2019, during \nthe approximate ten-year period he received disability benefits. In about 2018, the SSA \ndetermined Applicant no longer met the requirements to receive disability benefits, and \nthat he had been overpaid disability benefits for over two-and-one-half years. Applicant \nappealed this decision and lost. He testified that he worked as a part-time barber from \n2008 to 2019 in an effort to earn a little extra money. Since his neck injury in 2008, he \nreturned to a full-time job in November 2019 after he was hired by another employer as \na security guard. (Tr. 21-35-36; GE 2, 3; AE E, I) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant agreed he received disability benefits for about ten \nyears. He received about $800 monthly from the SSA.

In 2021, he requested the SSA forgive this debt. Applicant testified that he is \nstill waiting to hear from the SSA to see if this request will be granted.

Based on the evidence he provided, he actually made his first payment of \n$100 to the SSA in September 2022. There is no other documentation to show he made \nother payments to the SSA.

After paying monthly \nexpenses, to include to one of his delinquent credit cards listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d, they had \na monthly net remainder of about $1,340. Immediately after the hearing, Department \nCounsel provided Applicant a new PFS to complete because the 2021 PFS was dated. \nApplicant agreed he would provide the updated PFS while the record was held open. \nHe did not submit this information. (Tr. 49-54; GE 3) \nApplicant provided contradictory information during cross-examination about \nwhether his federal and state income tax returns were filed for tax year (TY) 2021.

He later claimed the 2021 federal and state income taxes were filed, \nbut they owed delinquent 2021 income taxes, amount unknown. Department Counsel \nmade a motion to amend the SOR, and Applicant was given two weeks to respond to \nthe motion and provide updated tax information for TY 2021.

(SOR \u00b6 1.e) (Tr. 54-56, 61-65) \nPersonal conduct: \nApplicant completed his SCA in January 2021. He did not disclose any adverse \nfinancial information under Section 26 of the application, as required. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) He \nwas interviewed in February 2021 by an authorized DOD investigator during his \nbackground investigation. When asked if Applicant had any delinquent accounts within \nthe last seven years, he said \u201cNo.\u201d The investigator confronted him with an unpaid \n$6,851 medical account and two charged-off credit card accounts totaling $4,785. \nApplicant denied any knowledge of the medical bill, but he did recognize the two credit \ncard accounts. He was unaware that both credit card accounts were delinquent since \nhis wife handled the finances in the household. The investigator also confronted \nApplicant with the account placed for collection by the SSA in the amount of $25,554. \nApplicant stated that this account developed due to an overpayment of disability \nbenefits that were paid to him from approximately 2008 to 2018. He was notified by the \nSSA in about 2018 of the overpayment and that he was required to reimburse this \nfederal agency. He was unaware that his overpayment account was referred for \ncollection. (GE 2) \nDuring the hearing Applicant testified that he was truthful and upfront with the \nGovernment about his debt owed to the SSA. He thought he had listed it on the SCA, \nbut after reviewing the SCA during the hearing, he admitted that he had not disclosed it. \nHe also testified that when asked by the investigator if he had any delinquent debts, he \nimmediately told her about the SSA overpayment debt.

The report in evidence \nshowed that Applicant was confronted about the SSA overpayment account and that he \ndid not voluntarily disclose this information when questioned about delinquent debts by \nthe investigator. (Tr. 41-49; GE 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 says that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for \naccess to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds\u2026. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19, and the following three are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence in the record and Applicant\u2019s admissions show unresolved \ndelinquent debt and his failure to pay income taxes for TY 2021. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. An \napplicant is not held to a standard of perfection in his or her debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is that an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017); See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). \nApplicant requested the SSA to forgive the overpayment of $25,554 in disability \nbenefits that he received for over two-and-one-half years when he was not entitled to \nreceive these benefits. He did not provide any documentation that he is no longer liable \nfor this debt, or that he has been making systematic monthly payments to the SSA. He \ninformed the SSA that the injuries he sustained in 2008 prevented him from working, but \nhe continued to work during the ten-year period he received disability benefits. Applicant \nclaimed he was \u201cpretty sure\u201d he had notified the SSA he was working as a barber, but \nhe did not provide supporting documentation of this notification, as requested. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2021 PFS showed he had a monthly net remainder of \nabout $1,340 after paying his monthly expenses. The two largest debts in the SOR were \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot addressed until after the SOR was issued in August 2022. He was unable to \nestablish why he was unable to make more progress in resolving these delinquent \naccounts when he had the financial means to do so. He did not provide documentation \nto show whether he had resolved the 2021 outstanding tax debt. His financial problems \nare not resolved. His failure to adequately address his financial issues over time casts \ndoubt on his reliability and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant was aware he had an outstanding balance of over $25,500 owed to the \nSSA when he completed his SCA. He deliberately failed to disclose this information on \nhis SCA, as required. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant made a good-faith effort to correct the \nomission before he was confronted with the facts during his February 2021 background \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterview. During the hearing he claimed that he had listed the SSA overpayment on the \nSCA, but after reviewing the document, he acknowledged he did not list it. He also \ndenied that he was confronted by the investigator about his SSA overpayment account, \nbut after reviewing the signed interrogatory with an attached summary report, he was \nconfronted by the investigator about this information. Applicant intentionally omitted the \nSSA overpayment account when he filled out the SCA in January 2021. I find his \nomission casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) \nand (c) do not apply. Applicant failed to mitigate the personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant received disability \nbenefits beginning in 2008 that continued for approximately ten years. During the ten \nyears he received the benefits due to his inability to work, he was self-employed as a \nbarber for additional income. The evidence shows that he made a single $100 payment \non this significant government debt, and that first payment was made one month after \nthe SOR was issued. He failed to provide documentation to show the current status of \nhis 2021 unpaid taxes, or that he settled the unpaid medical account, his second largest \ndebt. He intentionally failed to disclose his SSA overpayment debt on his January 2021 \nSCA. Applicant\u2019s finances and personal conduct raise security concerns about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I have questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to classified material or assignment to \nsensitive duties. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He had periods of unemployment and underemployment. He also \nadmitted that he lived beyond his means. He was unable to pay all of his bills and a \nnumber of debts became delinquent. (Tr. at 15-16, 20, 23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 1, 2; AE A) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling about $35,640. Applicant \nadmitted that he owed all of the debts, but he stated that he was paying one of them, \nand the creditors for the remaining three debts charged off the debts as bad debts and \n\u201creleased [him] from any obligation to pay the debt[s].\u201d The debts include two credit \ncards, an account that he used to buy a motorcycle, and the deficiency owed on an auto \nloan after the vehicle was repossessed. \nApplicant paid a $1,607 debt that was not alleged in the SOR in April 2020. He \npaid a $570 debt that was not alleged in the SOR in 2020 or early 2021. (Tr. at 34-35; \nGE 2-6; AE H) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nJuly 7, 2021. He reported the SOR debts. He stated that with his new job, he would be \nable to satisfy all of his debts within a few months. He stated that he contacted the \ncreditor for one debt and he had \u201cbegun making minimum monthly payments of $50 [per \nmonth] until the debt is resolved.\u201d He stated that he also contacted the three remaining \ncreditors, and he was \u201cmaking minimum $50 monthly payments\u201d on one debt; and he \nwould start making $50 and $100 monthly payments on the last two debts. (GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation on July 30, 2021. He \ndiscussed his finances and delinquent debts. He indicated that he made payments on \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in 2020 while he was working overseas. He \nadmitted that he had not made any of the payments reported in the SF 86. Credit \nreports show that as of the date of the SOR, no payments on any of the SOR debts had \nbeen received since 2018. (Tr. at 24, 27-28; GE 2-6) \nApplicant entered into an agreement with the collection company for the $9,667 \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b on April 6, 2022, the same date he responded to the SOR. \nHe agreed to pay $62 every week for 156 weeks, through March 2025. He documented \nthat he made all of the weekly payments through October 2022, except one payment in \nAugust 2022 was returned for nonsufficient funds (NSF).

(Tr. at 25, 36; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, \nB, E, I) \nApplicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in October 2022 to assist \nhim in resolving his debts. He enrolled six debts, totaling $43,359, in the company\u2019s \ndebt-resolution program (DRP). The four debts alleged in the SOR, including the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b that he was paying, were included in the DRP. He agreed to make $320 \npayments twice a month to an escrow account. The debt-settlement company agreed to \nnegotiate settlements with his creditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow \naccount, minus their fees, to pay the settlements. The company estimated a payoff \namount of $31,368, with an estimated debt-free date of November 30, 2026. Applicant \ndocumented that he made the first two $320 payments. (Tr. at 24-32, 37; AE F, G) \nApplicant\u2019s finances have stabilized. His fianc\u00e9e is self-employed, and they are \nstaying with his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents. He has done a lot of studying, and he has adopted \nthe sound advice of experts on managing his finances. He stated that he is committed \nto maintaining the DRP through its resolution and paying his debts. He has a job offer \nfrom the parent company of his current employer for a cleared position, contingent upon \nhim receiving a security clearance. If he is granted a security clearance and gets that \njob, his finances will improve. He will lose his current job if he does not obtain a security \nclearance. (Tr. at 30-34, 40-43; AE A, D, J, K) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems and delinquent debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment after he left the \nmilitary because his father promised him a job that never materialized. He also admitted \nthat he lived beyond his means. Applicant\u2019s financial problems were partially beyond his \ncontrol. \nApplicant did not pay any of the SOR debts before he received the SOR, but he \nis credited with paying or settling two smaller debts before it was issued. He entered \ninto an agreement with one creditor to pay $62 every week for 156 weeks, through \nMarch 2025. From April 2022 through October 2022, he paid a total of $1,735 and \nreduced the balance owed to $7,994. He contracted with a debt-settlement company in \nOctober 2022 and enrolled the SOR debts in the company\u2019s DRP. He agreed to make \n$320 payments twice a month. He documented that he made the first two $320 \npayments. His finances have stabilized, and he asserted that he is committed to \nmaintaining the DRP through its resolution and paying his debts. \nEven with the small amount of payments to the SOR debts, this case could have \ngone Applicant\u2019s way if his payments matched his previous assertions. He wrote in his \nSF 86 that he had begun making $50 monthly payments on two debts and that he would \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstart making $50 and $100 monthly payments on the other two debts. He told the \nbackground investigator that he made payments on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b in 2020 while he was working overseas. None of those statements turned out to \nbe true. What I am left with is Applicant\u2019s statement that he intends to pay his debts \nthrough the DRP. However, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not \na substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See \nISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d There is \ninsufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will be \nresolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his debts. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions, individually or \ncollectively, are insufficient to eliminate concerns about Applicant\u2019s finances. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nhonorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He received a high \nschool diploma in 2006 and has taken some undergraduate courses. He was married in \n2013 and divorced in December 2019. He has a one-year-old child. He served on active \nduty with the U.S. Army from 2009 until May 2018 and received a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions. (Items 2-5; Form Response) \nOn an unspecified date, Applicant paid another individual to pose as Applicant to \ntake an information technology certification exam on his behalf because he did not \nbelieve that he could pass it if he took the certification exam himself. The individual that \nApplicant hired passed the certification exam, and Applicant was awarded the Security+ \nthrough COMPTIA certification as a result of his dishonest actions. This certification was \neither required for Applicant\u2019s employment or would enhance his standing with his \nemployer. In April 2021, Applicant reported this conduct to his employer, apologized for \nhis behavior, and resigned from his employment. It is unclear from the record whether \nhe reported this conduct prior to being confronted with it. (Items 1, 2, 6; Response to \nFORM). \nIn July 2017, Applicant was driving while intoxicated by alcohol. Military police \nstopped him after witnessing him fail to stop at a stop sign. They gave Applicant three \nportable breathalyzer tests. The results showed Applicant had a .116, .102, and .092 \nblood alcohol content (BAC). Applicant had been drinking at a bar for several hours and \ndrove home to meet base curfew. He was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI). \nAbout three weeks later, because of the DWI, he was disciplined pursuant to the \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 15. Applicant\u2019s rank was reduced, he \nwas sentenced to 45 days of extra duty and 45 days restriction. He was ordered to \nattend an Army Substance Abuse Program and was administratively separated from the \nArmy with a general discharge under honorable conditions in February 2018. (Items 2-5, \n7) \nIn about September 2017, Applicant physically assaulted his ex-spouse after \ngetting into an argument with her. Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse alleged that he body-slammed \nher, causing her to strike her arm heavily on a dresser and the floor. Applicant claimed \nthat he did not touch his ex-spouse, and that she struck him. Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse \ndenied striking him, claiming that she merely knocked his breakfast on the floor. Military \npolice responded to the incident. They noted bruising on Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse\u2019s arm \nconsistent with her version of events. Applicant claimed that his ex-spouse slipped on a \nshoe and fell into a dresser. Military police also noted scratches on Applicant\u2019s arm. He \nclaimed that his ex-spouse called military police because she thought she would get in \ntrouble for striking him. Applicant was arrested by military police but not formally \ncharged. While he was being questioned by military police, he alleged that he and his \nex-spouse had not had domestic abuse issues in the past. However, he acknowledged \nto a social worker during counseling that he and his ex-spouse had similar incidents in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2013 and February 2017. He claimed that these incidents involved his ex-spouse \nassaulting him. Regardless, this information is inconsistent with what he told military \npolice about the September 2017 incident being the first. In October 2017, the Army \nFamily Advocacy Program Case Review Committee determined that Applicant\u2019s ex-\nspouse qualified as a victim of physical abuse based upon this incident. In March 2019, \nthe Army authorized payments to Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse under a federal law that \nprovides for compensation to family members who have been physically abused by \nArmy servicemembers. These findings tend to corroborate his ex-spouse\u2019s version of \nevents. In 2019, Applicant and his (ex) spouse were divorced. (Items 2-5, 7-11) \nApplicant underwent outpatient mental health counseling in parts of 2012, 2015, \n2016, and from March 2017 until November 2017, while he was in the military. Applicant \nattended ASAP for approximately three months and a licensed psychologist diagnosed \nhim with an alcohol use disorder-mild. While Applicant was initially told to abstain from \nalcohol, his treatment records acknowledged that he could eventually consume alcohol \nagain in a modified, lower risk manner. Applicant abstained from alcohol from \napproximately July 2017 until the end of December 2019, when he began drinking about \ntwo glasses of wine two times per week. The last time he was intoxicated was July \n2017. He acknowledged formerly having a problem with alcohol. However, he claimed \nthat he now drinks responsibly and no longer has alcohol-related issues. (Items 2-5, 7) \nApplicant claimed that he is remorseful for the conduct listed in the SOR. \nHowever, he reiterated his claim that he did not physically assault his ex-spouse. He \nclaimed that he is trying to better himself through his college education and making \nbetter decisions. He twice made the dean\u2019s list at his college. He also claimed that he \nhas learned from his mistakes and that the birth of his one-year-old child has \ncontributed to his desire to be a better person. He provided character reference letters \nfrom those who know him who claim that he is trustworthy, responsible, dedicated, \nshows integrity, and is hard working. Some of the individuals who wrote letters note that \nhe has learned from his mistakes, but it is unclear whether any of these individuals are \naware of the allegations in the SOR. (Item 2; Response to FORM) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information. \nApplicant paid another individual to take a certification exam for him that was \neither required by his employer or would benefit his standing with his employer. He \ngained the certification under false pretenses. He then resigned from his employment \nbased upon this untrustworthy behavior. This behavior is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline, and it constitutes untrustworthy or unreliable behavior. AG \u00b6 16(d) \nis established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n (a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is not minor. It showed extremely poor judgment and a high \nlevel of dishonesty. He engaged in this gross breach of trust only about two years ago. \nWhile he reported the behavior, he provided no evidence as to whether he reported it in \ngood faith as opposed to reporting it because he knew he would be caught. He also \nprovided no evidence as to when he engaged in the behavior, so he cannot show that \nhis reporting was prompt. While he acknowledged the behavior, he provided no \nevidence of counseling after he engaged in the behavior. He has been taking college \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncourses and has had a child, but he has not shown how these things change the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to his untrustworthy behavior. \nGiven the seriousness of the conduct and its relative recency, I cannot find that it is \nunlikely to recur. I find that this behavior still casts doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the Guideline E mitigating conditions \napply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-spouse made a credible allegation that Applicant physically \nassaulted her in September 2017. While he was not charged with a crime, the Army \ndetermined that his ex-spouse was the victim of physical abuse. Applicant also drove \nwhile intoxicated by alcohol in July 2017. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAs it has been about five and one-half years since Applicant physically assaulted \nhis ex-spouse, at first blush, it would appear that a significant amount of time has \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npassed since he engaged in criminal behavior. However, I found that he physically \nassaulted his wife, which he continues to deny. I believe he is being untruthful about a \nmaterial fact relevant to a security clearance adjudication. Falsifying material \ninformation in a security clearance adjudication is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C.A. \n\u00a7 1001. Therefore, Applicant continues to engage in criminal behavior, undercutting his \nefforts at mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d), which require the passage of \ntime without recurrence of criminal acts. Given the recency of criminal activity, AG \u00b6 \n32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do not apply. AG \u00b6 32(c) does not apply because there is reliable \nevidence of criminal conduct in the form of credible allegations, police reports, and the \naforementioned finding by the Army. None of the Guideline J mitigating conditions \napply. The criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment\nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \nIn 2017, Applicant drove while intoxicated and was charged and disciplined. Also \nin 2017, a psychiatrist diagnosed him with alcohol use disorder-mild. AG \u00b6 22(a), AG \u00b6 \n22(c), and AG \u00b6 22(d) are established. AG \u00b6 22(e) and AG \u00b6 22(f) are not established. \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant was advised to abstain from \nconsuming alcohol indefinitely. The evidence showed that his social worker envisaged \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nan acceptable, lower risk form of alcohol consumption. Therefore, there is no evidence \nthat his current level of consuming two glasses of wine twice a week is inconsistent with \ntreatment recommendations. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \nIt has been about five and one-half years since Applicant has had an alcohol-\nrelated incident such as those described in AG \u00b6 22(a). He also has not been \nintoxicated since then. This extended length of time without alcohol-related incidents or \nintoxication provides sufficient evidence that Applicant no longer habitually consumes \nalcohol or \u201cbinges\u201d on alcohol to the extent that it impairs his judgment. The five and \none-half years that has elapsed is persuasive evidence that his excessive alcohol \nconsumption is unlikely to recur, and that it no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The alcohol consumption security concerns are \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines E, J, and G in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service and his positive personal references. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the personal conduct or criminal conduct security concerns, but he did mitigate \nalcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(\u00b6\u00b61.a, 1.b 1.c, \n2.a, and 2.b.) After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 58 years old.

(SOR \u00b6 2.a.) He testified at the hearing that he did not disclose this \ninformation because he was worried that he would lose his DOD security clearance and \nbe fired by his employer. He also admitted that he deliberately failed to disclose his use \nand purchase of marijuana to an authorized DOD investigator during his November \n2021 background interview. (SOR \u00b6 2.b.) Applicant told the investigator that he had \nstopped using marijuana ten years ago. The investigator was aware that Applicant had \nnot disclosed any illegal drug use during his previous investigation that had occurred \nabout ten years earlier. The investigator interrogated him further, and Applicant stated \nhe realized the investigator caught him in a lie. He was tired of lying about his marijuana \nuse and decided to disclose the full details about his marijuana use. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. \n17-21, 32-35) \nApplicant stated that even though he possessed a DOD security clearance at the \ntime he submitted the September 2021 SCA, he never had the intention to abstain from \nsmoking marijuana.

(Tr. 21) \nApplicant admitted that in August 1986, he was arrested and charged with \npossession of a controlled substance. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) He testified that he actually had two \nincidents of getting into trouble with the police for illegal drugs, but due to the age of the \narrest, he could not specifically recall any details about the incident. (Tr. 25-27; GE 2, \nGE 3) \nAccording to an interrogatory completed by Applicant on May 18, 2022, he listed \nthat he had used marijuana daily from January 1980 to May 17, 2022, and he had future \nintentions of using marijuana. Applicant testified that he did not use marijuana daily \nduring that entire period. When he was first hired by his employer, he believed he may \nhave abstained from using marijuana for about a year. He admitted during the hearing \nthat he continues to use marijuana. (GE 2; Tr. 27-29) \nApplicant admitted that he had also purchased marijuana while holding a DOD \nsecurity clearance. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) He disclosed during his background interview that he \nspends about $100 every two months to purchase marijuana from a friend who \npossesses a medical marijuana card. He smokes marijuana in the evenings to relax and \nit also helps with his arthritis pain. He testified that in September 2022, he obtained a \nmedical marijuana card and he has recently purchased marijuana from a dispensary. \nHe provided documentation from September 2022 that his application to participate in \nhis state\u2019s medical marijuana program had been approved. He was aware the use of \nmarijuana is illegal under federal law, and that the Federal Government and his \nemployer have a policy against people holding a security clearance and using illegal \ndrugs. (GE 2; Tr. 29-32, 35-36; AE C, AE D) \nApplicant submitted two character reference letters from his direct supervisor and \nthe operations manager from his place of employment. Both references praised \nApplicant\u2019s outstanding work ethic and personal commitment to the mission. They \nbelieve Applicant is an asset for his employer and the DOD. (AE A, AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);\u201d and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase . . . .\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c). \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from drug involvement and substance misuse. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were being \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has used marijuana from about \n1980 to the present time, and during many of those years while he possessed a DOD \nsecurity clearance. He knew that the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, and \nthat the Federal Government and his employer have a policy against people holding a \nsecurity clearance and using illegal drugs. Applicant\u2019s purchase, possession, and use of \nmarijuana cast doubts on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, and suitability to hold a \nclearance, especially because his substance misuse occurred while he possessed a \nclearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant deliberately falsified his September 2021 SCA by intentionally failing to \ndisclose his use and purchase of marijuana while holding a DOD security clearance. \nDuring his November 2021 background interview, he deliberately falsified his marijuana \nhistory when questioned by an investigator. His admissions and evidence in the record \nshow that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant intentionally falsified his 2021 \nSCA, and he deliberately failed to disclose his illegal drug use and purchase during his \nNovember 2021 background interview. He admitted he lied because he was worried \nabout losing his security clearance and his job. Applicant only admitted his illegal drug \ninvolvement to the investigator after he had been caught in a lie. This conduct does not \ndemonstrate a prompt, good-faith effort to correct his previous omissions and \nfalsifications. He has a pattern of dishonesty, which casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and overall good judgment. The personal conduct security concerns \nare not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana while holding a security clearance places a heavy \nburden on him to establish mitigation. It is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable \nclearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \nI \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nAfter considering the record as a whole, to include his positive work performance \nand the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s use and purchase of marijuana, \nconclude that Applicant has not met his heavy burden of proof and persuasion due to \nhis longstanding and current use of marijuana, and his history of omissions and \nfalsification for over 20 years while he held a security clearance. His pattern of \ndishonesty and his intention to use marijuana in the future continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability and trustworthiness. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline H and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: Against Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Each of the SOR \naccounts were individual accounts opened in Applicant\u2019s name. The six SOR debts \nbecame delinquent between April 2017 and December 2017. The last payments on five \nof those six accounts were between December 2016 and April 2017. (Items 10 and 11.) \nIn an addendum to his interrogatory responses, Applicant explained his financial \ncircumstances, which are summarized below: \nIn January 2017, his father-in-law died unexpectedly causing related \nexpenses. In February 2017, his wife had surgery and developed \ncomplications that kept her out of work for eight weeks. In that same month, \nhe retired from the Air Force and was working only two to three days a week. \nHe did not receive disability payments until April 2018. Those events caused \nfinancial hardship for his family.

(Item \n1.) He denied those allegations. (Item 2.) He did not disclose those debts in his August \n2021 SCA. (Item 3.) \nIn addition to his short denials of the Guideline E allegations, Applicant submitted \na more detailed explanation, the pertinent part of which follows: \nThis is mostly to an oversight on my part, was not trying to deceive \nat all. I was charged in 2007 for an incident that happened back in 1997. It \nwent to an Article 32 hearing where the accusations were proven false and \nall the charges were dismissed. So that was my fault not thinking, because \nI was on the list for deployment I asked if this would affect it from what I can \nrecall my counsel telling me that since it was over and everything was \ndismissed it is like it never happened. So I was not trying to be untruthful. \nOn the 2014 Equip questionnaire I answered no and did not get any \nquestions back about this. Also when it was asked on the 2021 equip I was \nonly going back 10 years since I figured that was what was needed for a \nSecret Clearance. So again I was not trying to be untruthful was just looking \nat the scope. . . . (Item 2.)  \nThe record has a Charge Sheet showing that on April 16, 2007 Applicant was \ncharged under UCMJ Article 120 with a rape that took place on February 19,1999.

His explanation recounted graphic descriptions \nof the day and the evening in question. He specifically denied the accusations made by \nthe accuser. He also provided details of exculpatory evidence. (Response at 9.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an   \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by the Government\u2019s credit reports. \nApplicant stated that he would not need to make any \u201cfinancial changes\u201d to pay off his \ndebts. And his Personal Financial Statement shows a healthy net monthly remainder \n($5,692). His Answer said that \u201cany debts incurred will be taken care of.\u201d They have not \nbeen. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay  \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.   \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR accounts became delinquent in 2017. That is fairly long ago. But \nthey remained in default at the time the SOR was issued. Also, those debts were not \ninfrequent. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to mitigate those debts. \nMitigating factor AG \u00b6 20(b) has two principal elements. First, there must be \n\u201cconditions\u201d \u201clargely beyond the [applicant\u2019s] control\u201d that caused the financial problem. \nSecond. The applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse circumstances \nhe confronted. \nYear 2017 presented Applicant with a number of challenging circumstances. His \nfather-in-law died unexpectedly in January. In February, his wife underwent surgery that \ncaused her to miss work for two months. And his disability checks were delayed until April \n2018. Those events caused financial hardship. They were \u201clargely beyond\u201d Applicant\u2019s \ncontrol, thus satisfying the first element of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly under those adverse \ncircumstances. In this case, he used credit cards to \u201ccover the lost [sic] of income.\u201d That \nis consistent with the credit reports showing the SOR accounts becoming delinquent in \n2017. By way of context, after her surgery, his spouse resumed work in about mid-2017. \nIn 2018, he worked full time as a contractor or as an employee for his current employer. \nAs noted, he began receiving disability payments in April 2018. Aside from making one \npayment on one SOR account in August 2021, he has made no payments to the other \nSOR accounts since 2016 or 2017. They apparently have been ignored. That is not \nresponsible conduct. The second element of AG \u00b6 20(b) is not satisfied. Applicant\u2019s SOR \ndebts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nApplicant stated that he is making or plans to make payments to the creditors of \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and b. He has not, however, provided any documents supporting that \nassertion. The Appeals Board has routinely held that it is reasonable to expect applicants \nto produce documentation supporting their efforts to resolve debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). Applicant has not satisfied that basic requirement. \nTherefore, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant stated that he has disputed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1. c, e, and f. Mitigating condition \nAG \u00b6 20(e) requires \u201cdocumented proof\u201d to \u201csubstantiate the basis of the dispute\u201d or \n\u201cevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d He has provided neither. AG \u00b6 20 (e) does not \napply. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts have been resolved or mitigated. I find against \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d A statement or omission is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately \n(knowingly and willfully). \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose the \n2007 rape charge in his May 2014 SCA and his August 2021 SCA. He denied those \nallegations. The record, however, proves the truth of those allegations. He was charged \nwith rape on April 16, 2007. This conduct falls squarely within AG \u00b6 16(a), which states in \npertinent part: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations.  \nAG \u00b6 17(a) states in pertinent part a mitigating condition that may mitigate that \ndisqualifying condition: \n[The] individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts. \nApplicant failed to disclose the 2007 rape charge in his May 2014 SCA and in his \nAugust 2021 SCA. This proceeding is not to revisit the legitimacy of the rape charge. It \nwas thoroughly Investigated by the Air Force, and the charge was dismissed. The issue \nhere is whether he deliberately omitted that charge from two SCAs. \nApplicant is correct that the charge was made when he was young and newly-\nmarried. A charge of felony rape, however, is momentous at any age. The three-week \ninvestigation before it was dismissed surely was personally distressful for him. But that \nepisode was only seven years before he needed to complete his May 2014 SCA. That he \nasked a lawyer about answering \u201cNo\u201d shows he had misgivings about that answer. \nWhen he completed the 2014 SCA and the 2021 SCA, he had over 20 years of \nexperience as an airman. He had held security clearances before. Moreover, the SCA \nquestion asked whether applicant had EVER been charged with a felony (emphasis \nadded)? That use of UPPER CASE letters is intended to call attention that the question \ngoes back EVER in time. Finally, perhaps the most telling evidence is the great level of \ndetail about the rape incident that he included in his Response to the FORM. These many \nyears later, that incident is still quite fresh in his memory. That is understandable, but it \nshould have been disclosed in his 2014 SCA. \nHaving omitted the rape charge from his 2014 SCA, Applicant was presented with \nan opportunity to correct that omission when he needed to complete the 2021 SCA. He \ndid not, however, use that opportunity to correct his 2014 omission. Instead, he omitted \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe rape charge from the 2021 SCA, as well. I find that he deliberately omitted the rape \ncharge from his 2014 and 2021 SCAs. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2 a.-d. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleged that Applicant falsified facts by failing to disclose the delinquent \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f in his 2014 and 2021 SCAs. He denied those \nallegations. The record shows, however, that he did not disclose those debts in those two \nSCAs. The question is whether that omission was deliberate. During the investigation, he \nrepeatedly denied having significant knowledge about his family finances. According to \nhim, his wife handled the family finances. That custom was interrupted in February 2017 \nwhen his wife had surgery, and he took over that chore while she recuperated. Applicant\u2019s \ninterrogatory responses show that even at this late date, his family finances are still not \nunder control. I attribute that, however, to carelessness or negligence, not to a deliberate \nomission of the SOR debts. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

(Tr. 26, 37-38, 47-49; Answer; \nGE 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $16,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f). These delinquencies consist of an \noverdrawn bank account (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a vehicle loan (SOR \u00b6 1.b), unpaid automobile \ninsurance (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f), a utility (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and a credit card (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He \nadmitted the SOR allegations with additional comment. His admissions are adopted as \nfindings of fact. (SOR; Answer) \nThe overdrawn bank account in the amount of $11,469 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has \nnot been resolved. Applicant overdrew this account when he quit his job in February \n2020 and failed to stop previously scheduled automatic withdrawals. He claimed that he \nthought the balance was inaccurate and, when he called the collection agency in June \n2022, it allegedly agreed that he only owed $1,469. On June 10, 2022, he made a \npayment of $105 on this account. He provided documentation to corroborate this \npayment. He did not provide documentation to corroborate the lower balance. He has \nnot taken additional action on this account after making the June 10, 2022 payment, but \nhe plans to do so in the future. (Tr. 26-28, 49-52, 71-72; Answer; GE 2-6; AE A) \nThe delinquent vehicle loan in the amount of $4,118 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b has \nnot been resolved. Applicant provided documentary evidence that, after the hearing, he \nmade a $100 payment on this account on March 21, 2023. The account became \ndelinquent in February 2019 when he voluntarily surrendered the secured collateral \nbecause he could not afford to make the required payments. Prior to his March 21, 2023 \npayment, he last made a payment on this account in April 2020. He plans to make \npayment on this account in the future.

The debt does not appear on the latest Government credit report. (Tr. 30-31, \n52-53, 73-74; Answer; GE 2-5; AE A) \nThe delinquent utility for internet services in the amount of $367 alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d has not been resolved. Applicant first became delinquent on this account in \nDecember 2020. He claimed that he paid this account in full, but he only provided \ndocumentary corroboration of a $90 payment in September 2022. He claimed that he \nthought the account is no longer delinquent because it no longer appears on an \nundisclosed credit report. However, the debt still shows as delinquent on all the \nGovernment credit reports.

Despite Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony that he does not believe he has resolved this account, two of the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports reflect this account is a paid charge-off that was paid in \nJune 2021. (Tr. 31, 53-55; Answer; GE 2-6) \nThe delinquent insurance account in the amount of $97 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f has \nbeen resolved. This account became delinquent in April 2021. Applicant claimed that he \npaid this account in full on an undisclosed date. He provided no documentary \ncorroboration of a payment. However, this debt appears on the Government\u2019s April \n2021 credit report, but not on the 2022 and 2023 Government credit reports. (Tr. 30-31, \n52-53, 74; Answer; GE 2 and 3) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to several causes. He was unemployed \nfrom February 2020 until December 2020 because he quit his job while suffering from \ndepression and loneliness. He claimed that his credit has been bad his whole life. He \nacknowledged that he does not pay sufficient attention to his finances partly because he \ndoes not care enough about them. While it is not alleged in the SOR, he has had two \nadditional vehicles repossessed in the past. Any adverse information not alleged in the \nSOR, such as Applicant\u2019s additional vehicle repossessions, will not be considered for \ndisqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s \ncredibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful \nrehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He claimed that he will pay off the delinquent SOR accounts \nin the future, but he also made such claims multiple times beginning as early as March \n2021. (Tr. 28-30, 38-46, 55-58, 60-61, 76-77; Answer; GE 1 and 2) \nSince February 2021, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay has been about $3,600 per \nmonth. He does not follow a budget and did not provide evidence that he has received \nfinancial counseling. He pays his father $500 per month for rent and a phone. He pays \n$600 per month on a car that he purchased via financing in April 2022, and $220 per \nmonth for auto insurance.

(Tr. 63-71) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had six delinquent debts totaling about $16,000. Many of those debts \nhave been delinquent for years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and \n19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and therefore recent. Half of the \nSOR debts, including the two largest, remain unresolved. Given his statements about \nhis inability to save, budget, or pay attention to his finances, I cannot find that his \nfinancial issues are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of his unemployment when he quit his \njob. These conditions were beyond his control. However, his financial issues also arose \nbecause of his admitted negligence about his finances. These conditions were within his \ncontrol. To the extent conditions were beyond his control, for AG \u00b6 20(b) to apply, he \nmust also show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these \ndebts. While he resolved some of the smaller SOR debts, he largely did so after he \nreceived the SOR. On several of the unresolved SOR debts, he made a relatively small \npayment after the SOR was issued, but he did not continue making payments. Given \nthese considerations, he has failed to show that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances and AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his delinquent debts came after he received \nthe SOR. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been \nplaced on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). AG \u00b6 \n20(d) does not apply. \nApplicant disputed the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a and claimed that the \ncreditor acknowledged that the balance is lower than that listed on the SOR. However, \nhe provided no documentary evidence to corroborate the lower balance. It is reasonable \nto expect Applicant to present documentation about the resolution of specific debts. See \nISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). Regardless, he admitted owing \na balance on the account, and acknowledged that except for one payment he made on \nthis account after the SOR was issued, this debt remains unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply. \nNone of the Guideline F mitigating factors are fully applicable.

Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant illegally purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from \nabout 2017 until November 2020. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nis potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant has not purchased or used marijuana for over three years. This time \nspan is significant. He credibly testified that he will not purchase or use marijuana again \nbecause it negatively affects his mental state. Given the totality of his past drug use, his \ncredible testimony, and his lengthy period of refraining from use, I believe that he has \nestablished a sufficient period of abstinence from illegal drugs and that his illegal drug \npurchase and use is unlikely to recur. I conclude his past, illegal drug involvement does \nnot cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns are mitigated. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and H in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. He mitigated the drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He earned two bachelor\u2019s degrees and earned credits \ntowards a master\u2019s degree. He was married to his first wife from December 2016 until she \npassed away in 2019. He remarried in March 2023. He has worked for his current \nemployer, a federal contractor, since 2015. (Tr. 20; GE 1) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s first marriage, his wife suffered from mental illness. She had a \nchild from a previous relationship, and Applicant treated his stepdaughter like his own. \nApplicant testified that he was aware his wife had experienced significant and intense \ntrauma in her past. She was abused by a previous boyfriend and had childhood trauma. \nShe was participating in talk therapy, cognitive therapy, and was on medication. He and \nhis first wife were together for about two and a half years before they married. He raised \nhis stepdaughter almost by himself from the age of three until she was seven years. His \nwife was a flight attendant and would be gone for extended periods of time, and Applicant \nwould care for the child. He and his stepdaughter had a close relationship. In early 2017, \nhe and his wife attended marriage counseling to address communication issues. The \ncounselor recommended he seek individual counseling. (Tr. 21-27, 79) \nApplicant sought mental health treatment from a health center (HC) in April 2017. \nHe reported to the mental health professional (MHP) that he was having difficulty focusing \nand concentrating. He was diagnosed with attention deficient/hyperactivity disorder \n(ADHD). He was prescribed medication. He stated that he also participated in treatment \nbrought on by his relationship with his wife who was undergoing treatment for depression \nand extreme post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He said she had an ongoing \ndiagnosis of alcoholism and borderline personality disorder. He explained that as her \npartner and a person who loved her, these conditions led to stress and trauma in dealing \nwith her behavior.

Applicant testified \nthat he now manages his ADHD through diet, sleep, and exercise and is no longer on \nmedication. (Tr. 22, 25-27, 42, 51-54; Answer to SOR; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that his wife was prescribed medication for her mental health \nissues and was experiencing side effects, such as hallucinations and delusions. She was \nalso abusing alcohol. She had participated in alcohol detoxification a couple of times. Her \nmedications were changed, but her symptoms and side effects worsened. He testified \nthat he was arrested in August 2017 on charges of domestic violence. He testified that \nhis wife was not taking her prescribed medication, and he thought she was having \nflashbacks. He said that his wife attacked him, and he defended himself by wrapping his \narms around her. He had injuries to his face. He was arrested for domestic violence but \nthe charges were later dropped. (Tr. 29-30, 45-47, 55-59) \nApplicant testified that in August 2017, his wife left him, and she left her daughter \nin his care. He was the sole provider for his stepdaughter until November 2017 when the \npolice arrived at his home on Thanksgiving Day and escorted his stepdaughter from the \npremises. He understood that he had no legal rights to her, and he only ever saw her a \nfew more times. Applicant was distraught and grieving at the loss of his stepdaughter. In \nNovember 2017, he reported to his MHP that he was experiencing anxiety due to his \nseparation from his wife and loss of contact with his stepdaughter. He continued his \nregular appointments. (Tr. 22-25, 30, 62; Answer to the SOR) \nIn late December 2017, he learned that his wife had aborted their child. They had \ntried to conceive for two years but struggled due to his wife\u2019s physical health issues and \nwere unsuccessful. The combination of losing access to his stepdaughter and learning of \nthe abortion made him more depressed and mired in grief. In January 2018, he sought \ntreatment and was admitted to a mental health facility for suicidal ideations. He continued \nhis therapy to approximately April 2018 for grief because of the loss of his stepdaughter \nand familial stress. (Tr. 28-30, 66; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant disclosed on his January 2018 Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86) that in January 2018 he purchased and used marijuana three times \nduring one weekend while living in a state where it is legal. He had a security clearance \nat the time but did not have access to classified information. He testified that because of \nall of the family issues he was experiencing, with the loss of custody of his stepdaughter, \nand the separation from his wife, he thought he would try marijuana to relieve the stress. \nHe believed because it was legal under state law, he was permitted to use it. He credibly \ntestified that he was unaware that he was not permitted to use marijuana under federal \nlaw, but also acknowledged he should have known better. He has not used marijuana \nsince that weekend and does not intend to use it in the future. He provided a signed letter \nof intent to never use or possess illegal drugs or misuse legal drugs in the future and \nagreed that his security clearance could be revoked if he violated his promise.

He \nprovided a letter from his mother who said she had visited her son in June 2018, and he \ndisclosed to her that he had used marijuana to help cope with the separation from his wife \nand stepdaughter. She had concerns about the policy of his employer because marijuana \nwas legal in the state where he lived. She said her son told her that he believed it was \npermissible to use. (Tr. 47; AE D, H, I, P) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was arrested for domestic violence against his wife. \nApplicant denied he committed any act of violence. He believed it was a plot devised by \nhis wife so he would be in jail and she could obtain items from the marital home. He \nindicated the incident was entirely fabricated and he had an alibi to her accusations in \nthat he was not where she claimed he was located. He believed the allegation was made \nto obtain legal leverage for their pending divorce or were attributed to his wife\u2019s mental \nhealth issues because he believed she was not taking her medications and was \nconsuming alcohol. He attributed her obtaining restraining orders against him in \nSeptember 2018 and May 2019 to the same purposes as noted above. The charges and \norders were all dismissed when Applicant\u2019s wife failed to appear in court. (Tr. 29-30, 41, \n45-47, 77; Answer to the SOR) \nDuring marriage counseling, Applicant disclosed that he was depressed and \nmentioned he had suicidal ideations. In December 2018, Applicant was at home and \nasleep. His wife tried to contact him by telephone and when he did not answer, she called \nthe police. He explained to the police that he was seeking treatment for grief and was \ndealing with depression, but it was being handled through his private MHP. For reasons \nunbeknownst to him they admitted him under the Baker Act to a mental health facility. \nApplicant believes this was an attempt by his wife to ruin his reputation and gain leverage \nin their divorce proceeding. Applicant admitted he had suicidal ideations but did not \nattempt suicide. (Tr. 31,37-41, 66, 82-87) \nApplicant\u2019s discharge summary from his December 2018 hospitalization notes that \nhe was communicating with his ex-wife and was venting and instead of her calming him, \nshe began screaming at him. He attempted to tell her that because of the way she treated \nhim and interacted with him, he had become suicidal in the past. That was the end of the \nconversation, until the police arrived at his door. He denied he had attempted to \ndeliberately harm himself. He had positives in this life and was gainfully employed. He \nwas receiving support from his mother and brother and had strong religious beliefs. He \nwas looking forward to a trip to India. He was discharged in January 2019 with a diagnosis \nby a medical doctor of depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, major depressive \ndisorder, single episode, unspecified, and unspecified depressive disorder. He testified \nthat he was told to continue seeing his therapist.

She last saw him in December 2019 when they \nmutually decided to terminate services. He testified that they agreed he had continued \ntherapy to the point where it was no longer necessary, and at that point he had a game \nplan to address any issues that may occur or bouts of grief he may experience. (Tr. 34-\n35, 66-75, 80-82, 87; AE C) \nApplicant testified that his wife attempted suicide five times while they were \nmarried. In September 2019, she succeeded. She left a suicide note, hung herself, and \nwas found weeks later at her house. It was determined that her cause of death was \nsuicide. (Tr. 45) \nOn January 17, 2022, Applicant was evaluated by a government-approved \npsychologist, Dr. B. Based on her clinical interview, available medical and mental health \ntreatment records, testing observations, and results of the Personality Assessment \nInventory (PAI), she determined Applicant met the criteria for major depressive disorder, \nrecurrent, severe in remission, bipolar disorder R/O1 and Cluster B personality traits.2 She \nnoted Applicant had a history of psychiatric hospitalizations and domestic violence issues. \nHe also had episodes of increased energy and activity as well as episodes of major \ndepression. He was not in treatment for these conditions because she noted that \nApplicant felt he did not need mental health treatment. His prognosis was poor because \nhe was not interested in treatment, which Dr. B noted would need to be regular and \nongoing to prevent relapses of depression and possibly mania. She said due to \ninconsistencies she noted in information he provided to her and to the government \ninvestigator regarding his security clearance application it suggested he was dishonest. \nShe noted his use of marijuana while he had a security clearance, which he \nacknowledged, also gave her concerns, although she did not discuss this as impacting \nhis psychological issues. She had significant concerns about his judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. (GE 4) \nApplicant testified that he disagreed with many things Dr. B stated in her report \nnoting they were inaccurate. He noted that his virtual evaluation was between one and \ntwo hours. Her conclusions that he perpetrated acts of domestic violence were not true. \nHe noted she opined that he had unpredictable and violent behavior, which was untrue \nand based on false reports from his ex-wife. He said Dr. B saw this as inconsistent \nreporting and dishonest. He adamantly disagreed with her interpretation and willingness \nto accept these accusations without considering his information. Dr B. concluded that he \nhad episodes of increased energy and activity, such as formulating a plan to travel to \n1 www.rxlist.com:Rule out (R/O) term used in medicine meaning to eliminate or exclude something from \nconsideration. For example, a normal chest x-ray may \u201crule out\u201d pneumonia. \n2 The DSM-5 notes that personality disorders under Cluster B, which is called the dramatic, emotional, and \nerratic cluster, include Borderline Personality Disorder, Narcissistic Personality Disorder, Histrionic \nPersonality Disorder and Antisocial Personality Disorder. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIndia, which were a concern. Applicant had planned a trip to India for a wedding that was \nsubsequently canceled because the wedding was canceled. He took a trip to Aruba after \nhe had completed his two bachelor\u2019s degrees because he was exhausted and not \nbecause he was using sleep as a coping mechanism for a manic episode. He denied he \nexhibited unpredictable and erratic behavior. He denied he lied and had recurring \nproblems with the law, was aggressive, violent, and impulsive. He also disagreed with her \nevaluation that he was dishonest. Dr. B noted that he was in a tumultuous relationship \nwith his wife and had suicidal ideations during this time, which prompted a diagnosis of \nmajor depressive disorder, and she had concerns that he was not currently in treatment. \nWhen he was evaluated by Dr. B, he was no longer married as his wife had been \ndeceased since 2019. She noted that he reported on his security clearance application \n(January 2020) that he was going through some hard times but was in therapy and doing \nbetter. She said if he did have some insight for treatment, he did not have it at the time of \nthe evaluation and therefore his prognosis was poor. (Tr. 32-33, 102-112; GE 4) \nApplicant was re-evaluated in June 2022 by a licensed psychologist (LC). The LC \nnoted that she had experience treating various disorders, particularly depressive \ndisorders. They discussed his past suicidal ideations, Baker Act hospitalization, the loss \nof his stepdaughter and ex-wife. They also discussed his history of grief and his past \ncounseling with Dr. MS. LC noted that Applicant reported that he was previously given \nthe Personality Assessment Inventory and the screening yielded Bipolar Disorder. (This \nis incorrect according to Dr. B Bipolar Disorder had to be ruled out.) LC administered \nassessments for anxiety and depression. His scores were nonsignificant in the \u201cnone-\nminimal\u201d range. She also reviewed the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar I, II, and Major \nDepressive Disorder. Of the three disorders, Applicant only \u201cendorsed 1 symptom of \nMajor Depressive Disorder (diminished ability to concentrate/think) and the diagnosis \nrequires 5 or more symptoms to be endorsed.\u201d (AE A) In LC\u2019s professional opinion, \nApplicant does not currently meet the criteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar I \nor Bipolar II Disorders. (Tr. 34, 89-102; AE A) \nApplicant testified that he loved his first wife, despite their tumultuous relationship, \nwhich he attributed to her PTSD and trauma she experienced, along with her abuse of \nalcohol. The loss of custody of his stepdaughter had a devastating impact on him \nemotionally and mentally. When he learned his wife committed suicide, she had been \ndeceased for several weeks before her body was found. Although their marriage had \nfailed, she had been his best friend and he loved her. He could not understand why she \nwould not take her medication. (Tr. 29) \nApplicant remarried in 2023. He provided a letter from his new wife who is aware \nof the allegations in the SOR. She has known Applicant for four years. She has noticed \npositive changes in how he copes with his grief and loss. She noticed a substantial \nchange in the first year of knowing him and continued consistency in the three subsequent \nyears. She supports him in his goals.

(Tr. 47-49; AE G, J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that Applicant sought treatment from a mental health center \nfrom April 2017 to April 2018.

Seeking mental health treatment is not \na disqualifying condition. A suicidal ideation is not a suicide gesture or attempt. There are \nno disqualifying conditions that apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. I find for Applicant on these \nallegations. \nApplicant was admitted to a health center in approximately December 2018 via the \nBaker Act and diagnosed with depressive disorder, not elsewhere classified, major \ndepressive disorder, single episode, unspecified, and unspecified depressive disorder. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and 28(c) apply. \nApplicant was diagnosed by a government-approved psychologist in January 2022 \nwith major depressive disorder, recurrent, severe in remission and cluster B personality \ntraits. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that Applicant was diagnosed with Bipolar \nDisorder by Dr. B. He was not. Her diagnosis was reported as \u201cR/O Bipolar Disorder\u201d in \nthat Bipolar Disorder has to be ruled out, but it had not been yet. \nDr. B\u2019s report notes Applicant has cluster B personality traits. Although anecdotal, \nshe did not note a specific personality disorder as disqualifying as required under AG \u00b6 \n28(b). There were limited behavioral examples provided to help understand how Dr. B \narrived at her conclusions. Dr. B relied on historical data without providing context or an \nopportunity for Applicant to provide insight into factors that contributed to conflicting \ninformation. It appears that she did not consider that there may be another side to the \nstory. She failed to note the seriousness of the stressors he had while dealing with his ex-\nwife who was suffering from PTSD and alcohol issues and the loss of his stepdaughter. \nApplicant sought counseling and treatment to deal with his grief, which is exactly what is \nrecommended. She noted that his PAI was mildly elevated but did not provide the actual \nT-score and the fact that there may be other reasons a score could be elevated. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nSection 21 of the SF 86-Psychological and Emotional Health states: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe U.S. government recognizes the critical importance of mental health \nand advocates proactive management of mental health conditions to \nsupport the wellness and recovery of Federal employees and others. \nEveryday individuals with mental health conditions carry out their duties \nwithout presenting a security risk. While most individual with mental health \nconditions do not present security risks, there may be times when such a \ncondition can affect a person\u2019s eligibly for a security clearance. \nIndividuals experience a range of reactions to traumatic events. For \nexample, the death of a loved one, divorce, major injury, service in a military \ncombat environment, sexual assault, domestic violence, or other difficult \nwork-related, family, personal, or medical issues may lead to grief, \ndepression, or other responses. The government recognizes that mental \nhealth counseling and treatment may provide important support for those \nwho have experience such events, as well as for those with other mental \nhealth conditions. Nothing in this questionnaire is intended to discourage \nthose who might benefit from such treatment from seeking it. \nMental health treatment and counseling, in and of itself, is not a reason to \nrevoke or deny eligibility for access to classified information or folding a \nsensitive position, suitability or fitness to obtain or retain Federal or contract \nemployment, or eligibility for physical or logical access to federally \ncontrolled facilities or information systems. Seeking or receiving mental \nhealth care for personal wellness and recovery may contribute favorably to \ndecisions about your eligibility. \nApplicant recognized and voluntarily sought mental health counseling when he and \nhis first wife were having marital difficulties and they separated. He was the care provider \nfor her daughter for four months, until unexpectedly the police took her away in November \n2017. He experienced grief and depression. Although there are indications that he had \nsuicidal ideations, I found him credible that he did not intend to commit suicide, but he \nwas depressed. He continued in therapy and sought counseling and assistance from Dr. \nMC. They mutually decided he could discontinue therapy. He has shown great insight in \nseeking mental health counseling when he knew he needed it. He was understandably \ndepressed. As noted by Dr. B in January 2022, his condition, major depressive disorder, \nis in remission. \nIt has been four years since Applicant\u2019s first wife passed away. He is happily\nmarried and looking forward to his future. In June 2023, LC administered assessments\nfor anxiety and depression. His scores were nonsignificant in the \u201cnone-minimal\u201d range.\nShe also reviewed the DSM-5 criteria for Bipolar I, II, and Major Depressive Disorder. Of \nthe three disorders, Applicant only \u201cendorsed 1 symptom of Major Depressive Disorder \n(diminished ability to concentrate/think) and the diagnosis requires 5 or more symptoms\nto be endorsed.\u201d In LC\u2019s professional opinion, Applicant does not currently meet the \ncriteria for Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar I or Bipolar II Disorders. I have \nconsidered Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis. I find Dr. MC and Applicant\u2019s mutual agreement that he no\n \n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlonger required therapy and LC\u2019s more recent evaluation and diagnosis as most \nprobative. I find the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the trustworthiness concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a trustworthiness concern and may \nbe disqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. \nApplicant was arrested in August 2017 and July 2018 on charges of domestic \nviolence. The charges were later dropped. In September 2018 and May 2019, Applicant\u2019s \nfirst wife filed a domestic violence restraining orders against him. The orders were later \ndropped. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying trustworthiness concerns based on the facts: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMinimally these domestic violence charges were the result of mutual arguments, \nand the police were called and arrested Applicant. I found Applicant credible that the \ncharges of domestic violence and a domestic violence restraining order were the result \nof his ex-wife attempting to gain leverage regarding their pending divorce. Her failure to \nappear on all of the charges raises questions about their validity. In any event, a \nsignificant period of time has elapsed, and it happened under unique circumstances that \nare unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana three times over a weekend in January 2018. He \npurchased it in his state where it is legal. He held a security clearance at the time but did \nnot have access to classified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) apply. AG \u00b6 25(f) does \nnot apply because Applicant did not have access to classified information and insufficient \nevidence was provided to conclude he held a sensitive position at the time. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed on his SF 86 that he purchased and used marijuana \nover a weekend in January 2018. He explained he used it because he hoped it would \nhelp him relieve stress from his marital issues. Marijuana is not illegal under state law in \nthe state where he lived. He said he was unaware that it was a violation of federal law but \nadmitted he should have known better. He acknowledged his mistake and took \nresponsibility for his conduct. Applicant self-reported this conduct, and it is likely no one \nwould ever have discovered it, had he not disclosed it, as required, on his SF 86. I believe \nthis conduct was uncharacteristic of Applicant. It has been more than five years since it \nhappened, it happened under unique circumstances, and it is unlikely to recur. He \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from future misuse of any illegal drug. I \nfind the above mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines I, H, and E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s commitment to ensuring his mental health is a priority is evident in his \nconsistent awareness and voluntary treatment. He went through a difficult period, and he \nis now in a better place emotionally and mentally. He has the support of his new wife and \nhis family. He has met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuideline I, psychological conditions, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline H, \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

Applicant was terminated from a job in early 2010 for showing up \nfor work intoxicated. He voluntarily admitted himself into this two-month outpatient \nprogram. He fully complied with the conditions of the program. Appellant started drinking \nalcohol when he was in his forties. He started drinking more heavily in the 2007 to 2010 \nperiod. In the outpatient program, he was diagnosed as alcohol dependent (Tr. at 15-16, \n28-29; GE 3 at 9, 25.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c September to October 2010 inpatient treatment for a condition \ndiagnosed as alcohol dependence. Applicant\u2019s marriage \u201cfell apart\u201d in 2010 when he and \nhis wife separated, and the stress following the breakup caused Applicant to relapse and \nstart drinking excessively again. He voluntarily admitted himself into a 30-day inpatient \ntreatment program. (Tr. at 16-17, 29-33; GE 1, Section 24.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d Between 2010 and June 2015, multiple periods of inpatient and \noutpatient treatment for a condition diagnosed as alcohol dependence. Applicant had \nperiods of sobriety after his 2010 inpatient treatment. The longest was about 18 months. \nHe had several relapses. Sometimes he voluntarily entered an inpatient treatment \nprogram for about seven days, and on other occasions he decided to pursue outpatient \ntreatment. He stated that he was not taking his condition seriously and did not realize that \nhe had crossed the line between being a social drinker into being an alcoholic. He did not \nappreciate the seriousness of the disease of alcoholism. Applicant and his wife divorced \nin January 2014. (Tr. at 17; 32-33; GE 1, Sections 17, 24.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e May 2014 arrest and charges with DUI and Failure to Stop after an \nAccident. Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Failure to Stop, as alleged in \nthe SOR. He denied, however, the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail. \nHe testified that after his arrest he was put in the \u201cdrunk tank\u201d overnight until he regained \nhis sobriety and then was released. The FBI report and the local sheriff\u2019s report in the \nrecord support the allegation that he was sentenced to four days in jail. He described the \nincident as a relapse and after drinking alcohol he drove to a store to buy groceries. He \nhad a minor accident and, due to the nature of the incident, he pulled his car into a parking \nspace to get his car off the road. The police treated his actions as a \u201chit and run.\u201d This \ncharge was eventually dropped. He testified that the accident was caused by the careless \ndriving of the other party involved, but Applicant took full responsibility for the accident \nbecause he was intoxicated. His BAC was 0.19%. He plead guilty to DUI and was \nsentenced to five years of probation.

Applicant testified that his depression \nwas not long-term, but rather was \u201cincidental to the alcohol.\u201d He was depressed by his \nliving conditions in a desert area that was not agreeable to him and his lingering negative \nfeelings following his divorce. He was experiencing stress related to his job and family \nsituation. His abuse of alcohol also acted as a depressant. He voluntarily entered into a \n30-day inpatient program. He testified that at this point, his longest period of sobriety was \nsixteen months, starting in January 2016 and ending in May 2017. He was discharged \nwith a diagnosis of Substance Abuse Disorder \u2013 Alcohol, Severe with a co-occurring \nmental disorder of Depression. He was given a guarded prognosis. After he left the \ntreatment facility in September 2017, he relocated to another city and lived in a shared \ncommunity home that was dedicated to alcohol-free living. He did well there until 2019 \nwhen he had a relapse and lost his job due to his failure to contact his supervisor and to \nshow up for work.

Applicant had a \u201cshort relapse\u201d in January 2021. He voluntarily \nchecked himself into an inpatient program. He was intoxicated at the time, and his BAC \nmeasured at 0.183%. He only intended to stay long enough to detox. The SOR allegation \nstated that he left the treatment facility before completing his Continuing Recovery \nDischarge Plan. He explained that was true, but his early departure from the program was \nthe result of a misunderstanding. Due to his intoxicated condition at the time he entered \nthe program, he did not understand that he was expected to remain at the facility for 30 \ndays. He could not stay there for more than a brief period because that would have kept \nhim away from his new job. He stayed for about five days; long enough, in his view, to \nsafely detox from his condition. The treatment facility\u2019s discharge summary lists \nApplicant\u2019s diagnosis on arrival was Alcohol Intoxication with moderate or severe use \ndisorder. The summary reflects that he made no progress in treatment and left the \nprogram before any planning could be done or any referrals provided. Applicant failed to \nlist this treatment in his February 5, 2021 e-QIP because he was tired of filling out the e-\nQIP and he felt that the treatment was not significant, rather it was just a \u201cquick detox.\u201d \n(Tr. at 19, 51-58, 66; GE 3 at 10; GE 6 at 1, 18.) \nThe last time Applicant drank alcohol was in July 2022.

He described his attendance at AA meetings prior to July 2022 as \u201cspotty.\u201d As \na result of his relapse, he was required to renew his sobriety date at AA. On May 26, \n2022, Applicant signed a statement \u201cunder penalty of perjury under the laws of the United \nStates that he intended to never drink alcohol again and never to drive after drinking.

Applicant did not separately respond to these allegations \nin his Answer. \nMitigation \nApplicant described his alcohol consumption, until he was about 45, as social.  He \nblames the beginning of his excessive drinking on his \u201cbad marriage.\u201d He was opposed \nto divorcing for religious reasons. Instead, he turned to alcohol. Applicant acknowledged \nthat he is an alcoholic. He now attends meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) most \nmornings, and he intends to continue to do so. He has a sponsor. Applicant believes that \nalcohol is a \u201ctricky disease,\u201d because it misleads you to believing that it is not a disease \nand is not a problem. It has taken him a long time to realize that he is an alcoholic and \nthat he needs to do whatever the AA program requires. He is actively involved in the AA \n12-step program. He is presently at Step 8. He intends to actively participate in AA for the \nrest of his life. He rents a room from an individual who is also in AA. They have an \nagreement that there will be no drinking of alcohol in the residence. Applicant explained \nthat he has now fully accepted his disease of alcoholism and treats his disease with AA \nand by seriously practicing his religious faith. He also receives counseling from the pastor \nat his church. He understands now that he can no longer turn to alcohol to help him deal \nwith stress in his life. After his last relapse he has a new sponsor. He speaks with the \nsponsor weekly. His prior sponsor lived too far from Applicant, and he recommended to \nApplicant that he should find a sponsor who lives near Applicant. (Tr. at 16-17, 19-24, 27, \n60-61; AE I.) \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor wrote in a character reference letter that he has known \nApplicant for about six years through their attendance at AA meetings. He praised \nApplicant for \u201creworking\u201d the 12 steps of AA. He commented that Applicant has held an \nadministrative position in his church and now has a similar position with a social club. \nApplicant also submitted four other character reference letters. His former sponsor, a \nformer neighbor, a former supervisor, and his church pastor all praised Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter and his dedication to maintaining sobriety. (AE C; AE I.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 lists six conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and  \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes all of the above disqualifying conditions, which \nshifts the burden of mitigation to Applicant. The following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23 have possible application: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been fully established. Applicant\u2019s \nalcohol abuse began in or about 2007, and he admittedly drank again as recently as July \n2022. It is too early to conclude that it will not recur. Accordingly, his behavior casts doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Applicant has acknowledged his disease \nof alcoholism and his lengthy pattern of alcohol abuse and relapses. He has also provided \nevidence of his actions to overcome this problem. He has committed to participating \nregularly if not daily in AA and has a local sponsor and his pastor to support him on a \nregular basis. He has not, however, demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations and his own understanding \nthat he cannot drink alcohol with relapses into alcohol abuse. \nApplicant has participated in counseling and treatment programs on multiple \noccasions. However, he has an extensive history of relapses. Moreover, insufficient time \nhas passed to establish that he is making sufficient progress in his AA program. Applicant \nhas completed several treatment programs, but he has not yet been able to maintain \nsobriety for any significant period of time. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel argued in his summation that Applicant\u2019s long history of \nsuccessfully holding a security clearance and his honesty at the hearing about his \nstruggle with alcoholism should be the measure by which his case is adjudicated rather \nthan the potentially disqualifying conditions set forth in the Directive, quoted above. In \nessence, counsel argued that the disqualifying conditions in Guideline G do not provide \nthe appropriate guidance for analyzing the potential security risks raised by Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of alcoholism. (Tr. at 73-78.) The Appeal Board, however, has rejected challenges \nto the Adjudicative Guidelines as inappropriate policy. The Board ruled that it, and \ntherefore DOHA administrative judges, lack the jurisdiction to reject the application of the \nDirective\u2019s guidelines in a particular case.

The Board commented that \ngiving an applicant special treatment not contemplated by Executive Order 10865 or the \nDirective \u201cwould have the practical effect of depriving other applicants of the fair, impartial \nand even-handed application of the law to which they are entitled.\u201d Id. It would indeed be \nunfair to not apply the disqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guideline G in this case \nin a fair, impartial and even-handed manner, just as those conditions are applied in every \nother case involving alcohol consumption under Guideline G. \nThe above precedents address and reject counsel\u2019s argument in favor of the \nrenewing Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. To the extent counsel overstated his \nargument and was merely seeking application of the whole-person concept as part of the \noverall considerations to be weighed, that issue is addressed below. \nApplicant has not carried his burden of mitigating the disqualifying security \nconcerns raised by the record evidence under Guideline G. Paragraph 1 is found against \nApplicant. \nParagraph 2 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 27, which states: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) does not apply because the behavior alleged is covered under another \nguideline, i.e., Guideline G. The other two potentially disqualifying conditions have some \napplication to the facts in this case, though the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior are more properly analyzed under Guideline G, as discussed above. In light of \nthe Government\u2019s election to proceed under Guideline I as well as Guideline G, I conclude \nthat the record evidence supports the application of AG \u00b6 28(c) and 28(d), which shifts \nthe burden of mitigation to Applicant. The following mitigating conditions are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 29: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;  \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have application in this case. largely for \nreasons similar to those set forth under Guideline G, above. Applicant has not carried his \nburden of mitigation under Guideline I. Paragraph 2 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G and Guideline I and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-\nperson analysis. For many years, Applicant has been in and out of treatment for his abuse \nof alcohol. It is only since his most recent relapse in July 2022 that he has concluded that \nhis use of alcohol was ruining his life, his health, and potentially his career. On May 26, \n2022, the day he answered the SOR, he made a written commitment to abstain from \nusing alcohol and expressed his understanding that \u201cany inappropriate involvement with \nalcohol use may be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d. Two months \nlater he did just that. I credit Applicant\u2019s years of holding a security clearance without a \nsecurity incident or violation. I also credit Applicant\u2019s honest statement that he truly \nintends to live soberly for the rest of his life. But as he acknowledges, his disease of \nalcoholism is \u201ctricky,\u201d and it has been very difficult for him to control it. He has not had a \nsufficient period of sobriety to evidence that he can successfully control his disease and \nlive an alcohol-free life. In the absence of evidence of a lengthy period of sobriety, I cannot \nconclude that he no longer presents a security risk under the Adjudicative Guidelines. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \npresent suitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

He has also failed to mitigate the and Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse) security concerns raised by his recent marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on February 26, 2021. \nOn April 27, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guidelines E and H. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended; and the adjudicative \nguidelines effective (AG) June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR requested a decision on the record without a hearing. \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case and on August 12, 2022, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmaterial (FORM), which included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4. Upon receipt of \nthe FORM, Applicant elected to retain counsel and requested that his case be converted \nto an in-person hearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel entered her appearance on September 6, \n2022, and reaffirmed Applicant\u2019s request for an in-person hearing. On September 8, 2022, \nDepartment Counsel submitted a memorandum to the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals\u2019 (DOHA) administrative department requesting that the FORM be converted to a \nhearing.  \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on September 12, 2022, and the case \nwas assigned to me on April 27, 2023. On June 21, 2023, DOHA notified Applicant that \nthe hearing was scheduled for July 20, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted into evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through G were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 27, 2023. \nProcedural Issue \nOn September 12, 2022, Department Counsel amended the SOR to include \u00b6 2.c, \nwhich alleges that Applicant falsified his October 2019 e-QIP by failing disclose his \nmarijuana use within the past seven years. The amended SOR required Applicant to circle \neither \u201cadmit\u201d or \u201cdeny\u201d and initial beside his response. Applicant circled \u201cadmit.\u201d He also \nattached a response to the SOR and the amended SOR wherein he admitted the three \nGuideline E falsification allegations but denied that his failure to disclose the information \nwas intentional. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from approximately May 2016 to December 2018 and that he used marijuana \nin about October 2020 while granted access to classified information. He admits each of \nthese allegations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his February 26, 2021, \ne-QIP by intentionally failing to disclose his marijuana use in about October 2020; by \nintentionally failing to disclose his 2020 marijuana while possessing a security clearance; \nand that he falsified his October 1, 2019, e-QIP by intentionally failing to disclose his \nmarijuana use from approximately May 2016 to December 2018. \nApplicant, 26, is a senior information technology consultant currently employed by \na defense contractor since November 2019. He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in May \n2019. (GX 3.)   \nApplicant completed his first e-QIP in 2019. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that \nasked if he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substances in the last seven years. \nHe was granted a secret security clearance in November 2019. (GX 3; GX 4.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn his February 2021 e-QIP in response to the same question about his drug use \nin the last seven years, Applicant stated that he used THC (marijuana) \u201cless than three \ntimes in college\u201d and listed his dates of use as May 2016 (estimated) to December 2018. \nWhen asked to provide an explanation of why he did not intend to use marijuana in the \nfuture, Applicant stated \u201cI will/have not been using this drug prior to my initial employment \ndue to security clearance regulations that THC is an illegal substance per governmental \nlaw.\u201d (GX 1.) \nOn March 23, 2021, Applicant underwent a personal subject interview (PSI) as part \nof his background investigation. He verified the investigator\u2019s summary of the interview in \nresponse to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories on April 6, 2022. During his PSI, Applicant told the \ninvestigator the information on his February 2021 e-QIP was accurate except that he also \nused marijuana one more time in October 2020 while possessing a security clearance. \nHe stated that he did not know why he did not list this most recent use. He then stated he \n\u201cdid not report this most recent use to his organization because he did not know what the \nrepercussions would have on his job status.\u201d He further stated that he \u201cwasn\u2019t told what \nthe reporting requirements were and was therefore not sure if he would be required to \nreport his use to his organization.\u201d (GX 2.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his answer to the amended SOR, Applicant stated: \nIn 2019, I completed an e-QIP for my first professional job. It was the first \ntime I had applied for a security clearance. I did not disclose that I had used \nmarijuana between 2016 and 2018. . . . I blame my own omission on my \nignorance of the process as well as my failure to pay attention to detail when \ncompleting such forms. At the time, I did not fully understand the significant \nconsequences my actions could have on my future and my ability to \nprogress in my chosen field. I did not receive an in-brief at my new job \nexplaining the e-QIP process and the pitfalls. \nFrom 2016 to 2018, I was in my first few years of college, and I used \nmarijuana with friends. I was young and immature and not thinking about \nhow my decisions could negatively impact my future. The use was \ninfrequent and never resulted in anyone questioning my judgment, \ncharacter, or reliability. \nApplicant further stated, \u201cthe 2020 use was an outlier and not consistent with my \nbehavior and 2020.\u201d \nI was put in for a higher level fill out another e-QIP when I completed the e-\nQIP on February 26, 2021, I unintentionally omitted my use of marijuana in \nOctober 2020. . . . During my interview with the investigator, I realized I had \nomitted the 2020 use when completing the e-QIP and I reported it. I did so \nbecause my failure to include the information on the form was an oversight. \nIt was not intentional. . . . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated: \nAnd when it came to the marijuana section, I mean at the time I was right \nout of college, I was scared if I were to say yes or no. What does that mean \nif I were to get rejected? That\u2019s a huge impact on my job, right. So I think \nnot understanding the process and being truthful in your answers, no matter \nwhat that is if it\u2019s going to negatively impact you are not a thing that\u2019s really \nthe main thing. (Tr. 23.) \n \nSo during the time, so my interview, if I recall, was back in 2021. And during \nthe time, I was answering all the questions\u2026 And she asked if I recall doing \nmarijuana. Have I ever done it? And I was, like, yes. I have done it in 2016 \nand 2018, throughout college, very briefly, periodically. I was, again, I was \na college student. . . . I was very busy all the time, but I say I maybe did it \ntwice a year. (Tr. 24.) \n \nSo that\u2019s something that I, looking back on, if I were to go and resubmit the \nform again, no matter what I\u2019ve done, parking tickets, if I\u2019ve gotten arrested, \nyou have to put it on there. You can\u2019t lie about that. Because there\u2019s always \nways to find that out, whether it\u2019s in the court or if there sifting through your \nfriends. There\u2019s always ways to find things. So I think it\u2019s just the right thing \nto do, is just be honest and truthful. (Tr. 25.) \nDuring cross-examination, the following exchange occurred: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: When you completed your first e-QIP in October of \n2019, you did not disclose your marijuana use while in college. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And you\u2019re saying it\u2019s because you breezed \nthrough the form and missed the questions about that? \nAPPLICANT: Breezed through the form and then just being nervous about \nsubmitting the, well, if I were to say yes, I had smoked marijuana from 2016 \nto 2018 when I graduated, I would be scared of that. That was going to \nimpact my ability to obviously move from [my former state of residence], and \nstart a new life, and working in this field, so yes. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Okay. So you chose not to include that \ninformation, because you were concerned it would affect your chances of \ngetting a job? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. (Tr. 39.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nWhile holding a security clearance, Applicant used marijuana in October 2020 \nwhile attending a party: \nAPPLICANT\u2019S ATTORNEY: So even at the party, did you realize how stupid \nyou were? \nAPPLICANT: Yes. So admittedly I took a couple of hits of it, and I \nimmediately realized \u2013 and I jumped, what are you doing? Why are you\ndoing this? So I immediately removed myself from the situation. There was\n[sic] people that were around me that they were mutual friends or friends of \nfriends. And I was, like, why am I doing this? Like, if I were to get caught, or\nif somebody were to find out about this, that\u2019s not good. (Tr. 26.) \n \n \n \n \nWhen asked by Department Counsel if he was aware that holding a security \nclearance meant that he could not use marijuana or other illegal substances, Applicant \nstated, \u201cI  did understand that, to be honest, at the time. I did.\u201d (Tr. 42.)  \nThe following exchange regarding Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose his October 2020 \nmarijuana use while holding a security clearance on his 2021 e-QIP occurred during \ncross-examination: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And this form was filled out February 2021. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Approximately four months after you used \nmarijuana at the party. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: You did not list that marijuana use on this form. \nWhy not? \nAPPLICANT: Again, I\u2019d say it\u2019s negligence, the process, and being afraid of \nwhat the ramifications would be if I were to say yes on this occurrence in \nOctober that I did use marijuana for -- I did use marijuana.  \nSo again, like I\u2019ve said before, being not mature to the process, not \nunderstanding the ramifications I would have behind that if I were to submit \nfictitious or false information, or hide the information, what it would have on \nmy career. \nSo going back, if I were to go back, if I had the ability, I would say yes, \nabsolutely, I did do that. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBecause again, I think with the maturity and where I\u2019m at now in \nunderstanding the process, that is my due diligence, and that\u2019s the right \nthing to do. But that\u2019s my response, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So just so you understand, we want to know if \nyour omission of that fact was deliberate or intentional. And it sounds like it \nwas deliberate that you, on purpose left that information off of this form. Is \nthat correct? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So your claims of making mistakes, or being \nnegligent in filling out this form, aren't really accurate, then. \nAPPLICANT: I wouldn\u2019t say that. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Well, we discussed earlier, the first form you \nfilled out, the first clearance you filled out, you didn\u2019t list the information \nabout your college drug use, because you were afraid you would get the \nclearance. Is that right? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And then the second form you filled out, you \ndidn\u2019t list the fact that you used marijuana at a party while holding a \nclearance, because you were afraid of the consequences. \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Is that right? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir. That\u2019s correct. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So it was a willful omission, it wasn\u2019t just \nnegligence. Is that correct? \nAPPLICANT: No. It was willful, but to be honest, that\u2019s something I honestly \neven buried, because I wasn\u2019t there for an extended use of time using \nmarijuana. I literally, I buried it. And is that the right thing to do? No, of \ncourse not. But was it intentional to leave it off there, to answer your \nquestion, yes, I did intentionally leave it off there, off the form. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: And do you understand why that\u2019s more \nsignificant to us than using marijuana three times in college? \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAPPLICANT: Yeah, absolutely. Because, I mean, while having a clearance, \nand if you\u2019re going to lie about that, I mean, that doesn\u2019t show\ntrustworthiness and that somebody who holds a clearance, like, what else\nam I going to lie about, right? So trust me, I completely understand that\nprocess now. So, yes, I understand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: So why should we believe you now? \nAPPLICANT: Again, this is something that I have -- this has been sitting on \nme for over a year now, since this has gone down. And I think it goes back \nto my maturity of understanding the process and having more \nresponsibilities now.

But I did not. And that was just due to being afraid of the \nramifications and what\u2019s going to happen after that. So that\u2019s it. (Tr. 47-50.) \nApplicant stated in his PSI, in his answer to the amended SOR, and during his \ntestimony that he does not associate with people who use illegal drugs. (GX 2; Tr. 27.) \nApplicant started college in 2016 at a private then-college now university, in his \nhome state. In describing his college background during direct examination, Applicant \nstated:  \nBut, yeah, so during that four years, I played baseball in college. I took \naround 18 to 21 credit hours a semester because, obviously baseball, it\u2019s \nlike a full-time job itself. And then also I did have a full-time job to provide\nfor myself as well, because obviously being in college, I mean, I never got \na handout, right. (Tr. 15-16.) \n \nWhen asked by his attorney what year he graduated, Applicant stated, \n\u201c2019, May 2019.\u201d (Tr. 16.) \nThe following exchange occurred during cross-examination: \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: What was your GPA [in college]? \nAPPLICANT: So my graduate GPA, I believe, was 3.5, 3.5 or 3.6. \nDEPARTMENT COUNSEL: Did you maintain a 3.5 GPA while playing \nbaseball all four years? \nAPPLICANT: Yes, sir.

Under the heading \u201cEDUCATION\u201d \nin the summary of Applicant\u2019s March 2021 PSI, it states that Applicant volunteered that \nhe attended the university he listed on his e-QIPs from August 2015 until May 2019, \u201cbut \nwas issued the bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2020.\u201d He told the investigator that he \nwas not sure why he listed this information incorrectly on his e-QIP. (GX 3; GX 1; GX 3.) \nUnder the heading \u201cDEVELOPED EDUCATION,\u201d the PSI summary states that \nApplicant volunteered that from June 2019 until December 2020 he attended an online\nuniversity. Applicant explained that he did not know why he did not list the additional \nuniversity. He explained that he took courses at the online university because they were \nless expensive. He then transferred the credits to his original University which issued his\nbachelor\u2019s degree. He completed his coursework online while working for his current \nemployer.

I understand that a knowing and willful false statement on \nthis form can be punished by a fine or imprisonment or both (18 U.S.C. \n1001).

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable, and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7.

The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

He simply cannot keep his story \nstraight. In his answer to the amended SOR, he stated that his omissions on both e-QIPs \nwere unintentional. He attributed his omissions on his 2019 e-QIP to his \u201cignorance of the \nimportance of the process\u201d and his \u201cfailure to pay attention to detail when completing such \nforms.\u201d \nHowever, in his testimony, Applicant stated that he intentionally failed to list his \n2016 to 2018 marijuana use on his 2019 e-QIP because he was afraid that he would not \nget the job for which he was applying. \nIn his answer to the amended SOR, Applicant stated that he unintentionally omitted \nhis October 2020 marijuana use while holding the security clearance on his February \n2021 e-QIP, emphasizing that his failure to include the information was an \u201coversight\u201d and \n\u201cnot intentional.\u201d \nDuring his March 2021 PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he did not know \nwhy he failed to list his 2020 marijuana use on his e-QIP, but stated that he did not report \nthe use to his organization because he was concerned that it could have an impact on his \nemployment status. \nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated he lied on his 2021 e-QIP about using \nmarijuana while holding a clearance because he was scared about what would happen \nwith his job. \nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s statements regarding the frequency of his marijuana use \nfrom 2016 to 2018 are inconsistent. On his 2021 e-QIP, he stated that he used marijuana \nin college less than three times. Less than three times definitionally means one or two \ntimes. However, during his testimony, he said that for the three years he used marijuana \nin college, he used it once or twice a year. He then stated that he used marijuana a total \nof three times in college. \nApplicant\u2019s various statements about his October 2020 marijuana use while \nholding a security clearance and the reason for his failure to report it on his 2021 e-QIP \nare inconsistent and overall implausible. He asserted that the omission was an oversight \nand unintentional. He also stated that he had suppressed the memory of this incident and \ndid not remember it until his PSI in March 2021. I find this assertion to be unconvincing. \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s repeated inability to unequivocally state the frequency of his \nmarijuana use throughout the security clearance process raises doubts about his \ncredibility and candor. I find it implausible that Applicant used marijuana a total of four \ntimes in his life and cannot recall at least some of the details of each of the circumstances \nand arrive at an accurate count. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant made multiple references to his unfamiliarity with the security clearance \nprocess and lack of understanding of the potential impact that intentionally falsifying his \nresponses on a security clearance application could have on his ability to obtain or \nmaintain a security clearance. First, telling the truth is a fundamental tenet of our society\u2019s \ngeneral ethical framework. As a general rule, it is not acceptable to lie. After falsifying \nmaterial facts on his first e-QIP in October 2019, Applicant signed the document, thereby \ncertifying that his responses were true to the best of his knowledge under penalty of \nFederal law. The ramifications for intentionally providing false information on the e-QIP \nare set forth above the signature line in plain English. At his next opportunity to provide \nthe Government with accurate information for assessing his security worthiness, he opted \nto lie again. \nThroughout the security clearance adjudication process, Applicant failed to fully \naccept responsibility for his conduct. He first attributed his failure to tell the truth on not \npaying attention when completing the e-QIP and on his lack of understanding of the \nsecurity clearance process. When he ultimately admitted to intentionally falsifying his \nresponses in 2019 and 2021, he stated that he lied because he was concerned about the \nimpact his conduct would have on his career path. \nApplicant also made several statements while testifying that raise concerns about \nhis credibility and trustworthiness. He stated that he graduated from his original university \nin May 2019 and that he played baseball for the four years he attended that school. This \nis not what he told the investigator during his PSI and it is not the information that he \nprovided on his 2019 and 2021 e-QIPs. \nApplicant also stated that if he had it all to do over again, he would list any and all \nderogatory information as required on the e-QIP, regardless of whether he had parking \ntickets or had gotten arrested, stating, \u201cYou can\u2019t lie about that. \u201cBecause there\u2019s always \nways to find that out. . . .\u201d In describing the circumstances of his October 2020 marijuana \nuse and his recognition of his poor judgment at the time of use, his stated concerns were \nabout whether or not someone saw him using marijuana or if he got caught doing it. He \ndoes not demonstrate an understanding of his obligation to be honest and forthcoming \nand to conduct himself in a manner consistent with those granted access to classified or \nsensitive information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. None of the mitigating conditions \napply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by the record evidence, establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment were drugs were used; \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \n\u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed on notice of its security \nsignificance, such as using after having completed a clearance application, may be \nlacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines H and E and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nconduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n15 \n",

He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since he \nwas in the military. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and a master\u2019s degree in \n2022. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17, 49; GE 1, 9; \nAE B, E, F) \nApplicant has a history of substance abuse, alcohol-related incidents, and \ncriminal conduct. On several occasions between about July 2010 and January 2011, he \nused synthetic marijuana, commonly known as \u201cspice.\u201d It appears that the substance \nwas not on the schedule of controlled substances at the time, but the military prohibited \nthe use of any substance, other than alcohol or tobacco, for the purpose of altering \nmood or function.

The forfeiture was \nsuspended. In May 2011, he was discharged for misconduct (drug abuse) with a \ngeneral under honorable conditions discharge. (Tr. at 24-29, 49-50; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 8, 9; AE F) \nApplicant testified that he consulted with an attorney before his Article 15 \npunishment and discharge. He stated that he \u201cwas under the impression that had [he] \nelected to talk to an attorney that it would have went down to a court. And [he] would not \nhave been able to get the general discharge.\u201d When he was informed that he initialed \nthe record of nonjudicial punishment proceedings indicating that he had consulted with \na lawyer, he stated that he did not recall seeing a judge advocate. (Tr. at 28-29; GE 8) \nApplicant was arrested in State A in December 2013 and charged with driving \nunder the influence (DUI). The police report indicates that Applicant was drinking in a \nbar/restaurant, when he was refused further alcohol service because he was \nintoxicated. The business called a taxi, but he did not accept the taxi. The manager told \nApplicant that if he attempted to drive, the manager would call the police.

He \nrefused to participate in a field sobriety test, and he refused to provide a breath or blood \nsample. (Tr. at 30-32, 51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7) \nApplicant pleaded guilty or no contest. He may have received deferred \nsentencing in which he paid a fine and court costs, and he was on unsupervised \nprobation for a year. He testified that he did not have a good memory of what led to his \narrest, and he did not recall if he was intoxicated when he left the bar. (Tr. at 30-33, 51-\n53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7, 9) \nApplicant was arrested in March 2014 in State B and charged with public \ndrunkenness. He pleaded guilty and paid a fine of about $500. He does not remember \nmany details of what occurred other than it was outside his home. (Tr. at 33-36, 55-58; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6, 9) \nApplicant was drinking at a bar/restaurant in State C in March 2016. The staff \noffered him options for a safe ride home, but he refused. The staff called the police and \nreported that Applicant left the establishment, was possibly intoxicated, and intended to \ndrive home. The police arrived, and the staff pointed out Applicant, who was not far from \nhis car. The police officer noted clear signs that Applicant was intoxicated, and he was \nshoeless with mud around his legs up to his knees. There is a lake near the restaurant, \nand the officer deduced that Applicant walked into the lake despite the temperature \nbeing about 44 degrees. Applicant told the officer he was walking home, but he was \nwalking in the wrong direction. He stated that he did not have his car keys, but they \nwere found in his pocket. (Tr. at 37-40, 59-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 9) \nApplicant was arrested for the above incident and charged with public \nintoxication. He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and paid a fine of about $500. \n(Tr. at 37-39, 59-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5, 9) \nApplicant provided inconsistent testimony about the incident. He initially testified: \nI went to another bar late at night alone, by myself. And I drank too much, \nto excess. And I didn\u2019t want to drive home because I knew I had too much \nto drink so I attempted to walk home.  \nThis is when the officer, officer stopped me when I was walking home. He \nperformed a field sobriety test and determined I was intoxicated in public. \n(Tr. at 37) \nTwo questions later, he answered that he could not recall if he was intoxicated when he \nleft the restaurant. He also stated that he could not recall if he walked in the lake.

At least one person \ncalled the police at about 0210 and reported that a car hit a curb, and the driver \n(Applicant) was standing in the middle of the street and appeared to be intoxicated. \nApplicant was extremely intoxicated. His blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was \nmeasured at .279%. (Tr. at 40-41, 61-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 9) \nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) with a \nblood alcohol concentration (BAC) of .15% or greater. In February 2017, he pleaded \nguilty to the lesser charge of DWI. He was sentenced to fines and court fees of $1,600, \nconfinement in the county jail for 180 days (suspended for 180 days), and probation for \none year. Applicant stated that he thought it was a deferred adjudication, but there is \nnothing in the court records to corroborate that assertion. (Tr. at 40-41, 61-63; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 9) \nIn January 2020, police responded to a report that two individuals were fighting in \nthe parking lot of a bar in State C at about 2346. Applicant was found on the ground. \nThe other individual (described by Applicant as an acquaintance) forcibly stopped \nApplicant from driving home. Applicant admitted to the police officer that he had \u201ca lot\u201d \nto drink, he was intoxicated, and he planned to drive home until he was stopped by the \nother individual. Applicant admitted in his response to the SOR that he was drinking that \nnight, but he \u201cwas not binge drinking or drinking to excess.\u201d (Tr. at 42-44, 65-67; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 9) \nApplicant was arrested for the above incident and charged with public \nintoxication. He pleaded no contest or guilty to the charge and paid a fine of about $350. \nHe has little memory of the incident. (Tr. at 42-44, 65-67; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nGE 2, 9) \nApplicant admitted that he had drinking issues, but he does not believe he is an \nalcoholic, and he does not believe that he currently has a drinking problem. He stated \nthat, except for his use of spice in the military, he has never used illegal drugs. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he indicated that \u201cit was in his best interest to refrain from alcohol \nconsumption entirely.\u201d He signed a statement of intent in August 2022 stating that he \ndiscontinued drinking, and that he intended \u201cto abstain from alcohol use in the future.\u201d \nHe has maintained his \u201csobriety,\u201d which he described as not drinking to intoxication, for \nmore than a year. The last time he had anything to drink was in May 2023 when he had \nthree beers with his father at a baseball game. He is fitness oriented and goes to the \ngym about five times a week. He is attending graduate school in pursuit of another \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Tr. at 18-21, 27, 46-51, 69-73; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE A, I, \nJ, L-P) \nI did not find Applicant credible. I find that the reports into his conduct are more \nreliable than Applicant, and that he committed the conduct alleged in the reports. \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI or DWI in 2013 and 2017. He was arrested or \ncited for public drunkenness or public intoxication in 2014, 2016, and February 2020. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a troubled history with alcohol. He has two alcohol-related driving \noffenses. He refused assistance from his friend and the staff at the bar on two other \noccasions, and apparently would have driven if not arrested by the police. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he indicated that \u201cit was in his best interest to refrain from alcohol \nconsumption entirely.\u201d He signed a statement of intent in August 2022 stating that he \ndiscontinued drinking, and that he intended \u201cto abstain from alcohol use in the future.\u201d \nHe testified that he has maintained his \u201csobriety,\u201d which he described as not drinking to \nintoxication, for more than a year. The last time he had anything to drink was in May \n2023 when he had three beers with his father at a baseball game. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated misconduct is serious. It would be difficult to find it mitigated even if I believed \nhim. I do not. \nI have concerns about Applicant\u2019s drinking and the extremely poor judgment he \nexhibited while drinking. None of the mitigating conditions are sufficiently applicable to \novercome concerns about Applicant\u2019s alcohol use, reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nand honesty. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used synthetic marijuana, commonly known as \u201cspice,\u201d in about 2010. \nIt appears that the substance was not on the schedule of controlled substances at the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \ntime, but the military prohibited the use of any substance, other than alcohol or tobacco. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nApplicant held a security clearance at the time, but I do not find substantial \nevidence that the use was while granted access to classified information. AG \u00b6 25(g) is \nnot applicable. See ISCR Case No. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) for a \ndiscussion on the distinction between holding a security clearance and having access to \nclassified information. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThis was Applicant\u2019s only drug involvement and it occurred more than 12 years \nago. I find that he has abstained from illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and that \nillegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related arrests. SOR \u00b6 2.b alleges \nthat he was separated from the military \u201cfor misconduct (drug abuse),\u201d and his \u201cservice \nwas characterized as General, Under Honorable Conditions.\u201d His discharge does not \nraise any criminal conduct disqualifying conditions, but his illegal drug abuse does. AG \n\u00b6 31(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe analysis under alcohol consumption applies equally here. While I found his \ndrug abuse mitigated under Guideline H because I do not believe he will use illegal \ndrugs again, it falls into his pattern of substance abuse and disregard for the law. \nAdditionally, I do not believe his testimony. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct, including his \nillegal drug abuse, continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above \nmitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns under Guideline H, but he did not mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guidelines G and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 26, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on July 5, 2022, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on April 28, 2023. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice on May 5, 2023, \nscheduling the matter for a video teleconference (VTC) hearing on June 13, 2023.  \nI convened the hearing as scheduled.

He is 42 years old, married, and he \nhas four children, only one of whom is a minor. He graduated from high school in 2008 \nand attended some college but did not earn a degree. He has owned his home since \nDecember 2021. (Answer; Tr. at 6, 23-24, 49; GE 1) \nApplicant has worked primarily as a shipfitter for various DOD contractors since \napproximately 2008. He was unemployed from January 2016 to May 2016 and May to\nJune 2017, due to layoffs because of a lack of work. He has worked as a general foreman \nfor his current employer since March 2020. He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. \nat 5, 7-9, 24-32; GE 1-2)  \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 3 delinquent consumer debts, totaling \n$61,858. SOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card in collection for $15,922, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c are \ncharged-off credit cards for $29,740 and $16,196, respectively. The SOR allegations are \nestablished by his admissions in his Answer; his June 2020 security clearance application \n(SCA); his July 2021 response to financial interrogatories; and credit bureau reports from \nAugust 2020 and March 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 24-32; GE 1-4)  \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to his periods of unemployment and \nminimal income. In around 2007, he used the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c to pay for \n$40,000 of training to be a real estate investor. The training taught him \u201chow to flip \nproperties and buy and hold wholesale . . . .\u201d He made monthly payments on the credit \ncards until he became unemployed. He also used the credit cards to pay for his family\u2019s  \ndaily living expenses when he was unemployed. During his periods of unemployment, his \nspouse also worked only part time. (Tr. at 24-32, 35-39, 44-47; GE 1-2) \nApplicant contacted each of the creditors when he lost his job in 2016. He \nattempted to lower his monthly payments until he was re-employed, but the creditors \ndenied his request. When the creditors later offered him lower monthly payments, he was \nstill unemployed. When employed, he earned approximately $50,000 annually from 2012 \nto 2017; $70,000 annually from 2017 to 2019; $55,000 annually from 2019 to 2020; and \n$87,000 annually since March 2020. His spouse, who has worked full time as a dental \nhygienist since 2018, earned $60,000 annually. (Tr. at 24-32, 35-39, 44-46, 52-54; GE 1-\n2) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not made any payments toward the \nSOR debts. He had to pay for two other credit cards, and he also paid approximately \n$15,000 total in taxes to the IRS from around 2017 to 2020. As of the date of the hearing, \nhe did not owe delinquent taxes to the IRS. He and his spouse also took out two loans in \n2021, totaling $38,000, to renovate their home.

(Tr. at 49-52; GE 2, 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(c) are \nestablished. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his debts. The first prong of \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under his circumstances. While Applicant intends to resolve the \nSOR debts, he had not yet taken any steps toward doing so as of the date of the hearing. \nHe has not received financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has \nhis finances under control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

A security investigator questioned Applicant about several incidents recited in \na memorandum recommending that she be discharged. (GX 2) The memorandum was \nnot included in the record, but the investigator\u2019s questioning reflects the following \nincidents: \nFirst, Applicant was punished by her company commander for multiple military \nviolations, such as being late for duty, missing formations, and wearing improper insignia \non her uniform. \nSecond, Applicant was accused of impersonating a noncommisioned officer. She \nwas talking with a loan officer about an overdue payment, and she gave her platoon \nsergeant\u2019s name as a person who could verify that she was late making the payment \nbecause she was sick. When the loan officer called again, she thought she was talking to \nthe platoon sergeant. No disciplinary action was imposed for this incident, but it was \nincluded in the list of incidents recited as a basis for discharging Applicant from the Army. \nThird, Applicant was involved in the use of a rental car that resulted in her being \ncharged with wrongful appropriation of the car and making a false official statement. \nAccording to the law enforcement report, a former sergeant had rented a vehicle in May \n2015, and he left the vehicle with Applicant when he was separated from the Army. The \nrisk manager for the car rental agency told law enforcement authorities that she had \ncontacted Applicant several times and that Applicant had agreed to return the vehicle. \nThe rental agency they reported the vehicle as stolen when it was not returned. Applicant \nclaimed that she gave the former sergeant money to extend the rental period, but he \ndenied receiving any money from her. She knew that the return of the vehicle was overdue \nby about five weeks, but she denied being contacted by the rental agency. She told the \nlaw enforcement investigators that her cellphone was not working and that she did not \nreceive any email from the rental agency.

Applicant testified that she did not disclose the April \n2012 marijuana incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a because she had been told that it would be \nexpunged. She denied intentionally falsifying her SCA or intentionally failing to disclose \ninformation to the security investigator, but she admitted that she was careless when she \ndid not fully disclose the basis of her discharge from the Army. (Tr. 64-65.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d).

Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. The delinquent car loan was the result of \nfraudulent conduct, which was a condition largely beyond her control. Her marital \nseparation was largely beyond her control. Her unemployment was not largely beyond \nher control, but was due to her repeated misconduct. She has acted responsibly regarding \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d and 1.j, which she has resolved. She has not acted \nresponsibly regarding the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, for which she has negotiated a \nsettlement but has not made any payments. She claimed that she settled the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.j, but she submitted no evidence supporting her claim. She \nsubmitted no evidence of responsible conduct regarding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, \n1.g, and 1.h. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established, because Applicant sought and received \nfinancial counseling at a family assistance center at the military installation where she \nwas employed. However, she has not yet reached the point where there are \u201cclear \nindications\u201d that the financial problems are being resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.d and 1.j. It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and 1.j, because she has not submitted \nany evidence supporting her claim that these debts were resolved. When an applicant \nclaims that a debt is resolved, he or she is expected to present documentary evidence \nsupporting that claim. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). This \nmitigating condition is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, \nbecause Applicant admitted that she had done nothing to resolve these debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and \ncandid answers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \nAG \u00b616(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations. \nAG \u00b6 16(a) is established for Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose that she had been \ncharged with possession of marijuana in April 2012.

See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd.

Applicant did not correct the omissions until she was \nconfronted with the facts. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s arrest for possession of marijuana in April \n2012, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. which is mitigated by the passage of time without recurrence. \nIt is not established for the military disciplinary offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b or the \nfraudulent conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. The offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b are almost \nten years old, but they were the beginning of a long record of inability or unwillingness to \nfollow rules and regulations that continued until Applicant was discharged from the Army. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established for the falsifications during the security-clearance \nadjudication process, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d-2.f, because they are not \u201cminor.\u201d The \ngovernment has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified \ninformation. That compelling interest includes the government's legitimate interest in \nbeing able to make sound decisions, based on complete and accurate information, about \nwho will be granted access to classified information. An applicant who deliberately fails \nto give full, frank, and candid answers to the government in connection with a security \nclearance investigation or adjudication interferes with the integrity of the industrial security \nprogram.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under those guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by her delinquent debts and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct) \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n04/13/2023 \nDecision \nWESLEY, ROGER C. Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate the financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 5, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) \nConsolidated Central Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations guideline \nthe DoD could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for \ngranting a security clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) \n(Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                 \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (undated), and requested a hearing. This case \nwas assigned to me on December 20, 2022. A hearing was scheduled for February 21, \n2023, via Microsoft Teams Teleconference Services, and was heard on the scheduled \ndate. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits. (GEs 1-4) \nApplicant relied on one witness (himself) and nine exhibits. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on March 2, 2023. \n Summary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F of the SOR, Applicant allegedly (a) misused his company \ncredit card in September 2018 for personal use, was confronted by his employer with \nallegations of misconduct, and left by mutual agreement and (b) accumulated 13 \ndelinquent consumer debts exceeding $61,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been \nresolved. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted (a) some of the alleged SOR \ndebts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.d, 1.g, and 1.m-1.n) with explanations. He claimed he misused \nhis company credit card to include his family members on a company business trip and \nwas not allowed to repay the expenditures before leaving his employment by personal \nagreement. He also claimed he could not pay his listed consumer debts for lack of \nmoney after losing his job. \nAddressing his student loan debts, he claimed he became unable to continue \npaying on his student loan accounts after he lost his job in 2018. He further claimed his \nDepartment of Education (DoE) loans are currently in deferment and attached a credit \nreport. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference. Additional \nfindings of fact follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in May 2010 and has three children from this marriage (ages \nsix, eight, and nine). (GE 1; Tr. 28) He earned a high school diploma in May 2006. He \nearned an associates degree in May 2008 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2014. \n(GE 1) He reported no military service, and he has never held a security clearance. \nSince August 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nfull-time shop mechanic. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 25-27) Between September 2012 and September \n2018, he worked for a railroad as a truck driver mechanic. This job required a \nconsiderable amount of travel, and he left this job by mutual agreement in September \n2018.

(GEs 2-4) Included SOR debts are as follows: \n1.b (a co-signed delinquent auto loan for $16,228); 1.c, 1.e-1.f,  and 1.h-1.l (delinquent \nstudent loans exceeding $18,000); 1.d (a delinquent credit card debt for $5,611); 1.g (a \ndelinquent consumer debt for $2,124); 1.m (a delinquent utility debt for $118); and 1.n \n(a delinquent car loan for $21,111). Applicant attributed these debts to insufficient \nresources to address his debts following his separation from his job in September 2018.  \nBefore he was forced to leave his railroad job by mutual agreement in 2018, \nApplicant was charged with using his company credit card to purchase a hotel room for \nhis wife and family. (GEs 1-2\u2019 Tr. 31) Having invited his wife and family to accompany \nhim on a business trip, he booked a hotel upgrade to accommodate his wife and family \nand used his company travel card to rent the hotel room for the July 4th  weekend. (GEs \n1-2; Tr. 28-31)  \nOnce Applicant\u2019s company learned of his using his company travel card to \naccommodate his family while on company travel, it opened an internal investigation \ninto the matter. (GEs 1-2) After confirming the facts of the reported incident, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer came to an agreement with him in September 2018 to separate from the \ncompany by mutual agreement. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 28-29, 32) Applicant\u2019s offer to repay the \nmoney he used to obtain an upgrade of his hotel room was declined by his employer. \n(GE 2; Tr. 29) \nWithout comparable income to address his accrued debts following his \nunplanned 2018 employment separation, Applicant encountered difficulties paying his \ndebts and was unable to prevent his defaulting on them. Two of the delinquent debts \ninvolved deficient balances on vehicles purchased in 2020. Both of these accounts \nremain unpaid and unresolved. (Tr. 33-34, 41-42) \nOther delinquent accounts belonging to Applicant include his DoE student debts \n(opened between 2010 and 2014). While these delinquent loans have been in \ndeferment for the past two years, they were in delinquent status before they were \nplaced in deferment. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 50-51) Records document eight separate student \nloans that were placed in collection in October 2020 prior to being placed in deferment \nstatus. (GE 2) After losing his job, Applicant became unable to continue making his \nscheduled monthly payments. \nApplicant\u2019s remaining creditors have not been addressed with any documented \npayments. SOR creditor 1.d obtained a stipulated judgment against Applicant in August \n2022 in the amount of $6,052. (AE D) As a part of Applicant\u2019s settlement agreement \nwith the creditor to forebear collection on the judgment, Applicant agreed to make \nmonthly payments of $52.86, beginning in August 2022. (AE E) Agreed monthly \npayments in compliance with his settlement agreement are not documented, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges no more than $500 in payments have been paid to date on this \naccount. (AEs C-E; Tr. 36) \nNeither of his three delinquent accounts with SOR creditors 1.b, 1.g, and 1.n \nhave been addressed, and they remain unresolved and outstanding. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 39-\n42)   Although his agreement with SOR creditor 1.m to pay off the $118 utility debt owed \nto this creditor\u2019s collection agent is not documented, Applicant\u2019s payment assurances \nconcerning this small debt are credible, corroborated in part by its deletion from his  \nmost recent credit report, and are accepted. (AE H; Tr. 40)  \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation remains poor. (GE 2) To date, he has been limited \nin his ability to manage his debts, and he has not had the monetary resources to \naddress his delinquent accounts. (GE 2) His current plans consist of saving up enough \nmoney to pay off his debts. (GE 2; Tr. 25) \nCurrently, Applicant has a salary of $29.80 an hour and has about $100 in \nremaining discretionary funds after his monthly expenses are satisfied. He has never \nreceived financial counseling and has no formal budget. (Tr. 36). Essentially, he lives \npaycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 43) In the meantime, he continues to look for higher paying \njobs that will enable him to make meaningful progress with his delinquent accounts. \nApplicant cited a tentative offer made to him in July 2022 that if accepted and \nemployed will pay him $260 per day. (AE F) At this time, however, nothing has been \nfinalized between Applicant and this prospective employer. (H-L) \nEndorsements \nApplicant\u2019s group manager who has known Applicant for almost 18 months \nexpressed surprise to hear about Applicant\u2019s financial situation. He credited Applicant \nwith being a model employee since he started with their company.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14;\nMcCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted misuse of his company\ncredit card is fully documented and create judgment issues as well over the\nmanagement of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).\nAlthough he qualified his admissions with explanations, his admissions can be weighed\nalong with other evidence developed during the hearing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited 2018 job loss and income limitations on his ability to address his \nSOR debts played some role in his accrual of so many delinquent debts over the past \nfew years. Considering these added financial burdens associated with his losing his job, \nmitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nOne minor utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.m) associated with Applicant\u2019s SOR accounts \nhas been satisfied and resolved by Applicant with a credited payoff. For this resolved \naccount, application of 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d bears partial application to \nApplicant\u2019s (albeit quite limited) financial situation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \nIn addressing his remaining debt delinquencies, Applicant has been less \nsuccessful. Afforded hearing and post-hearing opportunities to address his still \nunresolved accounts, Applicant has been unable to make any material progress in \naddressing his still unresolved debts. Without more payment documentation on \nApplicant\u2019s settled accounts, these accounts still reflect unfulfilled promises to pay off \nthe agreed settlement amounts in the future with his hopes of finding a more \nremunerative job. Resolution of Applicant\u2019s debt delinquencies remains a work in \nprogress that will require more time and effort from Applicant. While Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent student loans remain in deferment status, at some point in the future when \nthe enforcement pause is lifted, Applicant will need a well-developed plan to address his \nstudent loans. With the limited resources he currently has at his disposal, considerable \ndoubts remain as to how he will be able to raise enough funds to rehabilitate his student \nloans. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction to satisfy Appeal Board guidance. Payment agreements \nalone that are not accompanied by material good-faith payments still reflect promises to \npay that do not meet the good-faith payment requirements of MC 20(d). \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. Taking into account Applicant\u2019s credited defense contributions and \nhis explanations of his one-time misuse of his company\u2019s credit card and the delinquent \ndebts attributed to him in the SOR, insufficient evidence has been presented to enable \nhim to maintain sufficient control of his finances to meet minimum standards for holding \na security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and denied the allegation in SOR 1.b. His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in August 1996 and has four children, ages 15, 16, 23, and 24. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from September 1990 until he retired on a date not reflected in the record. He received a security clearance around 1994. (FORM Item 1 at 34) He submitted a security clearance application in April 2013, and his clearance was revalidated in July 2014. His clearance was apparently carried over when he began working for a defense contractor on a date not reflected in the record. In April 2021, the DOD Continuous Vetting Program discovered the two debts alleged in the SOR and reflected in a credit report from April 2021. (Form Item 6) SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a home mortgage loan that is past due for $82,044, with a total loan balance of $261,516. The last payment on the debt was in November 2020. (FORM Items 4 and 6) Applicant purchased the home in April 2005. When he was reassigned to another location, he was unable to sell the house because of market conditions, and he decided to rent it.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 10, 2022, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on August 29, 2022. On September 2, 2022, a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on September 13, 2022, and did not respond. The case was assigned \nto me on August 16, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \ndenied the allegation in SOR 1.b. His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in August \n1996 and has four children, ages 15, 16, 23, and 24. He served on active duty in the U.S. \nArmy from September 1990 until he retired on a date not reflected in the record. He \nreceived a security clearance around 1994. (FORM Item 1 at 34) He submitted a security \nclearance application in April 2013, and his clearance was revalidated in July 2014. His \nclearance was apparently carried over when he began working for a defense contractor \non a date not reflected in the record. \nIn April 2021, the DOD Continuous Vetting Program discovered the two debts \nalleged in the SOR and reflected in a credit report from April 2021. (Form Item 6)  SOR \u00b6 \n1.a alleges a home mortgage loan that is past due for $82,044, with a total loan balance \nof $261,516. The last payment on the debt was in November 2020. (FORM Items 4 and \n6) Applicant purchased the home in April 2005. When he was reassigned to another \nlocation, he was unable to sell the house because of market conditions, and he decided \nto rent it. In August 2017, a broken water pipe on the second floor of the house severely \ndamaged the house and made it unhabitable. As a result, his tenants moved out and his \nrental income stopped, making it impossible for him to make the payments on the rental \nproperty as well as his current residence. Using $25,000 from his insurance company, he \nhired a contractor to repair the home, but the contractor did not finish the job. Applicant \nobtained a second mortgage loan to hire a new contractor, who completed the repairs. \nHe remained in contact with the primary mortgage lender, who advised him to sell the \nproperty. He attached a sales contract to his answer to the SOR, signed by the parties on \nApril 27, 2022, reflecting an agreement to buy the home for $279,900, which is more than \nsufficient to pay the debt. (FORM Item 2 at 3) However, the record does not contain \nevidence of a final sale and resolution of the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a cellphone account charged off for $529. Applicant contracted \nfor cellphone service while he was stationed overseas. In his answer to the SOR, he \ndenied the debt on the ground that the sales agent told him he could terminate the \ncontract if he was reassigned back to the United States. He did not provide any \ndocumentation of a contract with a provision for termination due to military orders. He \nclaimed that he disputed this debt, but he provided no documentation of the dispute. \nHowever, he provided documentation that he paid the debt in full on May 4, 2022. (FORM \nItem 2 at 2) \nThe credit report from March 2022 reflects 27 accounts. All the accounts are \ncurrent except for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s debts are infrequent and were incurred \nunder circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The damage to \nApplicant\u2019s home, the non-performance by a contractor, and the depressed real estate \nmarket were conditions largely beyond his control. He acted responsibly by repairing his \nhome, staying in contact with the mortgage loan lender, and following the advice of the \nlender by selling his home for an amount that was more than sufficient to pay the debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant submitted \nno evidence of predatory marketing by the sales agent for the cellphone service. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant maintained \ncontact with his mortgage lender, found a buyer, and negotiated a contract for enough \nmoney to satisfy the debt. The failure of Applicant to submit evidence that the sale was \ncompleted does not preclude mitigation. An applicant is not required to be debt-free. \n\u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly given his circumstances \nand develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). Applicant\u2019s evidence reflects a reasonable plan \nand concomitant conduct. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is also established for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. It is well \nestablished that an applicant who waits until his or her clearance is in jeopardy before \nresolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018). However, in this case, \nApplicant believed that he was misled by a sales agent. It is not uncommon for military \nmembers to be confronted with an unexpected termination fee for telecommunications \nand other services when they are reassigned. Applicant\u2019s explanation for his delayed \npayment of the debt was plausible and credible. When he was unable to successfully \ndispute the debt, he paid it. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not fully established. Applicant articulated a reasonable basis for \ndisputing the cellphone debt, but he failed to provide documentary evidence of his efforts \nto dispute it. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). However, I have noted that Applicant has held a security clearance \nsince 2007, apparently without incident until the two debts alleged in the SOR were \ndiscovered. Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect that he pays his bills on time. The two debts \nalleged in the SOR arose under unusual circumstances, and Applicant has responsibly \naddressed them. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by the two debts alleged in the SOR. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked for this contractor or a predecessor thereof since January 2012. He was married from 1984 until a divorce in 2018. He has three adult children, one of whom resides with him. He earned a high school diploma in 1974 and took a semester of college courses but did not earn an undergraduate degree. He was on active duty with the Army from 1974 until 1994, when he retired with an honorable discharge. He has held a security clearance since 1974. (Tr. 15-22, 29-32; GE 1, 3) In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2019, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that he is indebted to the federal government for at least $20,000 for delinquent income taxes for tax years 2013 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He admitted the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are established through his admissions and the Government\u2019s exhibits. (SOR; Answer, GE 1-3) Applicant could not confirm whether his 2013 through 2019 federal income tax returns have been filed. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he had filed them. In March 2021, he hired a professional tax company (TC) to file his delinquent income tax returns. He paid them $10,000. He claimed that he signed a power of attorney to allow the TC to sign income tax returns on his behalf, but he did not provide document",

He has worked \nfor this contractor or a predecessor thereof since January 2012. He was married from \n1984 until a divorce in 2018. He has three adult children, one of whom resides with him. \nHe earned a high school diploma in 1974 and took a semester of college courses but \ndid not earn an undergraduate degree. He was on active duty with the Army from 1974 \nuntil 1994, when he retired with an honorable discharge. He has held a security \nclearance since 1974. (Tr. 15-22, 29-32; GE 1, 3) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2019, as required (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also \nalleged that he is indebted to the federal government for at least $20,000 for delinquent \nincome taxes for tax years 2013 through 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). He admitted the SOR \nallegations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. The SOR allegations are \nestablished through his admissions and the Government\u2019s exhibits. (SOR; Answer, GE \n1-3) \nApplicant could not confirm whether his 2013 through 2019 federal income tax \nreturns have been filed. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he had filed \nthem. In March 2021, he hired a professional tax company (TC) to file his delinquent \nincome tax returns. He paid them $10,000. He claimed that he signed a power of \nattorney to allow the TC to sign income tax returns on his behalf, but he did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to substantiate that claim. Part of his contract agreement with \nthe TC referenced his need to \u201cexecute\u201d his tax returns after verifying the information \ntherein is correct. He testified that the TC told him that they will be filing all his late \nincome tax returns simultaneously. He assumed that the TC has filed his delinquent \nincome tax returns because he no longer receives any letters or phone calls from the \nIRS. The TC told him to check his online account drop box for his filed federal income \ntax returns, but he has not had any documents in this drop box. He last contacted the \nTC in August 2023. He claimed he does not know whether he should be worried about \nthe TC\u2019s possible lack of progress because he has never been in this situation before. \nThe only reason he has not \u201cpanicked\u201d is that the letters and phone calls from the IRS \nhave stopped. (Tr. 25-29, 35-39; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn his January 2021 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (SF \n86), Applicant reported that he owed approximately $20,000 in delinquent federal taxes \nfor the 2013 through 2019 tax years. He could not confirm that he has paid any money \ntowards these delinquent taxes. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he \nhad. He testified that he believes that he actually owes approximately $60,000 in \ndelinquent income taxes. He does not believe that the $10,000 he paid to the TC is \nmeant to be used to pay his delinquent taxes. Instead, he believes that this money is \nmeant to be used to file his income tax returns. He claimed that he will use savings in \nhis retirement account to pay his delinquent federal taxes. Any adverse information not \nalleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. I will consider it when \nassessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis.

He recognized that he made a mistake and accepts responsibility \nfor it. He plans to follow up with the TC to determine its progress on his tax returns. In \nMarch 2021, during his security interview, he told the DoD investigator that he would \nfollow-up with the TC to ensure that his delinquent income tax returns were filed and \nthat he would acquire the documentary evidence to confirm these filings. He has \nprovided the TC with the information it needs to file his income tax returns for the 2020 \nand 2021 tax years. However, he has not provided the TC with this information for the \n2022 tax year. He could not confirm whether his federal income tax returns have been \nfiled for the 2020 through 2022 tax years. (Tr. 19-23, 36-37; GE 2) \nApplicant takes home between $1,700 and $2,000 per two-week pay period. He \nalso receives about $1,900 per month from his military retirement. He owns his home, \nhaving paid the mortgage on it in about 2008. His expenses consist of his spousal \nsupport of about $480 per month, a car payment of about $550 per month, and his \nproperty insurance and property taxes. A personal financial statement that he submitted \nin November 2021 did not provide information regarding a monthly surplus or deficit, \nand he did not provide evidence of this information at hearing. In his November 2021 \npersonal financial statement, he claimed to have $4,000 in a savings account, $30,000 \nin a retirement account, and $140,000 in real estate equity. (Tr. 16-18, 31; GE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns as required for the \n2013 through 2019 tax years. He also owed about $20,000 in delinquent federal taxes \nfor these tax years. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence that he has filed his federal \nincome taxes for the 2013 through 2019 tax years. He also has not provided sufficient \nevidence that has filed his federal income tax returns for the 2020 through 2022 tax \nyears. He has not provided sufficient evidence that he has paid any money towards his \nfederal income tax delinquency. He could not confirm these things when he testified, \nand he did not provide any documentary corroboration. He has not provided his tax \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npreparer the information it needs to file his 2022 federal income tax returns. He testified \nthat his delinquent federal income tax balance is now about three times higher than \nwhen he submitted his SF 86. He only contacted the TC after he had his security \ninterview. This fact tends to show that he acted because he knew his security clearance \nwas in jeopardy. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having \nbeen placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment \nand willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not \nthreatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Finally, \nhe has not provided sufficient evidence to show that he has an arrangement with the \nIRS to file his late income tax returns or pay his delinquent income taxes. \nWhile he has relied on his ex-wife and the TC to handle filing his federal income \ntax returns, it is incumbent upon him to insure he is complying with his financial \nobligations. It is not enough for him to pass the responsibility to someone else and \nassume they are handling it. His failure to monitor his federal tax situation with both his \nex-wife and the TC were within his control. If one were to assume, for the sake of \nargument, that his divorce, which can be considered beyond his control, caused his \nfailure to file his tax returns for the 2018 through 2022 tax years, he still needs to show \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Through his lack of attention to his \nincome tax filings and income tax delinquencies before and after he hired the TC, he \nhas not shown responsible or good-faith behavior. None of the mitigating conditions fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered his \nlengthy military service and the significant number of years that he has held a security \nclearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, and essentially denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.k, 2.a and 2.b, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 49 years old. He served in the military from 1994 until he retired honorably in 2014 in the paygrade of E-7. He married in 1999. He has three children with his wife. He has three other children from relationships. A son was born in 2000. In 2001, 2 he fathered a daughter with another woman and later learned that he fathered a second daughter with her, born in 2003. He was not made aware until 2005 of the second daughter. He paid child support for the two children and when he learned of the third child, he was required to pay back child support owed from 2003 to 2005.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 10, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations and Guideline E, personal conduct. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn August 25, 2022, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

The objections were sustained. There were no additional \nobjections, and GE 1 through 3 and 6 through 16 were admitted in evidence. Applicant \ntestified and offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through R. There were no objections, and \nthey were admitted in evidence. The record was held open until September 7, 2023, to \npermit him an opportunity to provide additional documents he wanted considered. He \noffered AE S, which was admitted without objection. He also offered an unmarked \ndocument reflecting payment receipts. I have marked it as AE T. There was no objection, \nand it was admitted in evidence. No other documents were submitted, and the record \nclosed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 12, 2023. \nProcedural Matters \nIn accordance with DOD Directive 5220.6 the Government moved to amend the \nSOR to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted. The Government also moved \nto admit part of GE 4 that Applicant authenticated during testimony, specifically page 2 \nthe last paragraph and page 3, the first paragraph. Applicant specifically testified that the \nparagraphs were accurate and a representation of his conversation with the government \ninvestigator. Applicant objected stating that the facts were already established on the \nrecord and therefore this information was cumulative and unnecessary to amend the \nSOR. In addition, Applicant objected to the amendment to the SOR. Applicant\u2019s objections \nwere overruled. The Government\u2019s motions were granted. (Tr. 179-185) The SOR \namendment is included in Hearing Exhibit I. The SOR was amended by adding the \nfollowing allegation: \n2.c You falsified material facts during a September 16, 2015, interview with \nan authorized investigator for the U.S. Department of Defense when you \ndescribed the facts and circumstances from your NJP you received in \nFebruary 2013. You failed to disclose the foreign contact from El Salvador \nthat you believed was the mother of your child that you described in your \ntestimony during your security clearance hearing on August 24, 2023.  \nThe Government noted that the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 \n1.j and SOR \u00b6 1.i is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.k. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c, and essentially \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.k, 2.a and 2.b, with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He served in the military from 1994 until he retired \nhonorably in 2014 in the paygrade of E-7. He married in 1999. He has three children with \nhis wife.

He was not made aware until 2005 of the second \ndaughter. He paid child support for the two children and when he learned of the third child, \nhe was required to pay back child support owed from 2003 to 2005. He testified that all \nof his child support has been satisfied, and he no longer has any child support obligations \nsince the children are now adults. (Tr. 27-28, 30-36, 157-160, GE 1, 2, 3) \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and a master\u2019s degree in 2020. He \nhas been employed by federal contractors since January 2015. He reported a period of \nunemployment after his retirement from the military from November 2014 to January \n2015. (Tr. 72, 156; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant testified he deployed to a foreign country in 2007. While there, he had \nsexual intercourse with a foreign national four times, twice at an apartment and twice at \na friend\u2019s residence. He testified that she was not a prostitute, and he never paid her \nmoney. He was married at the time. He did not report her as a foreign contact. He testified \nthat he did not know his contact with her was considered a \u201cforeign contact\u201d and should \nhave been reported. He testified prior to his deployment he had not been briefed on \ncontacts with foreign nationals. (Tr. 32, 117-120, 123-124, 187) \nIn 2012, Applicant deployed again to the same country. He had a military member \nas a roommate at the hotel. They were staying at the same hotel he had stayed at during \nhis 2007 deployment. One of the hotel staff recognized him and was aware he had a \n\u201crelationship\u201d with a woman when he was there in 2007 and inferred that he had fathered \na child during his previous deployment. Applicant testified that he asked the hotel \nemployee to provide him the woman\u2019s telephone number, which he did. He contacted the \nwoman and they met at the hotel. He asked her to return and bring the child. He testified \nthat he purchased a hotel room because his roommate was smoking in their room. She \nmet him in his hotel room with her child. He determined he was not the father of the child. \nHe ordered food through room service. They did not engage in sexual conduct during \ntheir 2012 meetings. The information about Applicant\u2019s rendezvous came to light when \nthe Naval Criminal Investigative Service was investigating potential prostitution at the \nhotel. He testified that the investigation determined she was not a prostitute. (Tr. 37-44, \n120-126) \nIn February 2013, Applicant went to a Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 15 \nnonjudicial proceeding (NJP) for violation of Article 92, failure to obey an order for \nwrongfully and knowingly having contact with a suspected prostitute in a foreign country \nand having a non-military guest in his hotel room. His punishment was forfeitures of pay \nfor two months and 45 days of restriction. He was an E-7 at the time. (Tr. 37, 41-44) \nIn June 2015, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). Section \n15 requested he provide information about his military history. It specifically asked for the \ndates of service. Applicant responded to this inquiry with his active duty dates from \n\u201c09/1994\u201d to \u201c10/2014.\u201d The SCA also asked him if he was discharged, which he \nresponded \u201cyes.\u201d It then asked for the details of his discharge, and he responded \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201chonorable.\u201d Another question asked: \u201cProvide other discharge type.\u201d Applicant \nresponded: \u201cRetired with 20 years 1 month from active service.\u201d This was information that \nwas not repopulated. He reported he did not have any additional military service to report. \nThe bold header labeled \u201cDiscipline\u201d asked: In the last 7 years, have you been \nsubjected to court martial or other disciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ), such as Article 15, Captain\u2019s mast, Article 135 Court of Inquiry, \netc.\u201d Applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d (Tr. 47, 126-132; GE 1) \nApplicant explained he did not disclose his NJP because the SCA repopulated his \nresponse of \u201cno\u201d from his previous SCA. He said he was in a \u201crobotic\u201d mode and missed \nanswering this question correctly. He provided other new information as noted above, \nsuch as duty stations and his active-duty dates and characterization of his discharge. \nApplicant admitted that he did not disclose his NJP and said it was not intentional. I did \nnot find Applicant credible. I find he deliberately failed to disclose his February 2013 NJP \non his 2015 SCA. (Tr. 47; 126-132; GE 1) \nApplicant testified that when he was interviewed by a government investigator in \nSeptember 2015, he provided information about his 2013 NJP when the investigator \nspecifically asked him about the details. He said he told the investigator that he did not \ndisclose the NJP on his SCA due to an oversight. Applicant testified that he told the \ninvestigator that he was unaware that his roommate had three females in their hotel room \nfor two parties. Applicant said he did not attend the parties. He was at work. He told the \ninvestigator that there was an investigation about the females in the hotel room he shared \nwith a roommate, but they were not prostitutes. Having any guests while they were in a \nforeign country was prohibited. He said he was unaware of the party. He admitted at his \nhearing that he did not tell the investigator that he had met privately with a female foreign \nnational whom he believed could potentially be the mother of his child. He rented a hotel \nroom to meet with her, which was in violation of military orders. He met with her twice on \ntwo different days. Applicant\u2019s testimony lacked candor and was not credible. I find he \ndeliberately falsified and concealed material facts when he failed to provide accurate and \nhonest information to the government investigator and did not disclose that he met \nprivately with a female foreign national in a separate hotel room as he testified at his \nhearing. (Tr. 132-140; GE 1) \nIn 2003, Applicant was granted a conditional security clearance because of \nfinancial concerns. He was cautioned that future receipt of derogatory information or his \nfailure to comply fully with the conditions of his clearance would be cause for immediate \nreconsideration. He was required to continue to pay his child support and arrearage, \nresolve any additional delinquent debts and remain current on his financial obligations. \n(GE 6) \nIn 2011, Applicant was again granted a conditional security clearance because of \nfinancial concerns. His 2011 conditional security determination stated: \nIt is imperative that you continue working with your creditors to establish \npayment plans on all of your delinquent accounts.

(GE 7) \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to never being properly educated about \nfinancial management or how credit worked. He also attributed it to his son coming to live \nwith him in 2015. (Tr. 30; GE 6, 7) \nApplicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2014. In July 2014, he had \napproximately $82,000 of debt discharged. He explained he was getting ready to retire \nfrom the military and his wife had been working only sporadically. They wanted to save \ntheir house and get a reset on their finances. (Tr. 48; GE 10) \nApplicant testified that after retiring from the military in October 2014, he was \nunable to get a job for about six to seven months. From 2015 to 2019, his wife worked \nsporadically, and they again struggled financially. He has a child who is a diabetic. He \nsaid his military medical coverage for retirees, Tricare, was expensive for her needs. He \nalso had child support payments. He and his wife were also helping her mother who was \nstruggling financially after her spouse passed away. In 2015, without prior notice, the \nmother of his son dropped him off with Applicant to care for him permanently. He testified \nthat they got behind on their car payments. He also disclosed in his July 2020 and April \n2021 SCAs that he went on a \u201cfamily vacation [c]ruise in 2015 or 2016. Cozumel Mexico \nCarnival cruise line.\u201d (Tr. 48-51, 164; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant testified that it was disruptive in 2015 when his son moved in with him \nand his family. His son was diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder. He was \nfrequently in trouble at school and was suspended and expelled three times from three \ndifferent schools. He was breaking into cars and using marijuana. He would run away for \nthree to four days at a time. Applicant was concerned about his conduct and the people \nhe spent time with. His son was concerned there was a bounty on him. Applicant\u2019s son \nwas shot in February 2020. He was shot a second time in June 2020 while waiting in line \nto apply for a job. He did not survive. The crime has not been solved. This tragic event \nimpacted the whole family. (Tr. 59-63; AE R) \nIn July 2020, Applicant completed another SCA. He did not disclose any debts in \ncollection, charged off, or if he had property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed. He \nalso did not disclose that in the past seven years if he had been delinquent more than \n120 days on any debt and was currently more than 120 days delinquent on any debt, as \nrequired under Section 26. He testified that his failure to disclose this information was an \noversight. The SCA also asked if in the past seven years he filed a petition for bankruptcy. \nHe disclosed he had filed bankruptcy in 2012. (Tr. 140; GE 2) \nAs noted above Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings were in 2014. Under Section \n26, a box for optional comments is provided.

(GE 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2021 SCA, he did not disclose any debts in collection, charged \noff, or if he had property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed. He also did not disclose \nthat in the past seven years if he had been delinquent more than 120 days on any debt \nand was currently more than 120 days delinquent on any debt, as required under Section \n26. He wrote the identical comments under the optional comment section, except he \ncorrected the percentage of his kidney that was removed. He also disclosed he filed \nbankruptcy in 2012, which was incorrect. (Tr. 141-143; GE 3) \nApplicant defaulted on his mortgage that went into foreclosure. (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nApplicant testified that the foreclosure was satisfied through his 2014 bankruptcy. He \nprovided a document to show his mortgage payment on a house he purchased in January \n2023 ($459,000) is current. (Tr. 149-152; GE 12, 15; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($17,888) (duplicate alleged in \u00b6 1.i ($21,386)) alleged a charged-off \ncar loan. Applicant testified he purchased a vehicle in October 2016 after his son began \nliving with him because they needed a bigger car. He said his wife was making the \npayments, so he was unaware when it became delinquent. He said he was confused \nabout this debt because at the time he and his wife owned two vehicles of the same make, \nbut different models. He admitted at one time he was behind on payments for both \nvehicles. He denied this debt (twice) in his answer to the SOR stating that he did not know \nthe nature or origin of the debt alleged. The car was repossessed. He admitted he was \naware of the repossession. He tried to reclaim the vehicle but was unsuccessful. He said \nhe was unaware of the balance owed. He said he could not locate the debt. He explained \nhis failure to disclose this repossession and charged-off debt on his SCA was due to an \noversight.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant has a long history of accumulating delinquent debts and being unable to \npay them. He was granted a conditional clearance in 2003 and was required to resolve \nany additional delinquent debts and remain current on his financial obligations. In 2011, \nhe was again granted a conditional security clearance advising him to establish payment \nplans on all of his delinquent accounts; continue to make full and timely payments to all \ncreditors with the intent on becoming current on all accounts; and thereafter, maintain a \nstable and solvent financial status, ensuring all payments to creditors are accomplished \nin a regular and timely manner. In 2014, he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy and had \napproximately $82,000 of debt discharged. In 2016, he was again accumulating \ndelinquent debts. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nSince having his debts discharged in bankruptcy in 2014, Applicant has had two \ncars repossessed and eventually reclaimed one.

He satisfied medical bills that were not paid by the mother \nof his daughter. Applicant had a period of unemployment after his military retirement. He \nsaid he was out of work for several months due to surgery in 2019. His wife\u2019s work history \nis sporadic, and he was paying child support. \nI have considered that currently Applicant has only one delinquent debt that \nremains unresolved. He is no longer paying child support. I have also considered that he \ntook his family on a cruise during a period when he said he was having financial problems. \nHe also purchased a vehicle in 2019, presumably when he was either unemployed or \nreceiving reduced income, and he has monthly payments of $1,000. The greatest concern \nis that Applicant repeatedly was granted conditional security clearances, was warned and \nhas been fully aware that future issues with his finances would jeopardize his security \nclearance, and he continued to have financial issues. Even after his 2014 bankruptcy \ndischarge where he had a complete financial reset, he again had difficulty paying his bills \nand had two cars repossessed. \nApplicant has a significant payment for a repossessed vehicle that he no longer \nhas possession of and only recently made arrangements to pay. He has a twenty-year \nhistory of failing to timely meet his financial obligations. There is insufficient evidence to \nconclude future financial issues are unlikely to recur based on his history. His conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. \nAlthough some of his financial problems may have been beyond his control, it is \nonly recently that he has acted responsibly in resolving them. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some \napplication. He has participated in financial counseling. He has resolved most of his \ndelinquent debts, except the debt for the repossessed vehicle, for which he only recently \nmade arrangements to satisfy. The question remains that based on his long history of \nfinancial problems whether he will be financially responsible in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) \nand 20(d) have some application. Despite some mitigation, Applicant needs more time to \nestablish a solid financial track record of paying his bills on time and not accumulating \nnew delinquent debts. It is too soon to conclude he has fully mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his finances. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical or mental health professional involved in making a \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other \nofficial government representative; and  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that \ncreates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a foreign \nintelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging \nin activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or \ncommunity standing.  \nApplicant was arrested and charged with domestic battery involving touching or \nstriking his spouse. The evidence supports that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose \nhis February 2013 NJP on his June 2015 SCA. The evidence supports that when \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2015, he falsified \nmaterial facts provided to the investigator, specifically that he failed to disclose that he \nhad unauthorized contact in a hotel room with a female foreign national whom he believed \nwas potentially the mother of his child. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.  \n \nApplicant successfully completed the PTD program through the Veteran\u2019s Court \nregarding his domestic violence. During that period, he was grieving the death of his son. \nAlthough, the offense is not minor, his conduct was infrequent and happened under \nunique circumstances that are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) apply to SOR \u00b6 \n2.a \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose his NJP on his 2015 SCA and when \nquestioned by a government investigator in 2015, he failed to provide accurate and \nhonest information. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b-2.c) I found Applicant\u2019s testimony often lacked candor \nand credibility. The security clearance process relies on those seeking a clearance to be \nhonest and forthcoming. Applicant failed to do so, which casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply to \nthose allegations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and character evidence. Despite some \nmitigation, I find it is insufficient to overcome the security concerns raised.

This is her first time applying for a security clearance. \nShe is a single mother of three teenage children, ages 16, 15, and 14. (GE 1; Tr. 20-21) \nApplicant completed an electronic questionnaires for investigations processing (e-\nQIP) on September 16, 2018. A subsequent background investigation revealed the \nfollowing delinquent accounts: a $9,459 collection debt owed as a result of an automobile \nrepossessed in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 35); a $8,595 collection debt \nas a result of an automobile repossessed in 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. \n39-41); a $1,105 charged-off account owed to a credit union (SOR \u00b6 1.c: GE 3 at 2; GE \n4 at 4); a $1,029 delinquent credit card account that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d: \nGE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5); a $760 credit card account that was placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e: GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5); a $140 charged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.f: GE 3 at 2); a $1,471 \ncharged-off account (SOR \u00b6 1.g:  GE 4 at 4); and a $5,698 account that was placed for \ncollection. (SOR \u00b6 1.h: GE 4 at 4) \nApplicant\u2019s former boyfriend and the father of her children, was an abusive \nalcoholic. The abuse increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, she \nmoved out of the apartment with her children. Before she decided to move out, there were \nthree domestic violence incidents initiated by her former partner that made her realize \nshe needed to move out for the sake of the children. She initially moved in with her parents \nwho live in a one-bedroom apartment. She paid her parents $1,000 a month rent when \nshe and children lived with them. She rented a place for her and the children to live a few \nmonths later. The monthly rent was $1,632.

The children\u2019s father does not \nprovide child support, although Applicant recently filed for child support about a week \nbefore the hearing. She realized the only way to get money from him would be through a \nchild support order because his paycheck could be garnished. (Tr. 26-27) \nApplicant intends to pay her debts. She does not live an expensive lifestyle and \ndoes not spend money on gambling.  She needs time to resolve her debts. (Tr. 19-20) \nThe $9,459 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was the debt remaining after one of \nApplicant\u2019s cars was repossessed in 2019. The debt was paid off through garnishment. \nHer paycheck was garnished between $700 to $900 a period beginning in May 2022. She \ntestified the garnishment stopped a few months ago. (Tr. 35-38; AE B)  She  was unable \nto pay any of the remaining SOR debts. (Tr. 39-46) She pays her current debts and her \nrent. Most of the debts alleged in the SOR occurred as result of her relationship with her \nabusive boyfriend. When she lived with him, he was not working on a regular basis. His \nmother and occasionally his sister lived with them. Neither worked. Applicant was the only \nbreadwinner in the household. She would often give her boyfriend $100 a day to buy \nalcohol so he would not bother her. (Tr. 48-50) \nApplicant has been on her own for about two years. A few months ago, Applicant\u2019s \nfather suffered a heart attack. She had to pay his mortgage while he recovered from his \nillness. This prevented her from making more payments towards her delinquent accounts. \nApplicant currently does not own a car. She takes an Uber to work because her day \nbegins earlier than when public transportation is available. She takes public transportation \nhome. Despite all of these challenges, she believes she is in a better financial situation \non her own. She is current on federal and state income taxes. (Tr. 54 \u2013 59) \nApplicant currently earns $31 per hour. She also works overtime hours. Her net \npaycheck is $2,600 a pay period. She is paid twice a month, so she earns $5,200 monthly. \nHer monthly expenses include: rent $2,000; and utilities $150 - $200. She estimates she \nhas a couple hundred dollars left over each month after expenses. (Tr. 29) \nWhole-Person Evidence \nMr. R., Applicant\u2019s superior, states Applicant is an asset to their team. She has \ncompleted all the necessary briefings regarding safeguarding sensitive information. (AE \nA)  Mr. T. has known Applicant for several years. He has observed her duty performance. \nShe is dedicated to her job and is very professional. She performs her duties in an \nexcellent manner. He has worked at a high-level state commission and currently works \nat a high-level at the federal level. He believes Applicant is worthy of maintaining her \nsecurity clearance. She possesses \u201cthe analytical ability, judgment, discretion, personal \nintegrity, and represents the organization in a positive light.\u201d (AE C) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government met its burden of producing sufficient, reliable information to \nsupport all of the SOR allegations that Applicant accrued significant past due or \ndelinquent debt that, with one exception, is still outstanding. This information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAvailable information also requires consideration of the following pertinent AG \u00b6 \n20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or under control: and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies because most of Applicant\u2019s debts arose during and shortly \nafter the breakup of her relationship with an abusive alcoholic. She is in the process of \nputting her life back together. She lives simply and her main focus is raising her three \nchildren. While she still needs to resolve the delinquent debts, the debts do not cast \ndoubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because the debts incurred by Applicant were caused by \ncircumstances beyond her control. Applicant is doing what she can to resolve her financial \nsituation. She has not incurred significant new debts. She just has a lot of delinquent debt \nincurred from a disastrous, abusive relationship. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. Applicant did not attend financial counseling from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service. Applicant \nstill has many debts to resolve. It would be helpful to obtain credit counseling so she can \nlearn steps to deal with her delinquent accounts and to develop a plan to avoid getting \ninto additional financial trouble. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies with respect to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Although the \ndebt was garnished, Applicant resolved the account. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nI considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character references and her years of favorable \nemployment. I considered that she is a devoted mother to her three children and that she \noccasionally supports her parents when needed. Most of all, I considered that her partner \nand the father of her children was an abusive alcoholic. In February 2021, she was brave \nenough to leave him. He provides no support and left her with a lot of debt for her to \nresolve on her own. Applicant is doing the best she can. The anticipated court order will \nenable her to receive additional resources to raise her kids. Based on the facts of this \ncase, I do not consider her a security risk. It takes a long time to recover from the end of \na relationship. Applicant\u2019s financial situation will likely improve in the future. It is \nrecommended that she seek financial counseling from a non-profit credit counseling \nservice so she get a better assessment of her financial situation. Security concerns under \nFinancial Considerations are mitigated. Applicant is warned that if she continues to \nacquire new delinquent debts, she may lose her security clearance at some point in the \nfuture. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or continue \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

She spends \nless now, and she is working on paying all her debts on time. (Item 4.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Having reviewed all of the mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20, \nI find only the following potentially applicable: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nI have considered condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts went into \ncollections between 2017 and 2019. That is not that long ago. The debts are numerous \nand remain in default today. Her debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered AG \u00b6 20(b). The record shows that Applicant\u2019s financial travails \nwere caused by the need for her nephews to come and live with her and her husband. \nApplicant, therefore, moved to a larger home to accommodate her nephews. That move \nand related costs increased her expenses and caused the delinquent debts she now \nconfronts. To ameliorate her financial troubles, she moved in with her adult daughter. \nAlthough she claims she is now working with her creditors to resolve her debts, she has \nnot provided any documents to support this assertion. The Appeals Board has routinely \nexpected applicants to submit documents supporting their explanations and that their \nindebtedness is being addressed concretely and is on the way to being resolved. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 20-00615 at 2 (Jun. 7, 2021). On this record, I cannot find that AG \u00b6 \n20(b) applies. \nThe Whole-Person Concept \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about her eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 k:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n           \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

(Transcript (Tr.) at 19-20, 23, 27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) Applicant worked as waitress and manager at a restaurant from about 2002 through 2008. She bought the restaurant in 2008 for about $1.2 million. She paid $150,000, and the remainder was financed by the previous owner. Her loan payments were about $10,000 per month. The recession hit, and a new highway bypass diverted drivers around her small town. It was difficult to maintain the restaurant. She did not pay the property taxes, and she did not pay the IRS and the state the payroll taxes she withheld from her employees\u2019 wages. The loan agreement required Applicant to remain current with the property taxes. In about 2012, the previous owner threatened to foreclose on the property and sue Applicant. She returned the restaurant to the previous owner without court action. Applicant estimates that she paid the owner about $540,000 over the course of the four years she had the restaurant. None of that was ever reclaimed from the previous owner after the owner resold the restaurant.

She has worked for \nher current employer or a predecessor company since 2012. She earned an associate \ndegree in 2022. She is married with a 22-year-old child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 19-20, 23, \n27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant worked as waitress and manager at a restaurant from about 2002 \nthrough 2008. She bought the restaurant in 2008 for about $1.2 million. She paid \n$150,000, and the remainder was financed by the previous owner. Her loan payments \nwere about $10,000 per month. The recession hit, and a new highway bypass diverted \ndrivers around her small town. It was difficult to maintain the restaurant. She did not pay \nthe property taxes, and she did not pay the IRS and the state the payroll taxes she \nwithheld from her employees\u2019 wages. The loan agreement required Applicant to remain \ncurrent with the property taxes. In about 2012, the previous owner threatened to \nforeclose on the property and sue Applicant. She returned the restaurant to the previous \nowner without court action. Applicant estimates that she paid the owner about $540,000 \nover the course of the four years she had the restaurant. None of that was ever \nreclaimed from the previous owner after the owner resold the restaurant. (Tr. at 15, 20, \n28-34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR GE 1, 2) \nApplicant accrued a number of debts from her attempt at making the restaurant \nwork, and the IRS and her state filed tax liens against her, presumably for the unpaid \npayroll taxes. The state filed liens of $14,592 in April 2011; and $55,144 in September \n2012. The IRS filed liens of $11,483 in August 2012; $51,967 in December 2012; and \n$20,900 in December 2012. She filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in 2013, and her \ndischargeable debts were discharged the same year. The bankruptcy did not affect her \nunpaid taxes. (Tr. at 15-16; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4, 6-12) \nApplicant retained an attorney to negotiate with her state. The attorney \nnegotiated an offer-in-compromise with the state. She finished paying the negotiated \namount in 2016, and the state tax liens were released in December 2020. (Tr. at 15-17, \n20-21; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nApplicant contacted the IRS several times. She was told in about 2017 or 2018 \nthat she owed so much in comparison to her income that the IRS considered the taxes \nuncollectable. The IRS would maintain the liens on her property so that it could collect \nany profit from a sale, and it would withhold any refunds she would otherwise receive, \nbut it would not actively collect the taxes unless her income significantly increased. She \nwas also told that the IRS cannot collect taxes after ten years. (Tr. at 17; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR) \nApplicant decided not to attempt to pay the taxes, and she would wait until they \nwere more than ten years old and uncollectable. She submitted an online IRS tax \naccount statement from the IRS obtained in October 2022. The earliest year shown was \n2012, which reported a balance of $13,229. The only other year with a balance was \n2014, with a balance of $194.

I have been informed by Tax Advocate/IRS that it is \nconsidered in unpayable status and now after more than 10 years is uncollectable.\u201d The \nIRS has not acted on the applications. (Tr. at 18, 21-23; AE A-D) \nApplicant regrets not paying the payroll taxes. She stated that she has learned a \nvaluable lesson from the experience. Her finances are otherwise stable. Her most \nrecent credit report lists a mortgage loan and two other accounts. She is current on all \nthree accounts. (Tr. at 18-19, 24-25, 28, 32-33; GE 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant owned a restaurant from 2008 until she had to return it to the previous \nowner in 2012. She was unable to pay many of her debts. She filed a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy case in 2013, and her dischargeable debts were discharged the same year. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant chose not to pay the IRS and the state the payroll taxes she withheld \nfrom her employees\u2019 wages. That constitutes an unwillingness to satisfy debts \nregardless of the ability to do so. AG \u00b6 19(b) is applicable to the payroll taxes. AG \u00b6 \n19(f) addresses income taxes, not payroll taxes. AG \u00b6 19(f) is not applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe failure of Applicant\u2019s restaurant was beyond her control. I find that filing a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy case was a responsible way to deal with the debts other than the \npayroll taxes. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nApplicant was in a difficult situation, but not paying payroll taxes was not an \nacceptable option. If a business cannot pay its employees\u2019 payroll taxes, it is not a \nviable business and it should fail. Failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and \nsystems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is essential for protecting \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, \n2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as paying \ntaxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable to the unpaid payroll \ntaxes. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe state payroll taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e) were paid in about 2016. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(d) and 20(g) are applicable to the state payroll taxes. \nApplicant has done nothing to resolve the federal payroll taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to \n1.c), except to wait until they become more than ten years old and uncollectable. The \nAppeal Board has long recognized that debts remain relevant for security clearance \npurposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the statute of \nlimitations. That is, a judge may consider the underlying circumstances of these \nuncollectable debts in evaluating whether an applicant demonstrated good judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. \n27, 2003). Reliance on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to \nresolve debts and is of limited mitigative value. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01231 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2015). \nI am unable to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances or \nthat she made a good-faith effort to pay her payroll taxes. Her financial issues continue \nto cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There are \nno mitigating conditions applicable to the unpaid payroll taxes. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He served 22 years as an Enlisted member in the active duty U.S. Navy, honorably retiring in 1995. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2001. Applicant has worked as an engineer with Federal contractors since 2000 and has been with his sponsoring employer since January 2020. He was granted a security clearance for the first time in 1973, which he held throughout his Navy career. He was granted a security clearance again in 2001 as a contractor and has maintained his clearance up to the present. He seeks to retain his national security eligibility in connection with his current employment. (Item 3 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25; Item 4 at Sections 13A, 25.)

The three SOR allegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer. The allegations are also evidenced by Applicant\u2019s statements in his e-QIP and his comments made during an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management held on October 28, 2021.

On September 2, 2022, Department Counsel \nsubmitted the Department\u2019s written case. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), consisting of Items 1 through 5, was provided to Applicant, who received the \nFORM on September 16, 2022. \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to raise objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant submitted a written \nresponse to the Government\u2019s FORM on September 17, 2022 (Response). Department \nCounsel did not object to Applicant\u2019s submission. In the Response, Applicant asserted no \nobjections to the Government\u2019s evidence (Items 3 to 5) attached to the FORM. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s Items 3 through 5 are admitted into evidence. The case was \nassigned to me on November 29, 2022. Based upon a review of the pleadings and \nexhibits as well as the arguments set forth in the FORM and the Response, national \nsecurity eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 69 years old, married for the third time, and has one adult child and \nfive adult stepchildren. He served 22 years as an Enlisted member in the active duty U.S. \nNavy, honorably retiring in 1995. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2001. Applicant has \nworked as an engineer with Federal contractors since 2000 and has been with his \nsponsoring employer since January 2020. He was granted a security clearance for the \nfirst time in 1973, which he held throughout his Navy career. He was granted a security \nclearance again in 2001 as a contractor and has maintained his clearance up to the \npresent. He seeks to retain his national security eligibility in connection with his current \nemployment. (Item 3 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25; Item 4 at Sections 13A, 25.) \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government alleged in the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for a security \nclearance because of his illegal use of a controlled substance (marijuana). The three SOR \nallegations are supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer. The allegations are \nalso evidenced by Applicant\u2019s statements in his e-QIP and his comments made during an \ninterview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management held on October \n28, 2021. (Items 2, 3, and 5.) \nThe details regarding the three SOR allegations and Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nas follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a. Marijuana use from July 2019 to at least August 2021 while granted \naccess to classified information. Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that he used marijuana \na small number of times while on vacation in July 2019. He held a security clearance at \nthat time. He experimented with marijuana to see if it helped him manage his pain from \nillness. He further disclosed that he began using marijuana again in February 2020.

He \ncommented that he started using marijuana \u201cseveral times a day on a daily basis.\u201d The \nperiod of his use continued up to the month he certified the e-QIP, i.e., August 2021. He \nalso wrote, \u201cPer discussion with my medical provider, I intend to smoke marijuana to \naddress Anxiety and Pain Management as well as [an] appetite stimulant in support of \nmy Stage 4 Prostate Cancer.\u201d He commented further that his prostate cancer \u201chas \nmetastasized to his bones.\u201d He avoids using marijuana during the workday. Applicant has \nnot reported to his security officer or anyone else at his employer that he is using \nmarijuana because he knows that it is a security violation. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 39-42; \nItem 5 at 1.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Purchase of marijuana from February 2020 to at least July 2021 while \ngranted access to classified information. Applicant purchased marijuana in 2019 in a state \nwhere it was legal to do so. When he began using marijuana daily in 2020, he purchased \nthe drug from his grandson and continues to do so because it is illegal to purchase \nmarijuana in his home state. He also intends to cultivate marijuana for his personal use, \nwhich he asserts is legal under the laws of his state. (Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 41; Item 5 at \n1.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Intent to continue to purchase and use marijuana in the future. \nApplicant intends to continue using marijuana because it provides the best management \nof his pain. He stated in his security clearance interview that he would consider ceasing \nhis illegal drug use if he has to stop in order to keep his security clearance. He said that \nhe would need to discuss his options with his doctors. His doctors are aware that he uses \nmarijuana for pain management. There is no updated information in the record, including \nin the Response, as to whether Applicant has ever engaged in the cultivation of marijuana. \n(Item 2 at 1; Item 3 at 40; Item 5 at 1.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia;  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse.  \nThe admitted facts in this case establish all of the above disqualifying conditions \nand shift the burden to Applicant to provide mitigation of the Government\u2019s security \nconcerns. Guideline H lists four conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate security \nconcerns raised by the potentially disqualifying conditions set forth above. The following \ncondition has possible application to the facts in this case. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana has occurred under \nunusual and sympathetic circumstances. However, the circumstances do not make it \nunlikely that his use of marijuana will not recur. Applicant had the opportunity before \nsubmitting his Answer and again before submitting his Response to consult with his \nmedical providers about alternatives to marijuana use for pain management and to cease \nusing marijuana, but the record closed without any such actions. Even if he had ceased \nhis illegal drug use at some point, it may not have mitigated all of the security concerns \nraised by his recent drug use while holding a security clearance. Notably, he failed to \ndisclose his illegal drug use to his Facility Security Officer or anyone at his employer \nbecause he knew that his drug use was a violation of his responsibilities as a clearance \nholder. Applicant\u2019s behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. He has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his use of marijuana while \nholding a security clearance, his purchase of marijuana, and his stated intent to continue \nusing marijuana in the future. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. I have weighed Applicant\u2019s lengthy service in the Navy and his honorable \ndischarge and retirement from the Navy. I have also weighed the difficult choice Applicant \nhas had to make between addressing his pain from a serious illness and his obligations \nto safeguard classified information and comply with Federal drug laws. The record \ncontains no information about any efforts Applicant has made with the advice of his \nmedical providers to eliminate marijuana as a pain management drug and find a suitable \nlegal alternative in the form of prescription medication. As noted, his failure to report his \ndrug use is an aggravating factor raising doubts about his reliability and trustworthiness. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H:  \nAGAINSTAPPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He enlisted and served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2011 to December 2014 and in the Army Reserve from 2015 to June 2018. He was honorably discharged from active duty but was administratively separated from the Army Reserve under other than honorable conditions (OTH Separation). He was also reduced in rank from Specialist to Private First Class. He claims he was separated from the Reserve because he missed monthly drills due to an injury. He has held a security clearance since about 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2018 after attending college classes part time. He has also pursued two professional certifications. Since his discharge from active duty, he has worked for a defense contractor on two occasions, April 2017 through September 2019 and January 2021 to the present. He is seeking national security eligibility in relation to his current employment as a technology specialist.

Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March 16, 2023. DOHA \nassigned the case to me on March 27, 2023. DOHA issued a Notice of Video \nTeleconference Hearing on April 5, 2023, scheduling the hearing on May 12, 2023. The \ncase was heard as scheduled. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. Applicant testified \non his own behalf and introduced 13 exhibits, marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough M. All exhibits were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on May 19, 2023. (Tr. at 11-14.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old. He married a Japanese citizen in January 2017 and has \na young child. He enlisted and served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2011 to \nDecember 2014 and in the Army Reserve from 2015 to June 2018. He was honorably \ndischarged from active duty but was administratively separated from the Army Reserve \nunder other than honorable conditions (OTH Separation). He was also reduced in rank \nfrom Specialist to Private First Class. He claims he was separated from the Reserve \nbecause he missed monthly drills due to an injury. He has held a security clearance since \nabout 2010. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in June 2018 after attending college classes \npart time. He has also pursued two professional certifications. Since his discharge from \nactive duty, he has worked for a defense contractor on two occasions, April 2017 through \nSeptember 2019 and January 2021 to the present. He is seeking national security \neligibility in relation to his current employment as a technology specialist. (Tr. at 14-19; \nGE 1 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 15, 17, 18, 25; GE 3 at 7; GE 4 at 10; AE E; AE G; AE L.) \nWhen he served in the Army on active duty, Applicant\u2019s duty station was in \nColorado Springs, Colorado. He never deployed. He has a 100% disability rating from the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. He suffers from service-related depression and anxiety. \n(Tr. at 18, 68-69; AE F.)  \nApplicant testified that he received the OTH Separation in July 2018 from the Army \nReserve due to his inability to report to Reserve drilling because he was bedridden after \na motorcycle accident in the summer of 2015. He testified that he advised his command \nof his disability and his inability to drill with his unit. He did not appear before an \nadministrative separation board. He received a letter advising him that he was being \nseparated under other than honorable conditions. Upon being questioned, he \nacknowledged that he missed drills for \u201ca year or two\u201d in the 2017-to-2018 period. He \nsubsequently limited the time he missed drills to \u201ca year.\u201d He then could not explain the \nthree-year time gap between the motorcycle accident and his separation in July 2018.

(Tr. at 30-40.) \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his \ncriminal conduct, which raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness; and about his ability and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegation of criminal conduct. The \nspecifics of the charges, the underlying conduct, and the prosecution are as follows: \n1.a. May 2018 Spousal Assault. Applicant was charged with Assault by Means \nLikely to Produce Great Bodily Injury and four counts of Battery. His wife, the victim in this \nassault, declined to prosecute Applicant, and the District Attorney dropped the charges. \nThe local City Attorney then filed charges. Applicant entered into an agreement with the \nprosecutor in 2022 or 2023, which provided that the charges would be dismissed in April \n2023 if Applicant complied with the terms and conditions of the agreement. The charges \nwere dismissed about two weeks before the DOHA hearing. (Tr. at 22-23, 541; GE 1 at \nSection 22; GE 5; AE D.) \nThe police report of the incident reflects the date and time of the domestic violence \nincident as May 25, 2018, at 7:40 am. The police were called and arrived at Applicant\u2019s \nresidence. They took a statement from Applicant\u2019s wife. The police statement provides a \ndetailed description of Applicant\u2019s actions that morning, which began with yelling by \nApplicant because his wife woke him up to go to work. He then threw a blanket over his \nwife\u2019s head and strangled her with his hand or arm for about 30 seconds. She could not \nbreathe during that period. She freed herself from his grip, and he pushed her face onto \na couch cushion for about a minute when she again could not breathe. She freed herself \nand tried to escape. Applicant then grabbed her hair and banged her head against a wall \n10 to 15 times. Four days after the incident, a police officer met with Applicant\u2019s wife and \nread her statement to her. He asked if everything she said in her statement was correct, \nand she affirmed that it was. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied everything in the \nstatement starting with her comment that she woke him up that morning so that he could \ngo to work. (Tr. at 44-45; GE 4 at 23, 29, 40.) \nThe police also took a statement from a neighbor (the Witness), who lived in the \napartment above Applicant\u2019s residence. The Witness reported that she heard an \nargument in Applicant\u2019s apartment and then screams from Applicant\u2019s wife. She believed \nthat her neighbor was in distress. She also heard thumping noises. The Witness decided \nshe should intervene and knocked on the door to Applicant\u2019s apartment and rang the \ndoorbell. Applicant answered the door and reported to her that everything was fine. The \nWitness entered the apartment and found Applicant\u2019s wife sitting on the floor, \u201cshaking \nand crying hysterically.\u201d The Witness returned to her apartment and shortly thereafter, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife appeared at her door. She told the Witness that Applicant hits her often \nand gets upset with her when she tries to wake him up so he can go to work. The Witness \ncalled 911 and reported the domestic violence incident. In an email dated June 27, 2022, \nApplicant\u2019s wife wrote that she called the police. Applicant testified that none of what the \nWitness told the police was correct. The police report described the wife\u2019s demeanor \nwhen they arrived as \u201cupset,\u201d \u201ccrying,\u201d \u201cfearful,\u201d and \u201cnervous,\u201d confirming the Witness\u2019s \nstatement about her condition that morning. Applicant testified that he did not recall his \nwife\u2019s demeanor that morning before he left their home for work. (Tr. at 45-50; GE 4 at \n19, 29, 32; AE G at 1.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife also reported to the police that Applicant had been physically \nviolent with her in the past. She said that he had been physically abusive to her throughout \ntheir 17 months of marriage, which is when she immigrated from Japan and they began \nto cohabitate. She told the police that about once a month he would grab her hair or her \nhead and slam her head into a wall in their apartment. She never sustained serious \ninjuries and was never hospitalized. She did not seek medical attention after the May 25, \n2018 incident, though she did complain about head pain. Applicant denied that he had \never physically abused his wife. (Tr. at 52; GE 4 at 22.) \nAfter her interview by the police, Applicant\u2019s wife requested that she be taken to a \nwomen\u2019s shelter. She asked that the Witness accompany her. The police took her to a \nfacility for placement in a shelter. Later that day, Applicant\u2019s wife obtained a restraining \norder against her husband. Applicant was also ordered to be removed from the couple\u2019s \nresidence. A few months after the May 2018 incident, a more limited protective order was \nentered, and Applicant was allowed to return to his residence. That order was continued \nto at least January 2022, according to the court records, though Applicant testified that \nthe order was lifted. Applicant provided an undated document that reflects the dismissal \nof the restraining order proceeding. (Tr. at 51; GE 4 at 24, 40-47; AE B.) \nApplicant denies that any assault occurred on May 25, 2018, or at any other time. \nHe testified that one morning in May 2018, he had an argument with his wife and the \nargument attracted the attention of their neighbor, the Witness. He claims that the \nallegations against him were made up by his wife at the urgings of the Witness with whom \nApplicant and his wife had an unfriendly relationship. He blames the bad, \u201caggressive\u201d \nrelationship on the neighbor frequently asking him and his wife for financial assistance or \nto borrow personal property. He testified that he declined all such requests. He claimed \nthat as a result of their interactions, Applicant and his wife were \u201con bad terms\u201d with the \nWitness. (Tr. at 19-21.) \nApplicant testified that after the argument with his wife, he went to work. The police \ncame to his home while he was at work. When he returned home, he learned that he had \nbeen \u201cevicted\u201d from his residence. Based upon the police investigative report, the District \nAttorney\u2019s office filed five domestic violence charges against Applicant, including one \nfelony charge. Applicant insisted that the Witness encouraged his wife to make the \ncomplaint against him and that the charges were false.

Her primary language is Japanese \nthough at the time of their marriage she spoke some English. She had studied English \nwhen she was in school and had traveled to the United States in 2015 when she first met \nApplicant. He testified that although he spoke a little Japanese, they communicated in \nEnglish while they were dating and communicating long-distance. Before they had their \nchild in October 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife worked in a restaurant where she \u201chad to\u201d \ncommunicate in English. (Tr. at 21-29, 40-44, 62; GE 1 at 36.) \nGE 5 contains a court record for a proceeding in which Applicant\u2019s wife appeared \nand addressed the court in English on April 24, 2019, less than a year after the incident \nwith Applicant. The court found that an interpreter was not needed because she could \nunderstand and speak English. The initial police report also shows that Applicant\u2019s wife \nwas able to communicate clearly with the police about the incident in a one-on-one \ninterview. As noted, she also confirmed to the police the accuracy of her statement four \ndays later. (GE 4 at 22-24; GE 5 at 6.) \nMitigation \nApplicant\u2019s wife prepared an email, dated June 27, 2022, addressed to the \nprosecutor in her husband\u2019s criminal case. In her communication, she asked for help in \nhaving the case dismissed. At that time, his case was scheduled for trial the next month. \nShe wrote that she regretted calling the police in 2018 \u201cevery day.\u201d She noted that prior \nto the incident, she had suffered a back injury in 2017 and had surgery in March 2018. \nShe commented that she was stressed after her surgery and called the police after an \nargument with her husband. She also wrote that a neighbor \u201ctold me I should call the \npolice.\u201d The record evidence reflects that the prosecutor ultimately offered Applicant an \nagreement that terminated the case on April 25, 2023, after Applicant completed an eight-\nweek anger management/domestic violence course on March 4, 2023. He was also \nrequired to be \u201cbooked.\u201d (Tr. at 23-24, 54-56; AE D; AE G at 1; AE I; AE J.) \nApplicant submitted two letters (and duplicate copies of the letters) of support. The \nletters were dated April 19, 2018, which was before the domestic violence incident and \nthe criminal charges, and April 22, 2019. Applicant worked for this employer from 2017 to \n2019. He has since worked for two other companies. One letter from an executive of his \nformer employer praised Applicant\u2019s excellent customer service. The second letter was \nprepared by Applicant\u2019s former manager. He noted Applicant\u2019s professionalism in the \nhandling of his duties and his care for his wife after she suffered a serious injury.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct      \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30 as follows: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise security concerns under this \nguideline. The following condition is potentially applicable in this case and may be \ndisqualifying: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe record evidence supports the criminal charges filed against Applicant, \nspecifically, that he committed serious and repeated acts of violence against his wife on \nMay 25, 2018. This occurred a little over a year after his marriage to the victim. \nSignificantly, the District Attorney and the City Attorney reviewed the evidence developed \nin the police investigation and concluded that there was probable cause to file criminal \ncharges against Applicant. This evidence satisfies the Government\u2019s burden of proof. The \nGovernment has not alleged Applicant\u2019s OTH Separation as potentially disqualifying \nunder Guideline J, \u00b6 31(e) even though any military discharge or separation \u201cfor reasons \nless than \u2018Honorable\u2019\u201d is potentially disqualifying under that provision of the Directive. As \na result, I have not considered the OTH Separation as disqualifying conduct under \nGuideline J. \nThe evidence of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct shifts the burden to him to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by his conduct. AG \u00b6 32 sets forth four mitigating conditions \nunder Guideline J. The following three mitigating conditions have possible application to \nthe facts in this case: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) has not been established. The record includes evidence that Applicant \nseriously abused his wife at least monthly throughout the first 17 months of their marriage. \nEven though the charged offenses occurred five years ago, such behavior could recur in \nthe future because Applicant provided no convincing evidence to show that he has sought \ntreatment or taken other steps to end his abusive conduct, other than an eight-week \ncourse Applicant agreed to take in exchange for the dismissal of the charges. It is \nimportant to note that until two weeks before the DOHA hearing, Applicant was pending \ntrial on domestic violence charges. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior, his lack of \nacceptance of responsibility, and my negative conclusions about his credibility and \nhonesty (see below) all cast serious doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) has not been established. There is significant, reliable evidence in the \nrecord to support that Applicant committed the criminal acts of strangling his wife and \nbeating her head repeatedly against a wall. Applicant\u2019s denials of the criminal charges \nfiled by both the District Attorney and then the City Attorney lack credibility. In fact, his \ngeneral demeanor throughout the hearing suggested that he was fabricating facts to \nsupport his version of his narrative. Similarly, much of his testimony simply lacked \ncredibility, including his testimony minimizing his conduct that led to his OTH Separation \nfrom the Army Reserve in June 2018, three years after his motorcycle accident in the \nsummer of 2015. Applicant\u2019s attempt to blame the Witness for instigating and fabricating \nthe entire basis for the criminal charges was also not believable, nor was his claim that \nthe Witness was motivated to lie about him due to personal animosity against both \nApplicant and his wife. Also, Applicant\u2019s attempt to argue that his wife had insufficient \nEnglish language skills in May 2018 to avoid being manipulated by the Witness was \ncontrary to the record evidence. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) has not been established. Applicant has denied any criminal behavior. \nHe has not accepted responsibility for his abusive actions against his wife, and therefore \nhas not shown any remorse or taken any steps to avoid similar conduct in the future. \nApplicant received a bachelor\u2019s degree shortly after the May 25, 2018 criminal conduct. \nHis resum\u00e9 reflects that he has taken classes to receive two certifications since 2018. \nOtherwise, there is a paucity of evidence of successful rehabilitation. \nOverall, Applicant has not met his burden to establish mitigation of the Guideline J \nsecurity concerns set forth in the SOR. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                  \n              \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have also weighed the \nrecord evidence in light of the whole-person factors quoted above. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant\u2019s transparently deceptive demeanor and testimony about key facts \nweigh heavily against him as a trustworthy and reliable person. Also, his OTH Separation \nfrom the Army Reserve in 2018 weighs against his worthiness to be entrusted with \nsensitive U.S. national security information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nserious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility \nand a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

It is not clear whether these conditions caused his current \nfinancial indebtedness, since there is nothing else in the record that explains why he is \nexcessively delinquently indebted. \nApplicant stated that he intends to work with the creditors in good faith and \nestablish payment arrangements as soon as possible. He failed to submit any evidence \nin mitigation. There is nothing more in the record to show that he has taken any action \ntoward resolving his debts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has incurred delinquent debts totaling approximately $21,000. These \naccounts have been charged off by the creditors. The evidence is sufficient to raise the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant is delinquently indebted to each of the three creditors set forth in the \nSOR. He has failed to provide any evidence in mitigation. He stated that he intends to \nwork with the creditors in good faith to establish payment arrangements as soon as \npossible. There is no evidence to show that he has contacted the creditor, set up an \nagreeable payment arrangement, or otherwise resolved the debts. He gives no reason \nor excuse for his excessive indebtedness. \nHe has known for some time that his \nfinancial delinquencies and numerous unpaid bills pose a threat to his security \nclearance eligibility, and he has done nothing to resolve the issue. His debts remain \ndelinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long reflects a pattern of unreliability, \nuntrustworthiness, and poor judgment. \nApplicant fails to meet the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified information. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case.

On April 1, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) and I \n(Psychological Conditions). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated response (Answer), and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 2, 2022.

The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Notice of Hearing on September 12, 2022, scheduling the case to be heard via \nvideo teleconference on October 4, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered five \ndocuments, identified as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. I admitted GE 1 and 3 \nthrough 5 without objection. Applicant objected to GE 2, a psychological evaluation report \nprepared at the request of the CAF. I overruled his objection and admitted the document \ninto evidence. Applicant testified on his own behalf, but offered no documentary evidence. \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 12, 2022. (Tr. at 12-19.) \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 65 years old. He has married four times. His first three marriages \nended in divorce. He and his first wife had two children. Applicant\u2019s adult son died in an \naccident in 2015. His other child is an adult. Applicant and his fourth wife married in 2016. \nHe graduated from high school and earned an Associate\u2019s degree. He served in the U.S. \nNavy for four years and was honorably discharged in 1979 with a disability. Applicant has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor as a technician since July 2019 and seeks to \nobtain national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. The e-QIP is his first application for a clearance. In 2014 the Defense \nDepartment granted Applicant eligibility to receive a Common Access Card. (Tr. at 22-25, \n27, 39; GE 1 at 7, 12, 13, 24, 26-30, 37-38.) \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Involvement \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance \nbecause he has used marijuana since 2015 and intends to continue to do so in the future \n(SOR 1.a and 1.b). The Government further alleges that a psychologist (the Psychologist) \nwho conducted a psychological evaluation diagnosed Applicant as having Unspecified \nCannabis-Related Disorder and concluded that his condition could pose a risk to his \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified information at this time (SOR \n1.c). In his Answer Applicant admits the first two SOR allegations and provides some \nadditional information. He denies the third allegation stating that he does not meet the \ncriteria of the diagnosis provided by the Psychologist and questions whether the \nPsychologist is competent. \nApplicant smoked marijuana before his children were born in the mid-to-late \n1980\u2019s. As a parent he decided to stop using illegal drugs to set an appropriate example. \nIn 2015 after the death of his son, Applicant began using edibles containing marijuana or \nTHC (Edibles). Applicant was suffering severely from grief. He was having difficulty \nsleeping. A doctor diagnosed that Applicant was experiencing post-traumatic stress \ndisorder (PTSD) and provided him with a medical marijuana card that permitted him to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npurchase marijuana, including Edibles with THC, to help him with his PTSD. He uses \nEdibles because they gave him some relief from his \u201cemotional trauma\u201d and help him \nsleep. He presently uses them three or four nights per week. The anniversary of his son\u2019s \ndeath was during the period just before the hearing, and he used Edibles more frequently \nto help him get through a period he described as \u201chell.\u201d He only takes Edibles after he \nexperiences something that triggers his intense feeling of grief. He acknowledged that he \nexperiences triggers every day, even \u201c24/7.\u201d He never takes Edibles during the day. He \nis opposed to any prescription drugs that are typically used to reduce anxiety or \ndepression. He \u201cavoid[s] them like the plague.\u201d He intends to continue using Edibles in \nthe future because \u201cthe pain never goes away.\u201d He acknowledged that he is aware that \nTHC is an illegal drug under Federal law. He views his only alternative to THC is the use \nof opioids, which he dislikes because they are addictive. (Tr. at 28- 31, 39-45.) \nApplicant candidly testified that he uses Edibles because without them he will \u201ccry \nhimself to sleep every night.\u201d He suffers from sadness and depression every day, but only \nuses the Edibles at night because they help him sleep. He finds it overwhelming to deal \nwith so much grief every day. His plan for the future is to continue focusing on his work, \nwhich he asserts he performs well. He will also continue surfing on the weekends and \nafter work. When he needs the relief provided by the Edibles, he will continue to take \nthem to help him sleep. He commented that he will \u201cnot be a free man until the day I die. \nThere is no resolution.\u201d (Tr. at 46-49.) \nApplicant disagrees with the Psychologist\u2019s evaluation of his condition because he \ndoes not believe he is dependent on marijuana or THC (collectively, THC). He views the \nPsychologist\u2019s diagnosis of Unspecified Cannabis-Related Disorder as concluding that \nApplicant is dependent on THC. Applicant testified about his recent experience of taking \na two-week vacation with his wife when he could not travel with Edibles to other states. \nDuring that vacation, he was comfortable not using Edibles because there were few \nsituations that triggered intense grief. He experiences those triggers regularly when he is \nat home where he keeps his son\u2019s ashes. He acknowledged that the Psychologist\u2019s \nconclusion that Applicant is reliant on THC to stabilize his mood is \u201c60% accurate.\u201d He \nengages in other activities to remain calm, like surfing. (Tr. at 31-33, 43.) \nParagraph 2 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security \nclearance because he has a psychological condition that raises security concerns. \nSpecifically, the SOR alleges the Psychologist gave Applicant a guarded prognosis due \nto Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) that is untreated other than a prescription for \nmarijuana. In his Answer Applicant denies this allegation and provides additional \ninformation and opinions regarding his view that the Psychologist\u2019s opinion is erroneous. \nAt the hearing Applicant acknowledged that he is not currently participating in any \ntreatment. He does not find grief counseling useful. He participated in grief counseling for \ntwo years after his son\u2019s death and found that discussions about the seven stages of grief \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto be repetitive and unhelpful. He believes that \u201cnothing resolves the grief of a lost child. \nNothing.\u201d He believes that there are no answers. (Tr. at 34-36.) \nThe Psychologist\u2019s report, dated January 6, 2022, is part of the record. In his \nreport, the Psychologist noted that three counselors have treated Applicant in the past \nand that Applicant advised that he had been diagnosed with PTSD. Applicant has only \nreceived treatment during a six-month period. The Psychologist\u2019s test results confirmed \nthis diagnosis. He also affirmed a prior diagnosis of Applicant of Unspecified Cannabis-\nRelated Disorder. The Psychologist gave Applicant a \u201cguarded\u201d diagnosis. He wrote that \nApplicant \u201cseems reliant on the substance [THC] to maintain a stable mood.\u201d His ultimate \nconclusion was that Applicant\u2019s \u201cPTSD and marijuana use could pose a significant risk to \nhis judgment, reliability or trustworthiness concerning classified information at the present \ntime.\u201d (GE 2 at 8-9.) \nMitigation \nApplicant honorably served in the Navy for four years and was discharged with a \ndisability. In 2015 he suffered the tragic loss of his only son with whom he was very close. \nSeven years later he continues to grieve, kissing the urn holding his son\u2019s ashes before \nhe retires for the night. He sleeps poorly and thinks of his son and the loss of his son \nevery day. He is opposed to using prescription medications to treat his suffering and \nstrongly believes that his use of Edibles is the best treatment option. He complied with \nthe laws of his state to obtain a prescription authorizing him to purchase and use Edibles. \nHe believes that he would be a greater risk to national security if he used opioids to \nmanage his PTSD and grief. He describes his honesty as his strength and his fault, noting \nthat he could have lied in his e-QIP and his use of Edibles would never have become an \nissue. (Tr. at 49.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 25 describes four conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed social worker) of \nsubstance use disorder; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, and his detailed testimony regarding his \nhistory of using Edibles and his intent to continue to do so, as well as the Psychologist\u2019s \nreport, establish all of the above disqualifying conditions and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate the security concerns raised by his conduct. \nThe guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug involvement: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Applicant illegal drug use is current, frequent and is \nlikely to recur. Also his behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is only partially established. It is arguable that Applicant suffers from a \nsevere and prolonged mental illness during and that a doctor gave him a medical \nmarijuana card that permitted him to legally purchase Edibles under the law of his state \nof residence. That type of drug is not, however, within the normally accepted meaning of \nthe term \u201cprescription drugs\u201d under this mitigating condition. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s use of \nEdibles has not ceased. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2 - Guideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27 as follows: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counselling. \nAG \u00b6 28 describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nThe Psychologist\u2019s report establishes the above condition and shifts the burden of \nproof to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised by the report. AG \u00b6 29 lists the \nfollowing five conditions under Guideline I that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom the opinions of the mental health provider in the record evidence: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a \nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the above mitigating conditions have been established by the facts of this \ncase. Applicant\u2019s \u201ctreatment plan\u201d involves the use of a controlled substance that is not \nlegal under Federal law. Accordingly, the treatment plan cannot be viewed under Federal \nlaw as a legitimate plan. Applicant is not currently participating in a counseling or a \ntreatment plan utilizing prescription drugs that are legal under Federal law. In addition, \nhis current diagnosis is guarded. Applicant has not submitted a recent opinion of a duly \nqualified medical profession to rebut the recent opinion of the Psychologist. Applicant\u2019s \npsychological condition is not temporary or resolved, and according to the Psychologist, \nApplicant continues to show indications of emotional instability. Moreover, his \npsychological condition can be expected to continue in the future unless he agrees to \nparticipate in appropriate counseling and a legal treatment plan, including taking drugs \nthat are prescribed for his condition and are lawful under Federal law. Paragraph 2 of the \nSOR is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case, including the whole-person \nfactors quoted above. Applicant has to face daily a significant emotional problem due to \nthe sudden and premature death of his son. He suffers greatly from the emotional trauma \narising from this tragedy. He has not, however, successfully confronted his condition, and \nhe is not under the treatment of mental health professionals. He has not provided \nsatisfactory evidence in mitigation of the security concerns raised by his continued use of \nEdibles to maintain a degree of emotional stability. He continues to suffer from a mental \nhealth condition that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information at the present time. Overall, the record \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence raises serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for \nnational security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. 55) \nThe SOR alleges the following financial concerns: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a bank filed a judgment in September 2021 against Applicant \nfor about $14,819. The debt resulted from a car loan which Applicant\u2019s spouse obtained \nto purchase a new vehicle in 2017. (Tr. 32; SOR response) The monthly payment was \n$400.

The debt \nresulted from a car loan which Applicant obtained in 2017 to purchase a new sports car. \n(Tr. 30-31, 53-54; SOR response) The monthly payment was $780. (Tr. 31) He \ncharacterized the purchase of the sports car as a \u201cstupid\u201d decision; however, he learned \nfrom it and purchased an inexpensive used vehicle as a replacement after the sports car \nwas repossessed. (Tr. 53) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for about $10,413. He obtained \na $10,000 personal loan. (Tr. 39) He paid about $4,000 in interest; however, in the \nsummer of 2018, he stopped making payments.

I have learned from that\nmistake as I mentioned and now have a much more affordable car payment\nthat will be paid off within the next year. I pay my bills on time and live within\nmy means. It was my mistake to let my ex-wife control our finances as I\nhave much better control over it. If I am given the opportunity to hold my\nclearance by the time my next investigation is due[,] I will be completely\ndebt free.

[AE C]  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d  \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He and his spouse were \nunemployed or underemployed or both. He and his spouse moved to a different state. His \nspouse was injured and on disability. He was separated and then divorced from his \nspouse. These circumstances were partially or fully beyond their control and adversely \naffected his finances. He did not provide sufficient details to assess the magnitude of the \nadverse effect on his overall finances or his efforts to make progress resolving the \ndelinquent accounts. \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in \npart, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider \nwhether applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 \n(App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd.

He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with the SOR creditors over the years or that he worked \ndiligently to timely pay his debts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in March 2016, and his \nnonpriority unsecured debts were discharged in about June 2016. He was unemployed \nfrom July 2015 to January 2016, and his spouse was not employed outside their home. \nThey moved to a different state, which enabled his spouse to find employment in \nDecember 2015. His spouse\u2019s annual pay was about $30,000. When he went to a \nbankruptcy attorney, his attorney told him to stop paying his creditors. The debts \ndischarged through the bankruptcy totaled about $93,000, and they consisted mostly of \ncar loans for repossessed vehicles and credit card debts. Bankruptcy is a legally \nauthorized means for resolving debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) applies to this bankruptcy, and SOR \u00b6 \n1.h is mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished by a state tax authority for \nabout $5,585. His spouse prepared their tax returns. He said the state tax debt was paid \nthrough a voluntary garnishment of his income, and he made the final payment of $50 in \nJuly 2023. This debt is resolved. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant has owed federal income taxes since 2019 \nbecause his spouse received a settlement in 2018, and federal income taxes were not \nwithheld from the settlement. He described his federal income tax debt during his OPM \ninterview. He owes the IRS about $2,000 for TY 2022. He did not provide any \ncorrespondence from the IRS or IRS tax transcripts showing his federal income tax debt \nwas or is in an established payment plan. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. \n26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an \nSOR may be considered stating: \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \nId.

Three SOR debts are less than $1,000 each. He did \nnot provide any documentation showing his attempts to address these three debts. Under \nall the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old investigator who has worked for his current employer \nsince September 2018. He served in the Air Force from August 7, 2007, to January 18, \n2013. He was a senior airman when he received an honorable discharge from the Air \nForce. He received a 60 percent disability rating from the VA, which results in a $1,600 \nmonthly payment from the VA. His VA disability rating was increased from 40 percent to \n60 percent in August or September 2022. His gross income is about $69,000, which is \nnear the national average. \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. He \nprovided multiple reasons for his financial difficulties. He acted reasonably when he filed \nfor bankruptcy in March 2016 and when he agreed to a voluntary garnishment of his pay \nto address his state income tax debt. He has provided contributions to his employer and \nthe national defense. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is detailed in the financial \nconsiderations section, supra, and this evidence is more substantial at this time than the \nevidence of mitigation. Applicant did not establish that he was unable to make greater \nprogress sooner resolving his delinquent debts. He did not take sufficient actions to \nprovide documented evidence of his actions to address his federal income tax debt. His \nfailure to take prudent, responsible, good-faith actions raise unmitigated questions about \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

Applicant served in the U.S. Navy for 20 years and retired honorably in January 2015 as a member of the Submarine Force as an Auxiliaryman (E-6). He held a security clearance while in the Navy.

Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR identified five past-due or charged-off debts owed by Applicant totaling about $40,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations and commented that he has paid one of the debts. He also argued that three of the debts will be removed from his credit report in 2023 or 2024 and a fourth is \u201cclosed.\u201d The existence and amounts of all five debts is supported by Applicant\u2019s admissions in the Answer and by credit reports in the record, dated January 11, 2023; October 13, 2021; and March 12, 2021.

(Tr. at 16-20.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old, married, and has four children and three stepchildren. \nFour of the children live with Applicant and their mother. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy \nfor 20 years and retired honorably in January 2015 as a member of the Submarine Force \nas an Auxiliaryman (E-6). He held a security clearance while in the Navy.

(Answer; GE 2, GE 3, GE 4.) \nApplicant first started to experience financial problems in about 2015 and the year \nor so after his Navy retirement. He was unemployed for a period and in November 2015, \nhe had a bad motorcycle accident that kept him from working for a period. He then had \nmore periods of unemployment and underemployment. He defaulted on all of the SOR \ndebts during the first two years following his retirement. (Tr. at 30-31, 49-53: GE 1 at \nSection 13A, 26.) \nApplicant testified that he and his wife presently have monthly take-home pay of \nabout $9,700. In addition, he has monthly retirement benefits from the Navy of about \n$1,500 and VA disability benefits of about $160. Their total net monthly income is over \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$11,000. Based upon his off-the-cuff calculations of his monthly expenses, he believes \nhe has on average about $2,000 left over at the end of every month. He presently has \nabout $1,000 in savings. At one time, he had about $8,000 in savings, but it has been \nreduced recently due to some emergency expenses and because he loaned money to a \nfamily member who lost his job. In light of his savings history, Applicant\u2019s estimated net \nmonthly remainder appears to be based upon an incomplete listing of his monthly \nexpenses. (Tr. at 33-46, 59.) \nApplicant never contributed to a Thrift Savings Plan account when he was a \nservicemember. He does not contribute to his current employer\u2019s retirement account. (Tr. \nat 59-60.) \nThe current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows: \n1.a. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $14,638. The creditor that \ncharged off this credit-card account is the same creditor that charged off the debts listed \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. He was able to keep these accounts current until he retired, but \nwithout stable new employment, his savings alone were not enough to pay his debts. The \ncreditor has transferred these three debts to a collection agency. In the week or so prior \nto the hearing, Applicant tried to contact the agency to discuss settlement options, but he \nhas not been successful in reaching anyone. He wants to slowly \u201cchip away\u201d at these \nthree debts when he is able to do so. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 54-60; GE 3 at 2; \nGE 4 at 2.) \n1.b. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $9,173. Applicant took \nout this loan to purchase a motorcycle. The motorcycle is the same one that was involved \nin an accident in November 2015. It was a total loss. See discussion in SOR \u00b6 1.a, above. \nThis debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 60-62; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3.) \n1.c. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $5,106. This debt is for \nan auto loan that Applicant could not afford after his retirement. The car was repossessed. \nSee discussion in SOR \u00b6 1.a, above. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; GE 2 at 4; \nGE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3.) \n1.d. Personal Loan Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $10,792. Applicant \nopened this account when he was on active duty in the Navy. He needed the credit to pay \nfor travel expenses to see his mother, who had suffered a heart attack. He subsequently \nretired and had little income to repay this loan. In November 2015, after his retirement, \nhe also had medical expenses due to a motorcycle accident. He was unable to work for \nan extended period. He also incurred significant medical bills. This debt is not resolved. \n(Tr. at 49- 52; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 3.) \n1.e. Cellular Phone Account in Collection in the Amount of $794.

The debt only appears on \nthe Government\u2019s earliest credit report, dated March 12, 2021 (GE 4). That credit report \nreflects the debt has been placed for collection. Based upon the totality of the record, I \nfind that this debt is resolved. (Tr. at 46-48; GE 4 at 3.) \nMitigation \nAccording to the credit reports in the record, Applicant has paid and closed two \ndelinquent accounts with debts totaling $2,000, (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 4-5). Those debts \nwere not alleged in the SOR. He has also paid the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.e. His debt-\nresolution strategy is to pay the smaller debts first, including the debt alleged at SOR 1.e \nand the two debts that were not listed in the SOR, and then as his finances permit, start \npaying down the larger debts. He testified that the experience of discussing all of his debts \nin a hearing was a \u201csobering\u201d experience. He said that he wants to \u201cchip away\u201d at his \ndebts, but he acknowledged that it is difficult to do that with a large family creating a lot \nof competing financial priorities. Applicant\u2019s finances today are much more stable than \nthey were during the 2015-to-2017 period. He has not incurred any delinquent debts since \nhe defaulted on the last of the five SOR debts in 2015 or 2016. (Tr.at 53-64.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant owed approximately $40,000 for five past-due debts, as of the date the \nSOR was issued. These facts render the foregoing disqualifying conditions applicable and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. Guideline F includes the following \nfour conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial delinquencies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) are only partially established. Applicant\u2019s debts arose \nfollowing his retirement from the Navy when he was unemployed for a period and then \nwas unable to work due to injuries he sustained in a motorcycle accident. Applicant\u2019s \ninitial difficulty finding employment after his retirement is a circumstance largely beyond \nhis control, as was his loss of income after his accident. Since August 2018, he and his \nwife have obtained financial stability and are now earning significant net monthly incomes. \nIt cannot be concluded, however, that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances \nin addressing his past delinquencies. Several years have passed since 2018. It was only \na week before the hearing that Applicant sought to contact the collection agency holding \nthree of the SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s behavior casts doubts of his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant has not sought or received any financial \ncounseling. He has a theoretical concept for repaying his debts, starting with the smallest \ndebts and working up to the largest. In about July 2021, he paid one SOR debt before the \nSOR was even issued. At some point before the SOR was issued in April 2022, he paid \ntwo other small debts. Since those payments some time ago, Applicant has not taken any \nserious steps to address his four remaining SOR debts. Accordingly, there are no clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant has only taken the first of many steps \nnecessary to implement a plan to repay his delinquent debts. Accordingly, he has not \ninitiated and is not adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. I have given substantial weight to Applicant\u2019s 20 years of service in the Navy \nand his honorable retirement. I have also credited his integrity and sincerity with which he \nresponded to the questions asked at the hearing. It is clear that he suffered a big setback \nin his financial stability after retiring from the Navy and especially after his accident \ndisabled him and he could not work for a substantial period of time. I have also weighed \nthe fact that he has not become further indebted since 2017 and that his current monthly \nfinances are stable, even with his large family to house, feed, and provide care. All of \nthese positive traits, however, are outweighed by the fact that he has not taken any \nsignificant steps to address his past delinquent debts starting with seeking the advice of \na financial counselor who can help him budget his sizable monthly family income and set \naside funds every month so that he can begin to pay down his remaining four debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance at this time. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.
