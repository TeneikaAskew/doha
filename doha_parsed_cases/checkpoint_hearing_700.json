He made some positive \nsteps towards rehabilitation; however, security concerns under Guideline G (alcohol \nconsumption) are not mitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.            \n \nStatement of the Case \n \n \nOn September 30, 2015, Applicant completed and signed a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) or security clearance application (SCA). (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On September 10, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued an SOR to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, February 20, 1960; DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), January 2, 1992; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. The SOR set forth security concerns arising under \nGuideline G. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \n \nOn October 12, 2018, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3) On January 9, 2019, Department Counsel was ready to \nproceed. On January 25, 2019, the case was assigned to me. On March 11, 2019, the \n\n \n2 \n                                         \n \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for March 25, 2019. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled; however, \nApplicant objected because he did not have 15 days of notice of the date, time, and \nlocation of the hearing. The hearing was terminated, and a new hearing was scheduled. \nOn March 29, 2019, the hearing was scheduled for May 2, 2019. The second hearing was \nheld as scheduled using video teleconference.    \n  \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered four exhibits; Applicant offered \nfive exhibits; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were admitted into \nevidence. (Tr. 11-14, 69; GE 1-4; Applicant Exhibit (AE) A-E) On May 15, 2019, DOHA \nreceived a copy of the hearing transcript. The record closed on May 16, 2019.

(Tr. 53) He paid a $300 \nfine. (Tr. 53)   \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges in about January 2004, Applicant was charged with Assault and \nDisorderly Conduct, and Applicant consumed alcohol before his arrest. Applicant was at \na party consuming alcohol, and he allowed someone to borrow his car. (Tr. 54) An \naccident involving Applicant\u2019s vehicle occurred within Applicant\u2019s view, and he went to the \nlocation of the accident. (Tr-54-55) The police arrived, and Applicant was arrested. (Tr. \n54-55) Applicant could not remember what he did or why he was arrested. (Tr. 54-55) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges in about December 2003, Applicant was charged with \nIntoxication and Disorderly Conduct. Applicant drank 8 to 12 beers, and he was \nintoxicated.

(Tr. 59-60; SOR response) \n \nIn 2004, Applicant received an alcohol assessment. (Tr. 64) He did not receive a \ndiagnosis of an alcohol-use disorder or alcohol dependence. (Tr. 64) There was no \nrecommendation that he receive alcohol-related counseling or therapy. (Tr. 62-63)  \n \nApplicant has not been inside of a bar since 2017. (Tr. 60) The only time he \nconsumed alcohol after he received the SOR was when he and his spouse split a bottle \nof wine on December 31, 2018. (Tr. 62-63) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \n                                            \n3 In 2002, Applicant\u2019s security clearance was denied because he failed to disclose his arrest for \npossession of drug paraphernalia on his security clearance application. (Tr. 65, 73) He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. No adverse inference is made because of the denial of his security clearance 16 years \nago. \n\n \n5 \n                                         \n \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \napplicant\u2019s personal or professional history that may disqualify the applicant for eligibility \nfor access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, \n1996). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \n \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \n  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions under the alcohol consumption guideline that could raise \na security concern and may be disqualifying including: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n \n(b) alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or duty in \nan intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or jeopardizing the \n\n \n6 \n                                         \n \nwelfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder; and \n \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, evaluation, \ntreatment, or abstinence.  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) apply. The police arrested Applicant eight times from August \n2000 to February 2017 for behavior related to his alcohol consumption. On several \noccasions, he consumed more than five beers. The record establishes that he engaged \nin binge-alcohol consumption to the extent of impaired judgment.4  \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n                                            \n4 \u201cBinge drinking is the most common pattern of excessive alcohol use in the United States.\u201d See \nthe Center for Disease Control website, (stating \u201cThe National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \ndefines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to \n0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when \nwomen consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours.\u201d), https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/fact-sheets/binge-\ndrinking.htm. There are other definitions of \u201cbinge alcohol consumption\u201d that involve different alcohol-\nconsumption amounts and patterns. \n\n \n7 \n                                         \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n  \n \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there was a fairly \nlengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at \n3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); \nISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-\n04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial of security clearance for Applicant with \nalcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior to hearing). For example, in ISCR \nCase No. 05-16753 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Aug. 2, 2007) the Appeal Board reversed the \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance and noted, \u201cThat Applicant continued to drink \neven after his second alcohol-related arrest vitiates the Judge\u2019s application of MC 3.\u201d   \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-10019 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2007), the Appeal Board \nreversed an administrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance to an applicant (AB) where AB \nhad several alcohol-related legal problems. However, AB\u2019s most recent DUI was in 2000, \nsix years before an administrative judge decided AB\u2019s case. AB had reduced his alcohol \nconsumption, but still drank alcohol to intoxication, and sometimes drank alcohol (not to \nintoxication) before driving. The Appeal Board determined that AB\u2019s continued alcohol \nconsumption was not responsible, and the grant of AB\u2019s clearance was arbitrary and \ncapricious. See also ISCR Case No. 04-12916 at 2-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2007) (involving \ncase with most recent alcohol-related incident three years before hearing, and reversing \nadministrative judge\u2019s grant of a clearance). \n \nApplicant presented evidence supporting mitigation of alcohol-consumption \nconcerns. Applicant has never been diagnosed with an alcohol-use disorder or alcohol \ndependence. He ended his alcohol consumption when the received the SOR on \nSeptember 10, 2018, except for drinking part of a bottle of wine with his wife on December \n31, 2018. He does not intend to drink alcohol in the future. He has never been arrested \nfor an alcohol-relating driving offense. \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. The police arrested Applicant \neight times from August 2000 to February 2017 for behavior related to his alcohol \nconsumption. He engaged in binge-alcohol consumption on several occasions that led to \nhis arrest for being disrespectful to police. He abstained from alcohol consumption for \nless than six months. I have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on \nalcohol consumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. I have lingering \ndoubts and concerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment pertaining to his history of alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption security \nconcerns are not mitigated.  \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n                                         \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n     \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. \u201cIn evaluating an applicant\u2019s case, a \nJudge must carefully consider the record as a whole. This includes not only considering the \nextent to which an applicant\u2019s circumstances raise concerns about his or her reliability but \nalso giving fair consideration of the applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-\n09900 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-00424 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. \n20, 2016)). My comments under Guideline G are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant \nadditional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor who has been \nemployed as an engineering analyst for his current employer since 2015.  He has been \nemployed in the aerospace industry for 16 years. His annual salary is $85,000. In 2018, \nhe received several awards from his employer. In 2018, he received a U.S. patent. He \ncompleted numerous work-related training courses. \n \nThe police arrested Applicant eight times from August 2000 to February 2017 for \nbehavior related to his alcohol consumption. His current abstinence from alcohol \nconsumption is for less than six months before his hearing. Based on these factors, I have \nlingering doubts and concerns about Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. A significant probability of alcohol-related judgment errors in the future \ncontinues to exist, and this possibility of future judgment errors raises ongoing questions \nabout his reliability and trustworthiness.

Dorsey, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nBENSON, Pamela C., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n Statement of the Case \nOn April 12, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn June 29, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information; \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines issued by the Director of National \nIntelligence, effective within the DOD on or after June 8, 2017.1 \n1 GE 1, 3. \n02/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 20, 2018. He admitted three of the SOR \nallegations, (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.g), and he denied the others, (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f). \nHe submitted documents with his response to the SOR. Applicant requested that his \ncase be decided by an administrative judge on the written record in lieu of a hearing.2  \n \n \nOn August 24, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six items, \nwas mailed to Applicant on August 27, 2018. The FORM notified Applicant that he had \nan opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation within 45 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant received the FORM on \nSeptember 4, 2018, and he provided a written explanation and additional documents in \nhis response to the FORM. I labeled his documents as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A-D, \nwhich were admitted into evidence. Applicant did not object to Items 1 through 6, which \nI marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, and admitted into evidence. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on December 13, \n2018. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 34 years old. He has been \nemployed full time with a Federal contractor since January 2018. His wife is not \ncurrently employed, and his family is living on his income. He had previously been \nemployed by the same Federal contractor in another state from January 2015 to \napproximately January 2018. Applicant was unemployed from June 2009 to February \n2010. He earned an Associate's degree in 2010, and he received certification as an \nelectrician in 2015. He married in 2007 and has one daughter, age five. He earned two \nhonorable discharges with the U.S. Air Force in 2009, and in 2016 from the U.S. Air \nForce Reserve.3  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR alleges seven delinquent accounts totaling approximately $87,887, \nwhich are supported by credit reports submitted by the Government.4 Applicant did not \ndisclose any adverse financial information on his SCA. He has five unpaid consumer \ndebts, a medical account referred for collection, and delinquent Federal taxes owed for \ntax year 2016. In his response to the SOR, Applicant said that he was disputing the \ndelinquent accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e, pursuant to the Fair Debt \nCollection Practices Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Applicant believed the \ncreditor could not provide a valid contract, promissory note, proof or validation of the \nalleged debt, and therefore, he could not be held responsible for the debt. Applicant \n                                                          \n2 GE 2. \n \n3 GE 3. \n \n4 GE 5, 6, 7, 8. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nalso claimed that one of the alleged debts is fraudulent. (SOR \u00b6 1.f.) The record \nestablishes the status of Applicant\u2019s accounts as follows:  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges an account referred for collection in the approximate amount \nof $60,639. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this debt and provided letters \nfrom the collection agency related to the debt. These letters addressed Applicant's \ndispute and noted that his file was now closed and a request was submitted to the credit \nreporting agencies to have his account removed. This debt is resolved.  [Not needed \nsince you find the documentation sufficient to resolve the debt.  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a consumer charge account referred for collection in the amount of \n$6,847. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted this account, but he did not \nbelieve the amount was correct. He did not provide any documentation to support this \nclaim. He admitted that he had not made any payments on this account. In response to \nthe FORM, Applicant admitted that he had just initiated contact with the creditor to see if \na settlement agreement could be reached. He provided no corroborating \ndocumentation. This debt has not been resolved.5 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a jewelry account charged off in the amount of $4,916. In his \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted this account, but he said this account became \ndelinquent during his unemployment in August 2011. The credit report showed that the \naccount became delinquent in November 2015.6 In addition, the SCA also showed that \nApplicant was unemployed from June 2009 to February 2010. As of August 2011, he \nwas employed part time in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.7 In response to the FORM, \nApplicant admitted that he had just initiated contact with the creditor to see if a \nsettlement agreement could be reached. He provided no corroborating documentation.  \nThis debt has not been resolved.8 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a consumer credit account referred for collection in the \namount of $1,786. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this debt and said that \nhe was disputing the debt pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and the \nFair Credit Reporting Act. He did not provide any explanation for the dispute or provide \nsupporting documentation. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that the credit \nbureaus have informed him that the account was verified and he was obligated to pay it. \nApplicant is in contact with a law firm to see if a settlement agreement can be reached. \nHe provided no corroborating documentation. This debt has not been resolved.9 \n \n                                                          \n5 AE A. \n \n6 GE 5. \n \n7 GE 3. \n \n8 AE A. \n \n9 AE A. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a consumer credit account referred for collection in the \namount of $1,289. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this debt and said that \nhe was disputing it. He did not provide any explanation for the dispute or provide \nsupporting documentation. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that the credit \nbureaus have informed him that the account was verified and he was obligated to pay it. \nApplicant is in contact with a law firm to see if a settlement agreement can be reached. \nThere is no supporting evidence of any effort by Applicant to repay, settle, or resolve \nthis account. This debt has not been resolved.10 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a medical account referred for collection in the amount of \n$810. In his response to the SOR, Applicant denied this account and listed that the \naccount was fraudulent. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he has taken \nmeasures to have the medical account removed from his credit report after he \ndiscovered the medical account was opened in another state (State 2) Applicant lives in \nState 1. He denied living in State 2, therefore, he believed it was a fraudulent account.  \n \n \n \nHowever, Applicant's spouse received military orders to report to State 2 while \nApplicant remained in State 1, as he said in his SOR response. In his SCA, Applicant, \ndisclosed dates of residence in State 2. He provided a copy of his dispute with the credit \nbureaus and a copy of a fraud alert that he had filed. Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation regarding communications he may have made with the medical provider \nto verify the account. His assertion that it is fraudulent, without verifying documentation, \nis not enough to show that this account is in fact fraudulent, especially considering his \nconnections with the state where the account was opened. This account has not been \nresolved.11 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a Federal tax debt for tax year 2016 in the amount of $11,600. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted this tax debt and said that he had \nenrolled in an installment agreement. He had been making monthly payments to the \nIRS. He did not provide supporting documentation of when he entered into the \ninstallment agreement, provide a history of monthly payments made in accordance with \nthe installment agreement, or disclose the current amount of the tax debt.  \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant said that he had \"recently\" elected to \nparticipate in the installment agreement and provided documentation from the IRS. The \nletter from the IRS showed that on August 21, 2018, Applicant had inquired about \nresolution of his delinquent Federal taxes for both tax year 2016, and tax year 2017, \nwhich was not alleged. The IRS stated that a revised installment agreement required \nApplicant to make $200 monthly payments beginning on September 28, 2018. Applicant \ndid not provide any documentation of any payments he has made to the IRS, or the \ncurrent amount of his federal tax debt.  \n \n                                                          \n10 Id. \n \n11 AE A, C, D. \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nApplicant mentioned in his response to the FORM that the reason for him owing \ntaxes for 2016 was due to him filing under the \"Married Filing Separate\" criteria. He has \nnever had to pay taxes in the past, so he believed he must have made an error on the \ntax return. Applicant did not provide any explanation why he also owed taxes for 2017, \nas noted in his attached documentation.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 an \u201capplicant is responsible \nfor presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nfacts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the ultimate \nburden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has approximately $87,887 of delinquent debt, to include Federal \ntaxes, that is unpaid and unresolved, as shown on his credit reports. In ISCR Case No. \n08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board explained: \n \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the \nburden shifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not \nresponsible for the debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n  \n \nThere is insufficient evidence to apply any of the mitigating conditions. Applicant \ndisputed four of the seven delinquent accounts, (SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f.), but he \ndid not provide a valid explanation for his disputes, and he did not provide any \nsupporting documentation to show that his disputes with the original creditors were \nvalid. He did not provide proof of his communication with the original creditor to \ndetermine whether a medical service account was in fact fraudulent. Applicant admitted \nresponsibility for the other three debts, but he failed to provide any evidence to show \nthat he is paying, resolving, or has settled any of those debts, to include any payments \nhe has made for delinquent 2016 taxes. There is no evidence to show Applicant \nreceived financial counseling or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances in \ndealing with his creditors.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant is credited with mitigating the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He consistently \ndenied knowledge of this debt, and the only evidence that he owed it is a credit report. \nHe disputed the debt, and it is removed from his credit report.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a position of trust with the Government. An applicant is \nnot required to be debt-free, but is required to manage his finances to meet his financial \nobligations. \n \n \nAside from the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant failed to provide supporting \ndocumentation to mitigate his delinquent accounts, and he failed to demonstrate that he \nacted reasonably under the circumstances in dealing with his creditors. There is no \nshowing by Applicant of any effort to pay, legitimately dispute, or otherwise resolve the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.g. Applicant has not provided a financial plan or a \ndetailed budget of his current financial circumstances. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment, reliability as well as eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Because \nprotection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications, any \n\n \n9 \n \n \nunresolved doubts must be resolved against the granting of eligibility to classified \ninformation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n                \n \n            \n \n \n \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 58 years old and divorced. He holds the position of pilot and is employed with a defense contractor. He is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that Applicant has filed for two bankruptcies, and has an outstanding tax lien entered against him in the amount of $25,799. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated March 13, 2018, and August 27, 2018, confirm the tax lien. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.) Applicant attributes his financial problems to a series of unfortunate events that he states will not recur. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) Applicant started working for his current employer in September 2008. He started as a pilot and over time was promoted to Lead Pilot, Chief Pilot, and is now Senior Pilot, serving as an instructor Pilot.

The case was assigned to me on April 23, 2019.  The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of hearing on April 24, 2019, and the \nhearing was convened as scheduled on June 4, 2019.  The Government offered six \nexhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted without \nobjection. The Applicant offered eight exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A \nthrough H, which were admitted without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf.  \nThe record remained open until close of business on June 11, 2019, to allow the \nApplicant the opportunity to provide additional supporting documentation.  Applicant \n\n \n2 \n \nsubmitted three Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits \nI, J and K, which were admitted without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on June 17, 2019. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 58 years old and divorced.  He holds the position of pilot and is \nemployed with a defense contractor.  He is applying for a security clearance in \nconnection with his employment.   \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has filed for two bankruptcies, and has an \noutstanding tax lien entered against him in the amount of $25,799.  Applicant admits \neach of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated March \n13, 2018, and August 27, 2018, confirm the tax lien.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)  \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a series of unfortunate events that he \nstates will not recur.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)            \n \n \n \nApplicant started working for his current employer in September 2008.  He \nstarted as a pilot and over time was promoted to Lead Pilot, Chief Pilot, and is now \nSenior Pilot, serving as an instructor Pilot.  Applicant has held a security clearance \nsince 2007 that he obtained while working for another defense contractor.  He has \nnever had a security violation.  The only disciplinary matter that he has encountered \nwas in October 2018 when he was written up by his supervisor for falling asleep in the \nairport after being on duty for 24 hours.  (Tr. p. 23.)     \n \n \n \nIn 1999, Applicant was in business with his mother, who owned a large real \nestate company.  The business was sued for $10,000 regarding a contract. To protect \nhis mother and her assets, upon the advice of counsel, in approximately November \n1999 Applicant filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy.  (Government Exhibit 6.)  A month later, \nin December 1999 the Chapter 13 was dismissed.  Applicant was not delinquent with \nhis bills, and about $3,000 in debt at the time.  (Tr. p. 25.)  In fact, he owed three \nproperties that were all in good standing.  The business eventually prevailed in the \nlawsuit.      \n \n \n \nApplicant and his wife were married in 2010.  His wife was to handle paying the \nhousehold bills, while Applicant worked overseas, as he was deployed a lot.  Applicant \nput her on a personal spending budget of $2,000 a month to cover her expenditures, \nwhich included getting her hair and nails done.  (Tr. p 43.)  Applicant\u2019s paycheck was \ndirectly deposited.  It became customary for his wife to excessively spend.  She not only \n\n \n3 \n \nspent her monthly allowance, but also the money she should have been using to pay \nthe bills.  She went shopping and started living a lavish lifestyle they could not afford.  In \n2015, Applicant came home from assignment and was surprised to learn that they had a \n$12,000 facial laser machine and a commercial two-station expresso machine.  (Tr. p. \n45.)  In 2017, Applicant learned for the first time that his wife had also failed to file their \nstate income taxes for tax years 2013 and 2014.  (Tr. p. 17.)  As a result, Applicant \nbecame indebted to a state for a tax lien entered against him in 2017 in the approximate \namount of $25,799.  Applicant stated that the actually tax liability was about $2,000 but \nbecause the tax returns were not filed, the Applicant was taxed and charged the \npenalties by the state using their calculations, and his indebtedness increased to \n$25,799.  He has now paid the tax lien in full through wage garnishment.  The \ngarnishment started in February 2017 and was completed in December 2017.  (Tr. pp. \n40-41 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits BF)      \n \n \n \nIn January 2016, Applicant\u2019s mother was in a car accident that resulted in a \nfatality.  She hit two elderly women in her elder community, one died and the other one \nhad a broken ankle.  Both a criminal lawsuit and a civil lawsuit were filed against \nApplicant\u2019s mother.  Legal fees for his mother were expensive and Applicant states that \nhe spent over $250,000 in attorney\u2019s fees.  Applicant\u2019s mother lost both the civil and \ncriminal cases.  In the criminal case, she pled guilty, and is currently serving time in \nprison.  She was also ordered to pay restitution.  In the civil case, a judgment was \nentered against her for $950,000 in damages.  The insurance company paid $200,000 \nand there is still a balance owed of $550,000.  The civil suit also names the Applicant, \nas he is the sole trustee of his mother\u2019s trust.  Applicant states that under the \ncircumstances he was forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  (Government Exhibit 5.)      \n \n \n \nApplicant and his wife separated in February 2016, and divorced in December \n2017.  With his mother\u2019s on-going legal situation and his wife\u2019s excessive spending, he \ndid not want the responsibility to have to pay for his wife\u2019s delinquent debts.  He stated \nthat even after they separated, he was in contact with her every day.  He paid for her \nroof on her house and he bought her a car.  (Tr. p. 55.)  Applicant stated that he had \ntried to talk with his wife about her spending, as he still loved her.  They even started \ncredit counseling; but she was out of control, and it got to the point where he could no \nlonger be responsible for her spending.  Following their divorce, his ex-wife committed \nsuicide on September 11, 2017.          \n \n \n \n \n \nIn approximately March 2018, Applicant filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy with \nunsecured claims totaling approximately $13,000.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Applicant \nexplained that most if not all of this debt listed in the bankruptcy was incurred by his ex-\nwife during their marriage.  Applicant indicates that the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee is \ncurrently waiting until one of the properties, a house in the trust, is sold before \ndistribution to the plaintiffs of the monies will occur.  (Tr. p. 67.)  Applicant also admitted \nthat he had at one time transferred his mother\u2019s property into his name in order to \nprotect her assets from the civil judgment.  He was then told he committed fraud by \ntransferring property to avoid paying the judgment.  Applicant realizes that this was \nwrong and that the judgment must be paid.     \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant currently earns between $160,000 and $190,000 annually.  He states \nthat he is frugal and responsible with his money.  He is still supporting his ex-wife\u2019s \nsons.  One is currently in college and the other will go next year.  His current net worth \nis approximately 2 million dollars.  He testified that he has the money to satisfy the \njudgment entered against his mother, and any other expenses that may come his way.          \n \n \n \n \nTwo letters of recommendation from coworkers and friends of the Applicant \nindicate that he is considered to be trustworthy, dependable, loyal, and professional at \nall times.  He is highly recommended for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits G and \nH.) \n \n \n \nTwo letters of recommendation, one from a chief pilot, who has worked with the \nApplicant for about ten years, and another from a retired federal civil servant and long-\ntime friend of the Applicant, attests to his \u201cunbroken record of proper handling of \nclassified information\u201d.  Applicant is described as highly professional and loyal to the \nUnited States.  He has consistently demonstrated integrity and high moral character, \nand is considered a staunch American patriot worthy of an appointment to a classified \nposition.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits I and J.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n5 \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \n  \nApplicant\u2019s first bankruptcy filing in 1999 was essentially strategic to protect his \nmother\u2019s business assets.  It was dismissed a month or so later and nothing ever \ntranspired.  In 2017-2018, Applicant became delinquently indebted during his marriage \ndue to the fact that his wife was not paying the bills as agreed, and did not file his state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2013 and 2014.  To resolve his delinquent debt, \nApplicant paid the lien that was against him for back taxes in the amount of $25,799.  \nHe also filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy relief for the outstanding debt his wife incurred \nduring their marriage without his knowledge and consent.  Under the circumstances, the \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a)  the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b)  the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nApplicant has shown a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent marital debt.  He \nhas filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to reorganize the debts and get them paid.  There is \nnothing else in the record that leads one to believe that Applicant is not forthcoming or \nthat he has been unreasonable and irresponsible.  Applicant clearly understands that he \nmust live within his means at all times, and pay his bills in a timely manner.  His has \npaid off his state taxes and is clearing up his other debts related to his mother\u2019s legal \nsituation.  Under the circumstances, he has acted reasonably and responsibly with \nrespect to his debts.  Assuming that he follows the trustees plan under the Chapter 11 \nand is not found liable for his mother\u2019s legal situation, or is found liable, and pays the \ndebt, it is found that his debts are now under control, as he has the monies or can get \nthe monies to pay the debt.  Furthermore, Applicant has not incurred any new debt \nsince the end of his marriage.  He has demonstrated that future financial problems are \nunlikely.  There are clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis.  Applicant is well respected by his \nprofessional colleagues, friends, supervisor, and management. He has shown good \njudgment and reliability and demonstrated that he is financially responsible.          \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a: through 1.c.  \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

He failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish \nmitigation with respect to his delinquent debt. National security eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 13, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented effective June 8, 2017.  \n01/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 8, 2018, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

He provided nothing further in that \nregard. These debts are unresolved. (Answer; Item 6.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n& 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated over $33,000 in delinquent debt, which became delinquent \nbetween 2016 and 2017. He claims he has insufficient income to address these liabilities. \nThere is sufficient evidence to establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant has insufficient income to meet all of his financial obligations. One \nstudent loan is being repaid through garnishment, but the other six student loans and the \ncredit card account remain delinquent. There is no evidence that he will be able to avoid \ndelinquent accounts in the future. His debt is ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to two weeks of unemployment and a \nsubsequent reduction in pay. Those are circumstances beyond his control. However, he \nhas been fully employed since May 2016, and continues to be unable to meaningfully \naddress his delinquent accounts. The record lacks documentation to show he reasonably \nand responsibly addressed his delinquencies. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully \nestablished.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation of financial counseling. There is minimal \nevidence to conclude that his financial problems are under control. He has not established \nvoluntary payment agreements for his student loans or for his credit card. While he \nindicated he was seeking help from a debt management program, he provided nothing \nfurther in that regard. He is repaying the largest student loan through garnishment, but \nthat action is involuntary and does not demonstrate good faith. The evidence does not \nestablish full mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not claim to dispute any of his alleged delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(e) \ndoes not apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with his \nmilitary service. However, he failed to meet his burden to show he is reasonably and \nresponsibly addressing his debts. Future financial problems are likely. He may be eligible \nfor national security eligibility in the future if he is able to document responsible actions to \nmaintain solvency, but the record at this time is absent of such evidence. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

However, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances and has \nmitigated the potential financial security concern. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on January 9, 2018. \nOn June 25, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \nDOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative \njudge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on October 4, 2018, and the case was \nassigned to me on January 30, 2019. On April 3, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings \n\n2 \n \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for April 23, 2019. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified but did not submit any \ndocumentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 6, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 56-year-old special investigator employed by a federal contractor \nsince May 2018. She earned her practical nurse license in 1985 and her bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2017. She and her husband married in 1986 and have two adult children. \nApplicant\u2019s husband retired from the Army in 2000. (Tr. 27-28.) This is Applicant\u2019s first \napplication for a security clearance. (GX 1.)  \n \nThe SOR alleges two debts: a charged-off vehicle-loan account for $38,717 and a \ncharged-off personal loan for $8,506. Applicant admits both of the allegations. The \ndelinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s April 2019 and January 2018 credit bureau \nreports (CBR) (GX 4; GX 2), and discussed in her personal subject interview (PSI) \nsummary (GX 5) and responses to interrogatories (GX 3). Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \n \nThe $38,717 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a loan for a recreational vehicle that \nApplicant co-signed with her husband in August 2005 for about $71,800. They made \npayments of approximately $591 per month until December 2015. Earlier in 2015, they \nexperienced a tire blowout and subsequent accident. The insurance company assessed \nthe vehicle as a total loss. The loan holder, which had purchased the vehicle loan in 2013 \nor 2014, demanded full repayment of the loan balance. Applicant\u2019s husband attempted to \nnegotiate a settlement with the loan holder, but was unable to do so. He eventually \nstopped making payments and the vehicle was voluntarily repossessed. According to the \nloan holder, the vehicle was sold for $17,000. However, the loan holder continued to \ndemand the entire balance from Applicant and her husband. Applicant\u2019s husband \ncontinued to attempt to negotiate a settlement with the loan holder. He made a payment \nof $125 in April 2018 with the intention of showing a good-faith effort to reach an \nagreement. (Tr. 22-24; GX 3.) The loan holder offered a settlement of $15,000 to be paid \nat $625 a month for 24 months. Applicant\u2019s husband made a counter offer of a $4,000 \nlump-sum settlement, which the loan holder rejected. Applicant and her husband have \nnot had any contact with the loan holder since April 2018. Applicant has not taken any \nindependent action to resolve this debt because her husband has taken responsibility for \nresolving this account. (GX 5; Tr. 30.) \n \nIn 2013, Applicant took out a personal loan to help her daughter pay for college. \nSeveral months later, Applicant\u2019s hours at her job were cut from full-time to part-time and \nshe was unable to afford the loan payments. After approximately six or seven months, \nApplicant entered a repayment plan with the creditor to pay $75 a month, which was \nautomatically drafted from Applicant\u2019s checking account. Applicant made her final \npayment in June 2018. (GX 3; Tr. 18-19.) \n\n3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s CBRs show a credit history that dates back to 1994, that includes paid \noff lines of credit, vehicle loans, and credit cards. She is current with repayment of her \nstudent loans. Applicant refinanced her mortgage loan in 2017, and she has timely made \nall payments with the current and previous mortgage-loan holders since purchasing the \nhouse in 2000. (GX 4; GX 2.) Applicant invests in a 401(k), and she and her husband \nhave several certificates of deposit and other investments. She lives within her means \nand is fiscally stable and responsible. (Tr. 50-51.) Applicant was straightforward, sincere, \nand credible in her testimony.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n4 \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993).  \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information\u2026. \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline:  AG \u00b6 19(a): an inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n\n5 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe conditions that caused Applicant to become delinquent on her two debts arose \nunder unique circumstances which were largely beyond her control. Applicant fell behind \non a personal loan when her hours were cut from full-time to part-time. She acted \nresponsibly by entering a repayment agreement with the creditor that she satisfied in June \n2018. The delinquent account for the vehicle loan occurred following an accident. \nApplicant\u2019s husband has continuously made a good-faith effort to resolve this account \nwith the creditor. With the exception of these two delinquent accounts, Applicant has a \nlong-standing sound financial record, which includes consistent repayment of her \nmortgage loan, credit cards, vehicle loans, and student loans. She lives within her means \nand actively manages her finances. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts did not arise from lack \nof self-control, irresponsibility, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) apply. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances.  I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant invested in her future by gaining her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. She has \na lengthy history of excellent financial management and is currently financially stable and \nfiscally responsible. Applicant was straightforward, sincere, and credible in her testimony.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the potential security concerns raised by her financial issues. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n6 \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nFormal Findings \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 54 years old and is married with three grown children. He has a high school diploma and some college. He is employed with a defense contractor as a Security Associate. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR identified that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and that he has four delinquent debts totaling approximately $13,000.

Henderson, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \nFebruary 5, 2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge: \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nOn April 16, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SF-86).  \n(Government Exhibit 1.) On September 6, 2018, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons \n(SOR), \ndetailing \nsecurity \nconcerns \nunder \nGuideline \nF, \nFinancial \nConsiderations.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines, effective within the \nDoD after June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 26, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on October 29, \n2018, and the case was assigned to the undersigned Administrative Judge that same \nday.  The notice of hearing was issued on November 15, 2018, scheduling the hearing \nfor December 6, 2018.  The hearing was convened as scheduled.  At the hearing the \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment presented four exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 4, \nwhich were admitted without objection.  Applicant presented no exhibits at the hearing.  \nThe record remained open until close of business on December 20, 2018, to allow \nApplicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  Applicant\u2019s submitted \nthree Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits A through \nC, which were admitted without objection.  He also testified on his own behalf.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 17, 2018.  Based upon a \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.   \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and is married with three grown children.  He has a high \nschool diploma and some college.   He is employed with a defense contractor as a \nSecurity Associate.  He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  \n \nThe SOR identified that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and that he has four delinquent \ndebts totaling approximately $13,000. Applicant admits his failure to file his Federal \nincome tax returns in a timely fashion, as well as the back taxes, but denies the other \ndebts set forth under this guideline.  Credit reports of Applicant dated June 25, 2016; \nand October 15, 2018, reflect that each of the debts remain outstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits 3 and 4.)  Applicant has been working for his current employer since 2015.  \n \n \nApplicant states that for many years his wife was the breadwinner in the family, \nwhile he stayed home with the children.  He also trusted his wife to handle the \nhousehold finances as well as their taxes.  During this period, they struggled financially \nand did not earn enough money to support the family.  At some point, Applicant learned \nthat their income tax returns were not being filed on time.  Applicant states that they \ncontacted the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and set up a payment plan.  During those \nyears, Applicant was not involved in the family finances. \n \n1.a., and 1.b.  Applicant testified that things have changed with how the household \nfinances are handled.  Applicant is now much more involved in the family finances.  \nApplicant has worked hard to make sure that all of his Federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2011 through 2016 have been filed.  (Tr. p. 23.)  He has provided copies of each \nof the Federal income tax returns in question.  At the time of the issuance of the SOR, \nhe owed approximately $11,685 in unpaid back taxes.  Since September 2018, \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant has been on a payment plan with the IRS and pays $160 monthly toward his \nback taxes that is automatically deducted from his paycheck.  On December 18, 2018, \nApplicant updated his installment agreement to include tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017. \nHe now owes approximately $16,393 in back taxes.  Effective January 17, 2019, \nApplicant\u2019s new monthly payment to the IRS is $200.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit \nC.)      \n \n1.d. \nA judgment was filed against the Applicant in August 2010 in the approximate \namount of $1,100.  Applicant has no knowledge of the debt.  He believes this is an \nidentity theft issue or mix up as the judgment is not his.  He contacted each of the three \ncredit reporting agencies and disputed this debt.  The debt was removed from two of his \ncredit reports and is in the process of being removed from the third.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-\nHearing Exhibit B.) \n \n1.e.  A delinquent medical debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$243.  Applicant had no knowledge of the debt.  After attempting several times to \ncontact the creditor, who never answered the telephone, Applicant contacted each of \nthe three credit reporting agencies and disputed this debt.  The debt was removed from \ntwo of his credit reports and is in the process of being removed from the third.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.) \n \n1.f.  A delinquent medical debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$45.  Applicant has no knowledge of the debt.  After contacting the creditor who could \nnot provide him with any information, he contacted each of the three credit reporting \nagencies and disputed this debt.  The debt was removed from two of his credit reports \nand is in the process of being removed from the third.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit \nB.) \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from the Director of Security Administration who is \nalso the Facility Security Officer, a Security Supervisor, and a representative from the \nhuman resources department reflect that Applicant is considered to be a valuable \nemployee.  He is described as a reliable, hard worker, who is honest and forthcoming.  \nHe has a solid work history, a strong sense of duty, a great deal of integrity, and \nconstantly strives to make sure that he is doing the right thing.  He also follows all \nsecurity rules and regulations with regard to the proper handling of sensitive materials.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Post Hearing Exhibit A.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n\n \n5 \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19.  Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired; \n \n \nFor many years, Applicant was not involved in the family finances and taxes and \nallowed his wife to handle those matters, as they filed jointly.  At some point, during \nthose years, he learned that he failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax years \n2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 on time.  He also learned that he became \nindebted for back taxes in the amount of approximately $11,685.  His actions \ndemonstrate both a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do so. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations are \npotentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and    \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n  \n          For many years Applicant thought he could trust his wife to file their tax \nreturns and he was not involved.  From this experience, he has learned that he \nmust be involved in all financial matters including the taxes in order to ensure \n\n \n6 \n \nthat they are timely filed.  He is now involved in his household finances.  He has \nfiled all of the Federal income tax returns in question, and is making regular \nmonthly payments to the IRS each month to resolve his debt.  He has disputed \nthe other three delinquent debts listed on his credit reports, and they have all \nbeen removed from two of the credit reporting agencies, and the third agency is \nin the process of removing them, as none of the three delinquent debts are \nactually his.  There is a clear pattern of systematic payments to show financial \nresponsibility.  There is sufficient evidence here to show that he has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances and that he demonstrates reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e.: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

This concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly compromise sensitive information in order to raise money.

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nKILMARTIN, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information in a public trust position is \ngranted. \n Statement of the Case \nOn September 21, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. The action was taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the adjudicative guidelines (AG\u2019s) effective within the DOD for \nSORs issued after June 8, 2017.  \nApplicant timely answered the SOR on October 16, 2018, and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 15, \n2018. \n01/24/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing \non November 21, 2018, scheduling the hearing on December 6, 2018. I conducted the \nhearing as scheduled, and Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \u2013 4 were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B were also admitted without objection. I left \nthe record open until January 7, 2019, for Applicant to submit supplemental \ndocumentation. (Tr. 58) He submitted post-hearing documents during this period \nincluding a credit report dated January 7, 2019, and additional documents from a well- \nknown credit-repair agency that Applicant employed. These were collectively marked as \nAE C and admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) \non January 2, 2019. \n \n \n \n                      \n \n  \nApplicant is 32 years old. He graduated from high school in 2004 and obtained a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2010. He was married in November 2012, and he has three young \nchildren. (Tr. 27-28) He reports no military service. He has been working in a position of \ntrust at a federal health-care provider since December 2017, with no problems. (Tr. 25, \n54) Applicant testified that he was laid off from his job as an information technology (IT) \nprofessional at a corporation, and he was unemployed from June 2013 until October \n2014, and again from August to September 2017. (Tr. 50)  \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the seven alleged delinquent debts \nplaced for collections, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.g, and the charged-off debt \nat SOR \u00b6 1.a for delinquent student loans in the approximate amount of $11,971. He \nalso admitted the past-due debt for $8,307 at SOR \u00b6 1.f. The debts alleged in the SOR \ntotal $51,966. However, Applicant testified credibly that the debt at SOR \u00b6 1.e is a \nduplicate of the debt placed for collection at SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 22) The higher amount of \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e ($14,076) reflects the inflated amount that the collection agent for \nthe creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b added on for interest and fees to the deficit owed after \nrepossession of a vehicle in 2015. Applicant disputes this debt. (AE C) Thus, the total \nowed is more accurately $37,890. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he has been working with a well-known credit-repair \nagency for two years paying $80 per month. (Tr. 17) This agency purports to reach out \nto creditors to try to obtain validation of debts and remove erroneous debts from the \ndebtor\u2019s credit reports. Applicant produced documents including a computer generated \nprint-out showing 47 negative items removed and 38 remaining on Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport. (AE A) It is unclear what the basis or relevance would be for these negative \nitems, since they are not alleged in the SOR. It demonstrates good-faith efforts to obtain \ncounseling and resolve his financial problems. Applicant also provided a print-out \nshowing that he purchased identity-theft insurance in the amount of $25,000. (AE B)  \n \n \nApplicant moved in with his parents in 2011 after college because he required \nsurgery for a life-threatening condition. (Tr. 23) After recovering, he got a job as an IT \nspecialist but was laid-off in 2013. Next, he tried various jobs outside of his skill set \nincluding a home improvement store etc. (Tr. 24) He testified credibly that he is trying to \nget a deferral on the student-loan debt in the amount of $11,971 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(Tr. 30) He was unable to make payments due to his medical condition and periods of \nunemployment. Applicant produced post-hearing documentation including a January \n2019 credit report reflecting several student loans owed to a creditor in the approximate \namount of $17,000. (AE C) These loans were opened from 2004 to 2008 and are \npresumed to be the same student loans at SOR 1.a. The credit report shows they are all \nin forbearance until February 2019. Additionally, he testified that he owes approximately \n$22,000 to Navient for student loans that are in good standing, and not alleged in the \nSOR. (Tr. 54) It is unclear what payments Applicant is making monthly on any of his \nstudent loans to Navient.  \n \n \nApplicant testified that the debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c in the amount of $2,181 is \nalso for a student loan issued by a bank. Applicant\u2019s mother was the primary signatory \non the loan and he was a co-signor. They have now paid that creditor in full according to \ndocuments produced post-hearing. (AE C) Applicant has also testified credibly and \nproduced documentation showing that the past-due debt for $1,427 at SOR \u00b6 1.f has \nbeen satisfied with one final payment of $382. (Tr. 35-36) This was a loan in the amount \nof $8,307 for home furnishings.  His post-hearing documentation also reflects that his \nwell-known credit repair agency has recently challenged items on his credit report that \nare alleged in the SOR. Validation of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.b and 1.g was \nrequested on his behalf on January 4, 2019. (AE C)   \n \n \nApplicant testified that he was ready to pay the credit-card debt placed for \ncollection in the amount of $587 at SOR \u00b6 1.d. He was negotiating a payment of $320 to \nsettle it at the time of his hearing. (Tr. 34) It still appears on his January 2019 credit \nreport. SOR \u00b6 1.g arose from Applicant\u2019s inability to make rental payments after he was \nlaid off by the state bar association. It was placed for collection in October 2017, and his \nrecent credit reports reflects \u201caccount information disputed by debtor.\u201d (AE C)   \n \n \nHe earns $5,500 to $5,800 a month after taxes and he does have a budget. (Tr. \n47) He usually has approximately $1,000 left over each month, after paying expenses. \n(Tr. 48-49) He had financial counseling from his credit-repair agency that he relied on to \nhelp him improve his credit and resolve his financial problems. Applicant stated that his \nwife recently obtained employment as a consultant earning $2,200 a month. (Tr. 49). \nThis should help their financial situation. He provided no character references or \nperformance evaluations. He demonstrated that he has either successfully disputed or \nsatisfied (or deferred) six of the seven debts alleged in the SOR.           \n  \n \n \n         \nPolicies \n \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \n(See Code of Federal Regulations Title 32 \u2013 National Defense, part 154.13 and part \n154, Appendix J \u2013 ADP Position Categories and Criteria for Designating Positions)  \n\u201cThe standard that must be met for . . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat . . . assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in DOD Directive 5220.6 before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made.  \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nis set out in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the government\u2019s exhibits support the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \nApplicant admitted the seven delinquent debts alleged in the SOR totaling \napproximately $37,890. The government exhibits admitted at the hearing together with \nApplicant\u2019s admissions substantiate these debts. There is sufficient evidence to support \nthe application of the above disqualifying conditions.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate trustworthiness concerns arising from financial \ndifficulties are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of past-\ndue debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant provided testimony and documentation to show that he satisfied SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.f, totaling $3,608. He disputed SOR \u00b6 1.b and SOR \u00b6 1.e is a duplicate of \n1.b (deficit balance on repossessed vehicle). He stated that he intended to pay his \nalleged debt at SOR \u00b6 1.d imminently and he was negotiating a price with the creditor at \nthe time of the hearing. Intentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. \n11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct 23, 2013). He also successfully disputed SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nApplicant obtained deferral of his student loan debts. Additionally, he is already making \npayments to Navient, the creditor on other student loans. He employed a credit-repair \nagency, which reached out to creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g to obtain validation of \nthese debts. Applicant was paying $80 per month for over two years to the credit-repair \nagency in good faith and reliance on its supposed expertise in helping to improve his \nfinancial situation.  \n \n \n \n The delinquencies alleged in the SOR are longstanding. Applicant\u2019s medical \ncondition and periods of unemployment were conditions beyond his control. He has \ndemonstrated that he acted responsibly under the circumstances in obtaining \nassistance and resolving six of his seven alleged SOR delinquencies. He satisfied some \nalleged debts, successfully disputed others, and received a deferral on some of his \nstudent loans. He is engaged in a payment plan and demonstrated good-faith efforts to \nrepay other student-loan creditors. This evidence is sufficient to show that his financial \nproblems have been resolved and are under control. The mitigating conditions \nenumerated above apply.  \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines. Applicant is the father of three young children. He \nhas endured serious medical setbacks, and periods of unemployment, and struggled \nthrough a downturn in the economy.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances no longer remain a trustworthiness concern. He has met his \nburden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations trustworthiness concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1. b - 1.g:                          For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with the interests0 of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for \na  public trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is granted. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n                                                      Robert J.

Petcher, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant was evaluated by a duly-qualified clinical psychologist in February 2018 \nand found to have a poor prognosis for her mental-health stability because of her chronic \nborderline personality disorder and minimization of her need for ongoing psychotherapy \ntreatment. She exhibited adequate judgment and insight during a brief assessment for \nmedication management with her treating psychiatrist in January 2019, but it was not \nestablished that her condition no longer presents a security risk. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline I, psychological conditions. The SOR explained why the DOD \nCAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \nsecurity clearance eligibility for her. The DOD CAF took the action under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n03/27/2019\n\n2 \n \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 16, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On August 30, 2018, under \u00b6 E3.1.7 of the Directive the \nGovernment requested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA). On January 8, 2019, the case was assigned to me to \nconduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. On January 15, 2019, I scheduled a \nhearing for February 14, 2019. \n \nAt the hearing, three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) were admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. Department Counsel offered as GE 4 a report of personal subject \ninterview, which I excluded on Applicant\u2019s objection because it lacked the authentication \nrequired under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive. A list of the GEs (HE I) and an August 30, 2018 \nletter forwarding the proposed GEs to Applicant (HE II) were marked as hearing exhibits \n(HEs) for the record but not admitted in evidence.1  Applicant and one of her co-workers \ntestified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on February 27, 2019. \n \nI held the record open for 30 days after the hearing for documents from Applicant. \nOn February 27, 2019, Applicant timely forwarded documents, which were admitted as \nApplicant exhibits (AEs A-D) without any objections.2 \n \nSummary of SOR Allegations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline I that Applicant received treatment from 1991 to \nat least September 2016 for conditions diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD), bipolar disorder type II, and borderline personality disorder (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that \nApplicant has a history of suicidal ideation and attempts, including in 2011 (SOR \u00b6 1.b(i)), \nin May 2008 after which she was hospitalized on a psychiatric unit (SOR \u00b6 1.b(ii), and in \nAugust 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.b(iii)); and that Applicant was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, \ncluster B personality disorder, and histrionic and/or borderline personality disorder in \nFebruary 2018, and given a poor prognosis (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \n \n \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she admitted the treatment alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a, adding that she continues to receive therapy and medication management \nfor her bipolar disorder. She also acknowledged having suicidal ideation in the past with no \nsuicide attempts since 2010, which she attributed to her alcoholism for which she seeks \nsupport on a daily basis. Applicant admitted that she had been diagnosed with borderline \npersonality disorder in the past but denied that the diagnosis is presently valid. She \nindicated that her bipolar disorder is presently stable, and her recent assessment is that  \n                                                 \n1 In the August 30, 2018 discovery letter, then assigned Department Counsel identified 20 potential GEs. At \nthe hearing, the documents identified as GEs 3 through 19 were entered into evidence collectively as GE 3. \nThe hearing exhibit list was annotated accordingly. \n \n2 AE D consists of six character reference letters, which were admitted as pre-marked D1-D6. \n\n3 \n \nshe has an unspecified mood disorder. She denied that she has a poor prognosis and \nadded that she has worked hard to change her mental health. She indicated that she has \nsupport systems in place that have enabled her to better handle stress. (Answer.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and has an associate\u2019s degree in paralegal studies earned \nin May 1994. (GEs 1, 3; Tr. 65.) She obtained licenses as a certified nurse assistant in \n1995, and as a licensed nurse assistant in 2013. She then attended a technical institute \npart time at night from September 2013 to December 2013. She has been employed by a \ndefense contractor since late March 2015 and seeks a security clearance for her duties. \n(GEs 1, 4; AE C.) \n \n \nApplicant and her first husband married in November 1988, had a daughter in 1989, \nand then divorced in January 1993. They remarried in August 1996 and had two more \ndaughters before divorcing in May 2003. (GEs 1, 3.) As of February 2019, Applicant\u2019s ex-\nhusband was serving a 50-year prison sentence for sexually assaulting their oldest \ndaughter. (GE 3; Tr. 58.) Applicant married her second husband in June 2004, and they \ndivorced in October 2009. In February 2015, Applicant began a cohabitant relationship. \n(GE 1.) She was no longer in that relationship as of February 2019. (Tr. 66.) None of her \nthree daughters currently live with her. (Tr. 67.) \n \n \nApplicant was sexually abused by her stepfather as a child. She has received \nmental-health services from her current provider (clinic X) on and off since age 13, when \nshe overdosed on Tylenol and sleeping pills. She was psychiatrically hospitalized and then \nplaced in foster care. After several hospitalizations for suicidal ideations, she married her \nfirst husband. He was abusive, and she was hospitalized at age 18 and then again at age \n20 in 1991 following an overdose. In August 2002, a psychiatrist at clinic X prescribed \nTopamax for Applicant, and he diagnosed her with bipolar disorder, PTSD, and \u201ca \nsubstantial\u201d Axis II borderline personality disorder. (GE 3.) \n \n \nAround the time of her second divorce from her first husband, Applicant was \nhospitalized for psychiatric reasons. In early September 2003, Applicant intentionally \noverdosed on her daughter\u2019s Vicodin prescription. In April 2004, she returned to treatment \nat clinic X because of the stress of her ex-husband\u2019s upcoming trial on charges of sexual \nassault and its impact on their oldest daughter. Applicant reported symptoms of depression \nand anxiety. She was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and she began cognitive behavioral \nand interpersonal therapy sessions. (GE 3.) \n \n \nIn May 2005, Applicant was hospitalized for six days for depression and suicidal \nideation. At discharge, she was placed on Topamax and amitriptyline and referred to clinic \nX. On May 16, 2005, Applicant was admitted to clinic X\u2019s crisis stabilization program. She \nreported rapid cycling between depression or isolation and manic episodes as well as \n\n4 \n \nauditory hallucinations. At a session on June 22, 2005, Applicant reported auditory \nhallucinations and racing thoughts, which she attributed to the stress of her ex-husband\u2019s \nlengthy prison sentence for molesting their daughter. She was diagnosed on Axis I with \nbipolar disorder and PTSD, and on Axis II with borderline personality disorder, and advised \nto continue with individual therapy. (GE 3.) \n \n \nIn June 2005, Applicant was on suspension for missed time when she left her job of \nfive years. She then held temporary assignments until April 2006 when she landed an \nadministrative position with a realty company. In September 2006 she went on extended \ndisability after she hurt her wrist. (GEs 1-2.) It is unclear what treatment, if any, she \nreceived for her mental health from June 2005 to March 2007. \n \n \nAs of late March 2007, Applicant was living with her two younger daughters and \nseparated from her second husband. Her eldest daughter was living with her parents in \nanother state. Applicant sought support at clinic X, reporting worsening symptoms and \nincreased stress over the previous few months. She described manic behavior, impulsive \nand risky behavior, rapid speech, and mood swings consistent with bipolar I disorder, and a \nsignificant pattern of relationship difficulties, frequent and chronic suicidal ideation and \nintent, and lack of personal identity consistent with borderline personality disorder. She \nalso reported panic attacks in public places. She indicated that her symptoms were \nimpacting her personal relationships and her ability to work, and she expressed a \nreadiness to engage in treatment. Applicant was diagnosed on Axis I with bipolar I \ndisorder, most recent episode depression, severe; eating disorder; and panic disorder with \nagoraphobia. On Axis II, she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. \nTreatment recommendations included psychiatric evaluation, medication monitoring, and \nindividual and group therapy. (GE 3.) \n \n \nOn April 20, 2007, Applicant began seeing her current psychiatrist at clinic X. A \nfriend was managing her Topamax and amitriptyline medications for her so that she did not \noverdose. Applicant indicated that she had significant depression, but she was reluctant to \ntry mood stabilizers because of their side effects. Her psychiatrist assessed her judgment \nand insight as adequate, although her affect was restricted. He diagnosed her on Axis I \nwith bipolar disorder, not otherwise specified, and PTSD, delayed onset, chronic type, and \non Axis II with borderline personality disorder. She agreed to a trial of Lamictal medication \nfor her bipolar disorder, and was advised to return to the clinic in four to five weeks. (GE 3.) \n \n \nFrom August 2007 until July 2008, Applicant lived in another state. She was \nhospitalized for two weeks in May 2008 following an intentional overdose on Elavil. \nApplicant moved back to her current locale in July 2008, and on September 5, 2008, she \nreturned to clinic X for treatment of diagnosed bipolar disorder, PTSD, and borderline \npersonality disorder. She reported current symptoms of depression and anxiety with panic \nattacks, sometimes with no identifiable precipitant. She denied any current suicidal ideation \nor intention, although she acknowledged thinking about self-harmful behavior in response \nto stressors and to changes in her environment. Applicant indicated that she was feeling \nvery stressed due to the pressure to find a job after being unemployed for 2.5 years. She \nacknowledged that alcohol and other drugs (marijuana) were having severe effects on her \n\n5 \n \nlife. Therapeutic behavioral services and weekly individual psychotherapy were \nrecommended to improve her overall functioning. During a session with her psychiatrist in \nOctober 2008, Applicant reported her mood as stable, and she denied a history of \nsubstance use requiring treatment. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant continued in treatment with clinic X. Over the next year, she exhibited \ntangential speech and needed redirection in therapy. As of September 2009, she reported \nincreased symptoms of mania and difficulty managing activities of daily living. She was \ngiven diagnoses on Axis I of bipolar disorder, currently hypomanic, and on Axis II \nborderline personality disorder. Applicant was well-engaged with her service providers and \nshowed good insight into her current symptoms of hypomania. (GE 3.) \n \n \nIn June 2010, Applicant was hospitalized for suicidal ideation with plan and intent.  \nShe self-reported her fear that she might harm her daughters, and as a consequence, the \nDepartment of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) placed her daughters in foster care. \nThat summer, Applicant began attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) for a social \nenvironment free of alcohol. In August 2010, social workers at clinic X noted that Applicant \ncontinued to attend her therapy appointments, but she had difficulty following through with \ntreatment recommendations. During a medication-management session with her \npsychiatrist on November 4, 2010, Applicant reported sobriety of 2.5 months with AA \nattendance. She acknowledged that she had been withholding information from him about \nher substance use over the years. She stated that she relapsed after nine years of sobriety \ninto drinking from two to six drinks per day until 2.5 months ago. She reported increased \nanxiety related to a plan for her children to be placed back with her in December 2010. \nApplicant agreed to a short-term use of Vistaril in lieu of Lamictal. She was given \ndiagnoses on Axis I of bipolar disorder type II, PTSD, and alcohol abuse in early full \nremission, and on Axis II of borderline personality disorder. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant resumed working in April 2011, although her schedule as a factory worker \nmade it difficult for her to attend her therapy appointments. By May 2011, Applicant was \nusing Ativan prescribed by her primary care physician as a sleep aid. During a session with \nher psychiatrist in early May 2011, she reluctantly agreed that she was hypomanic, but she \ndeclined to take prescribed risperidone. Her insight and judgment were assessed as \nadequate. She was advised that should her manic symptoms worsen, she should consider \nthe use of mood-stabilizing medications. (GE 3.) \n \n \nAs of August 2011, Applicant was experiencing emotional dysregulation and anger, \nincluding at DCYF, although one of her children had returned home from foster care. \nThrough AA\u2019s support, Applicant was able to stay sober for the past year. She reported \nsuicidal ideation in the past year, but not in recent months. (GE 3.)  \n \n \nIn April 2012, Applicant hit her head in an automobile accident, which exacerbated \nher mental health issues. Her psychiatrist diagnosed her with post-concussion syndrome. \nBy August 2012, her two teenage daughters were living with her, which was a source of \nstress. Applicant reported an increase in anxiety, moods \u201call over the place,\u201d and a difficulty \nfocusing. She experienced panic attacks and had auditory hallucinations, but she had been \n\n6 \n \nsober for over two years and had no suicidal or homicidal ideations. Borderline personality \ndisorder remained her primary diagnosis with a secondary diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, \nmoderate. (GE 3.) \n \n \nIn July 2012, Applicant left her factory job by mutual agreement following notice of \nunsatisfactory performance. She had been having trouble performing her duties after her \ncar accident. (GE 4.)  Between August 2012 and August 2013, Applicant had a number of \nchanges and losses in her life, including loss of her driver\u2019s license, ending her relationship \nwith her then fianc\u00e9, and the death of a friend from AA. Applicant attended therapy and \nmedication-management appointments at clinic X, but she was not consistent in her \nattendance with therapy after her therapist retired. Over the year, Applicant presented for \ntreatment with increased mood dysregulation, lability, anxiety, decreased energy, sleep \ndisturbances due to panic symptoms and intrusive thoughts. She reported one incident of \nsuicidal ideation with plan and intent, but she did not require psychiatric hospitalization. \nApplicant maintained sobriety throughout the year with ongoing, regular participation in AA \nwith a sponsor. (GE 3.) \n \n \nApplicant was rehired by her former employer in October 2013. In February 2015, \nshe was involuntarily terminated after she did not report for two shifts when she was ill. \nAfter she proved that she had reported her absence, she was offered her old job, but she \nchose instead to work for her current employer. (GEs 1, 4.)  \n \n \nOn March 12, 2015, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry concerning \nany counseling for an emotional or mental health condition in the last seven years, \nApplicant indicated that she has had treatment from 1991 to present at clinic X. (GE 1.) \nApplicant began working for her current employer on March 30, 2015. (AE C.) \n \n \nA clinic X staff-activity log covering June 16, 2015, through September 25, 2018, \nshows that Applicant had 45-minute individual therapy sessions at the clinic approximately \nevery two weeks from June 2015 to April 2016 and from August 2016 through mid-\nFebruary 2017. She attended one therapy session in the spring of 2017. From June 2017 \nthrough November 2017, she attended therapy once every three months. There is no \nevidence of any therapy sessions in December 2017 and January 2018. She was absent \nfrom a service scheduled for January 24, 2018. (AE B.) \n \n \nAt the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical \npsychologist on February 12, 2018. The assessment included a clinical interview; review of \ndocumentation showing a history of long-term mental health treatment for bipolar disorder \nand borderline personality disorder since 1991; and testing consisting of the Substance \nAbuse Subtle Screening Inventory (SASSI-3), and the Million Clinical Multiaxial Inventory \n(MCMI-III).3 The psychologist noted Applicant\u2019s ongoing medication management with \nTopamax under the care of her psychiatrist at clinic X and her individual therapy with a \nsocial worker at clinic X, but also that Applicant had discontinued her use of Ativan and had \n                                                 \n3 The MCMI-III is a self-report psychological-assessment tool intended to identify personality traits and any \npresence of psychopathology. (GE 2.) \n\n7 \n \nstated that she no longer needs psychotherapy. Applicant indicated that she only sees her \ntherapist \u201csometimes for support.\u201d Applicant denied any current suicidal or homicidal \nideation. In the opinion of the psychologist, Applicant \u201cdramatically minimized her history of \nsuch [ideation].\u201d Applicant reported that she was attending five to ten AA meetings a week, \nand she insisted that it was AA that was keeping her stable. The psychologist diagnosed \nApplicant on Axis I with alcohol dependence, full remission, most recent relapse in October \n2015, and bipolar disorder, by history. No present symptoms of bipolar disorder were \nevidenced in the assessment. She gave Applicant a diagnosis on Axis II of cluster B \npersonality disorder, histrionic and/or borderline personality disorder.4 The psychologist \nsummarized her assessment, as follows: \n \nClinical psychopathology is present in [Applicant\u2019s] presentation, her \ndramatic minimization and unwillingness to be forthcoming and realistic with \nregard to both her history of symptoms and her vulnerability to experiencing \nnegative emotions certainly is evidence that her judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness is impaired with regard to the protection of national security. \n.  .  .  Ongoing prognosis for [Applicant] is Poor. Her status is very likely to be \nnegatively impacted by the presence of stressful life events and any alcohol \nuse. She is likely to struggle with emotional lability, with bouts of angry \noutbursts and periods of isolation. She insisted that her relationship with AA \nis what keeps her stable and reported that she does not feel she is in need of \nindividual psychotherapy \u201canymore.\u201d Her minimization of need for ongoing \ntreatment and her reliance on AA as her sole source of stability renders her \nhighly vulnerable to episodes of emotional dysregulation. These personality \ncharacteristics undermine [Applicant\u2019s] ability to maintain with certainty the \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness necessary to protect national \nsecurity. \n \nThe psychologist subsequently concluded that Applicant is \u201clikely unable to consistently \nand reliably remain stable and well over the long term.\u201d (GE 2.) \n \n \nApplicant attended therapy once in February 2018, and approximately every two \nweeks from April through mid-July 2018. There is no indication of any therapy sessions in \nAugust 2018. She had a 45-minute session on September 10, 2018, and had reportedly \n\u201cconfirmed\u201d for September 25, 2018. (AE B.) No information was provided about her \nclinical presentation or progress in staff logs. She testified that she now sees her therapist \n                                                 \n4 Under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), borderline personality disorder is \ndefined by a pattern of instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked \nimpulsivity. Histrionic personality disorder is a pattern of excessive emotionality and attention seeking. \nPersonality disorders are grouped into three clusters based on similarities. Cluster B includes the antisocial, \nborderline, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders. Persons with these disorders often appear \ndramatic, emotional, or erratic. Personality disorders are diagnosed when there is an enduring pattern present \nin a variety of contexts that appeared before early adulthood, and they are typical of an individual\u2019s long-term \nfunctioning. Impulsive behavior in at least two areas and recurrent suicidal behavior are characteristics of \nborderline personality disorder. There is considerable variability in the course of borderline personality \ndisorder. The risk of suicide gradually wanes with advancing age, although the tendency towards intense \nemotions, impulsivity, and intensity in relationships is often lifelong. \n\n8 \n \nevery three months and that her most recent session was in December 2018. (Tr. 56.) She \nprovided no documentation to corroborate that she had therapy. \n \n \nApplicant testified that she goes to a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and a therapist, \nand has them available to monitor her,5 but she then stated, \u201cI just take care of myself \nreally well these days.\u201d (Tr. 48.) Applicant indicated that she is able to manage her mental \nhealth by taking her medication, eating right, and not drinking alcohol or using illegal drugs. \nShe explained that it took her some time to change her negative thought process, and that \nAA is a daily reminder for her to work on her \u201cthinking problem\u201d on a daily basis. (Tr.  51-\n53.) Applicant denied any panic attacks in the last year, although she admitted that \u201cthere \nprobably was an instance within the last year\u201d when she felt really overwhelmed. She did \nnot tell her therapist about it. She would not tell her therapist \u201cunless it gets bad.\u201d She \ncopes with panic attacks by \u201cjust breathing, just meditating and relaxing.\u201d (Tr. 62-64.) \n \n \nDocuments submitted after her hearing included a progress note of a 15-minute \nmedication-management session with her psychiatrist at clinic X in mid-January 2019. \nApplicant reported doing well on her Topamax medication. She had some stressors over \nthe recent holidays and some work stressors, but she reported that she was able to \nmanage them. She exhibited no psychotic or suicidal symptoms, no lability or constriction \nof mood, and adequate insight and judgment. Her psychiatrist assessed her with \nunspecified bipolar disorder, in remission; alcohol use disorder, in remission; and \nunspecified personality disorder with cluster B features by history. She was continued on \nTopamax medication and advised to return to the clinic in three months. (AE A.) Applicant \ntestified that she takes her medication regularly. (Tr. 69.) \n \n \nApplicant did not provide the February 2018 report of the psychologist to her \npsychiatrist for his review, even though she had a copy. She apparently mentioned the \nassessment to her psychiatrist because she was \u201cvery upset about it.\u201d She claims that \nsome information in the psychologist\u2019s report to the DOD was inaccurate, although she did \nnot elaborate about any errors. (Tr. 72-74.) \n \n \n \nApplicant has not consumed any alcohol since 2015. She attends between seven \nand ten AA meetings a week and learned in AA some coping skills that she \u201ccan use\u201d in \nevery aspect of her life. (Tr. 48, 50-51.) \n \n \nApplicant has had no disciplinary issues with her current employer. (AE C.) She has \nenjoyed her work over the last four years and considers it an honor to work there. In late \n2015, she transferred to a more stressful position, which she held for almost three years. It \nhelped her learn how to remain calm and cope with difficult situations. She has been in her \ncurrent assignment since November 2018. (Tr. 47-48, 71.) \n  \n                                                 \n5 Available records show that Applicant has had her present therapist since June 2017 (AE B), but she has \nbeen under the care of her psychiatrist since April 2007. (GE 3.) \n\n9 \n \nWork and Character References \n \n \nA co-worker, who serves as a union steward and was previously employed in the \nsame department as Applicant, has always known Applicant to be calm at work. She \nmanaged a situation that could have been very stressful for her. She had counted on a \nunion official to represent her at her hearing. He had the documentation she intended to \npresent at her hearing but then called that morning and indicated he would be unable to \naccompany her.6  Traffic issues led Applicant and her witness to change their plans and \ntake public transportation, which was delayed. Applicant remained \u201cin good spirits.\u201d (Tr. 33-\n40.) The witness is aware that Applicant was \u201ca heavy drinker at one time.\u201d Yet, he would \nlike to see her obtain a security clearance. He considers her to be \u201ca great American.\u201d \nWhen asked whether his opinion would change if he knew that of her mental health \ndiagnoses, he responded that he had never seen any evidence of those issues. (Tr. 41-\n43.) \n \n \nThree co-workers provided character reference letters for Applicant. A co-worker \nwho has known Applicant for almost four years described her \u201ca kind and caring soul who \nis always thinking of others.\u201d In their time together outside of work, Applicant has acted \nvery responsibly. Applicant takes her sobriety seriously and \u201cattends meetings regularly as \nrequired.\u201d At work, Applicant has been very focused and dependable. The co-worker \nbelieves that it would be detrimental to their employer as well as to Applicant\u2019s well-being if \nshe is not allowed to continue her work. (AE D1.) The other co-workers have known her for \nless than two years. In their experience, Applicant is committed to her work, and she is \nwilling to help when needed. Applicant works overtime on a regular basis. They consider \nher to be an asset. (AEs D2-D3.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s AA sponsor, who has been in the AA program for 30 years, has known \nApplicant for three years. She attests that Applicant attends daily meetings and volunteers \nin AA, going above and beyond what is asked of her. The sponsor has not known Applicant \nto relapse in the past three years. In her opinion, Applicant \u201chandles difficult situations with \ngrace and dignity.\u201d She is well respected and trusted by her peers in AA, and she is always \nseeking new ways to improve herself. (AE D4.) \n \n \nTwo friends who have known Applicant through a women\u2019s group provided positive \nreference letters. They have witnessed Applicant become a leader in planning and \norganizing group outings. A friend of eight years described Applicant\u2019s temperament as \n\u201calways balanced even with chaos around her.\u201d (AE D5.) A friend of the past four years, \nwho has also been involved in the planning and organization of their group\u2019s activities, \nadmires Applicant\u2019s \u201cquiet and self-confident demeanor.\u201d Applicant has shown herself to be \na reliable and dependable friend. (AE D6.)  \n \n \n                                                 \n6 Applicant confirmed that this union official was supposed to act as her personal representative.  I advised her \nthat I would not continue with the hearing and that we would reconvene at some future date. Alternatively, she \ncould continue to represent herself and submit documentation after the hearing. Applicant chose the latter. \n\n10 \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n\n11 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \n \n \nThe security concerns about psychological conditions are articulated in AG \u00b6 27: \n \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this \nguideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No negative \ninference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised solely on \nthe basis of mental health counseling. \n \n \nApplicant began receiving mental health treatment at age 13. Progress records of \nher treatment at clinic X show longstanding diagnoses on Axis I of bipolar disorder \n(secondary) and on Axis II of borderline personality disorder with cluster B features \n(primary). She was hospitalized for psychiatric reasons several times over the years for \nsuicide attempts or suicidal ideation, although not since June 2010.7 She had an instance \nof suicidal ideation with plan and intent at one point between August 2012 and August \n2013, but she informed her therapist and services were added to address her \u201cincreased \nneeds.\u201d The evidentiary record contains no information about her condition or treatment \nover the next four to five years. Available staff logs from the clinic show the dates and \ntimes when she had some therapy and medication-management sessions. When assessed \nby a duly-qualified psychologist for the DOD in February 2018, Applicant exhibited no \npresent symptoms of bipolar disorder, but her personality disorder was seen as negatively \nimpacting her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to protecting national \nsecurity. The psychologist opined that Applicant\u2019s mental health is likely to be negatively \nimpacted by stressful life events and that she is likely to struggle with emotional lability with \nbouts of angry outbursts and periods of isolation. The psychologist gave Applicant a poor \nprognosis and found her to be highly vulnerable to future episodes of emotional \ndysregulation. The following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28 apply: \n \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behavior; \n                                                 \n7 The psychologist who evaluated Applicant for the DOD stated in her report, \u201cThere are records of several \nsuicide attempts, the most recent being in 2011.\u201d Available records of Applicant\u2019s annual treatment and \nprogress at clinic X from August 12, 2010, through August 12, 2012, show that she presented with symptoms \nof depressed mood, agitation, dissociation, mood dysregulation, anxiety, and panic attacks, but there is no \nmention of psychiatric hospitalization during those two years. The clinical review for the period September 16, \n2009, to August 18, 2010, indicates that Applicant was hospitalized for suicidal ideation with plan and intention \nin June 2010.  \n\n12 \n \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing one or more of the following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 29: \n \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a low \nprobability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \n \n \nRegarding AG \u00b6 29(a), Applicant is credited with seeking treatment for her mental \nhealth when she was having difficulty controlling her symptoms. She has had a therapeutic \nrelationship with her current psychiatrist since April 2007, and with some exceptions, she \nhas been compliant with her medications. Available records indicate that she has also \nattended therapy sessions, although she has not always been fully forthcoming with her \npsychiatrist or therapist. She hid her alcohol abuse from clinicians in the past. She did not \ntell her current therapist when she felt very overwhelmed in the last year because she did \nnot consider it bad enough to report. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(b) is partially satisfied in that Applicant\u2019s bipolar condition is in remission. \nHer treating psychiatrist and the DOD-approved psychologist who evaluated Applicant \nfound no current indication of her bipolar disorder. While neither clinician rendered an \nopinion on the risk of recurrence of Applicant\u2019s bipolar disorder, it has always been a \nsecondary mental health issue for her. \n \n \nConcerning Applicant\u2019s primary diagnosis, borderline personality disorder is not a \ntemporary psychiatric condition of the type contemplated within AG \u00b6 29(d). Given the \n\n13 \n \nDOD-approved clinical psychologist\u2019s opinion that Applicant\u2019s personality disorder is a \ncondition that impairs her judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to handling \nclassified information, and that she has a poor prognosis with regard to recurrence of her \nsymptoms in times of stress, it is difficult to find mitigation under any of the mitigating \nconditions. \n \n \nTo dispute that negative prognosis, Applicant submitted a January 2019 progress \nnote of a session with her treating psychiatrist for medication management, Applicant told \nher psychiatrist that her current dose of Topamax was effective, and that she was able to \nmanage recent holiday and work stressors. She exhibited no psychotic or suicidal \nsymptoms, no lability or constriction of mood, and adequate insight and judgment. Her \npsychiatrist assessed her with unspecified bipolar disorder, in remission; alcohol use \ndisorder, in remission; and unspecified personality disorder with cluster B features, by \nhistory. She also presented character assessments from co-workers, who have found her \nto be calm and helpful at work, and from friends, who have found her to be organized. \n \n \nBy all accounts, Applicant has been able to function in an acceptable manner in her \npresent job. She has not had any disciplinary infractions in her current employment. She \ncredits her involvement with AA as giving her the skills needed to manage daily stressors. \nWhile I do not doubt that AA has been of great benefit to Applicant, deference is afforded \nthe opinions of mental health providers in light of their education and experience in \nrecognizing and treating psychological conditions. The DOD-approved psychologist has \nongoing concern for Applicant\u2019s mental health because of Applicant\u2019s primary reliance on \nAA in preference to psychotherapy as the means of controlling her conditions. Applicant \ntestified that she has her psychiatrist and therapist available when she needs them, and \nthat she \u201cjust take[s] care of [herself] really well these days.\u201d Applicant did not share the \nreport of the February 2018 evaluation with her psychiatrist, although she testified that she \ntold her psychiatrist about the DOD-approved psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of borderline \npersonality disorder. Her psychiatrist does not appear to be concerned about her \npersonality disorder at present because the diagnosis was \u201cby history.\u201d Even so, I do not \nhave a favorable assessment from a duly-qualified medical professional attesting that \nApplicant\u2019s psychological conditions do not present a security risk. Absent a favorable \nprognosis, and in light of Applicant\u2019s history of serious psychological symptoms with some \ndisplay of minimization of those symptoms, I cannot conclude with confidence that the \npsychological conditions security concerns are fully mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nIn the whole-person evaluation, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nan applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).8 \n                                                 \n8 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n14 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ability to maintain consistent employment with a calm demeanor over the \npast four years shows that she has made considerable strides in managing her mental \nhealth issues. Even so, I cannot ignore the opinion of a DOD-approved clinical psychologist \nthat Applicant has impaired judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to the \nprotection of national security. There is no assessment from a duly-qualified medical \nprofessional that classified information would not be at risk should Applicant be placed in a \nparticularly stressful situation in the future. A co-worker believes it would be detrimental to \nApplicant\u2019s well-being if she cannot continue in her current job, which suggests the \nimportance of Applicant\u2019s job to her, but also that she may still have difficulty coping with \nchange. The Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons noted, I am unable to conclude that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n_____________________ \nElizabeth M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted to the one allegation of the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 5.)

On July 3, 2018, in accordance with DoD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under Guideline G. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDepartment of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 4, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 5, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nNotice of Hearing on September 11, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nOctober 2, 2018. The Government offered Government Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 5, \n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \npresented Applicant Exhibit (AppX) A. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) \non October 12, 2018. Pursuant to repeated requests, the record was left open for five \nmonths for the receipt of additional evidence. On January, 2, 2019; February 4, 2019; \nand March 4, 2019, respectively, AppXs B, C, and D were submitted, and received \nwithout objection. The record closed on March 4, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the one allegation of the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 5.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor since 2004, and has held a security \nclearance since 2013. (TR at page 18 line 16 to page 21 line 5.)  \n \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \n \n1.a. Applicant started drinking alcohol \u201cregularly\u201d in 2006. (TR at page 27 lines \n1~6.) Until 2006, his regular consumption would be about \u201ceight drinks\u201d at one sitting. \n(TR at page 27 line 17 to page 28 line 4.) That consumption \u201cincreased both in \nfrequency and in quantity\u201d in \u201cabout 2008.\u201d (TR at page 28 lines 5~20.) In 2013, \nApplicant was diagnosed as suffering from \u201cfatty liver disease,\u201d but Applicant continued \nto consume alcohol. (TR at page 29 lines 1~24.) His treating physician thought \nApplicant was drinking excessively; and as a result, \u201cadvised . . . [Applicant] to quit \ndrinking.\u201d (Id.) However, Applicant continued to consume alcohol. \n \n \nFrom September of 2013 until January of 2014, Applicant received treatment for \nhis liver disease. (TR at page 33 line 3 to page 34 line 23.) There he \u201clearned a lot \nabout alcohol, alcoholism, or alcohol addiction.\u201d (Id.) As a result, Applicant abstained \nfrom alcohol consumption until May of 2014. (TR at page 34 lines 15~23.) He then \nreturned to its consumption, \u201cmore than approximately six drinks at the time during the \nweek. On the weekend . . . it was variable but would tend towards more 10 drinks at a \ntime.\u201d (TR at page 37 line 18 to page 38 line 3.) In October of 2015, and again in \nFebruary of 2018, Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from an \u201calcohol use disorder, \nmoderate.\u201d (GXs 4 and 5.) However, Applicant continued to consume alcohol until \nAugust of 2018, a month after the issuance of the SOR. (TR at page 18 lines 1~8.) In \nthe last seven months, Applicant has been committed to his alcohol abuse recovery, as \nevidenced by his authored progress reports. (AppXs B~D.)  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n  \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 22 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions may apply: \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \n \nApplicant was diagnosed as suffering from an alcohol use disorder in 2015 and \nagain in 2018, but continued to consume the intoxicant. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 23 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Three conditions may apply: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n                                                                                                                                  \nAlthough it appears that Applicant now acknowledges his alcohol abuse problem; \nwith only seven months of sobriety after more than a decade of abuse, it is too soon to \nsay Applicant\u2019s abusive consumption will not recur in the future. Alcohol Consumption is \nfound against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol \nConsumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on November 2, 2015. On \nJune 29, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in\nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines\n(December 10, 2016), for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017.\nApplicant answered the SOR on July 26, 2018, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase on August 22, 2018. On August 23, 2018, a complete copy of the file of relevant \n02/14/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nmaterial (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He \nreceived the FORM on September 5, 2018, and did not respond. The case was assigned \nto me on January 17, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included Item 9, a summary of a personal subject interview (PSI) \nconducted on September 12, 2017. The PSI summary was not authenticated as required \nby Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant that he was entitled to \ncomment on the accuracy of the PSI summary; make any corrections, additions, deletions \nor updates; or object to consideration of the PSI summary on the ground that it was not \nauthenticated. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summary by failing to \nrespond to the FORM. \u201cAlthough pro se applicants are not expected to act like lawyers, \nthey are expected to take timely and reasonable steps to protect their rights under the \nDirective.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old senior network engineer employed by a federal \ncontractor since October 2014. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in July 2010, and he \npreviously worked for federal contractors from November 2012 to March 2013. He \nmarried in June 2007 and has three children, ages 10, 7, and 6. He received a security \nclearance in November 2010.  \n \n \nThe delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are reflected in a credit report from \nNovember 2015. (Item 8.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: mortgage loan in foreclosure with a balance of $317,952. Applicant \npurchased a home in March 2007 for $328,000 and had an interest-only mortgage loan, \non which the payments were $2,000 per month. When his wife stopped working as a day-\ncare provider, they began having financial difficulties. He tried unsuccessfully to refinance \nhis mortgage loan. His mortgage lender went bankrupt and the loan was assumed by \nanother lender. At the suggestion of a friend, Applicant enrolled in a debt-relief program \nthat advised him to challenge the lender\u2019s authority to collect payments. He filed \ndocuments in October and November 2011, demanding that the successor lender provide \nproof of authority to collect the payments. There is no evidence that the lender responded. \nApplicant stopped making payments and deposited $2,000 in an escrow account each \nmonth.  \n \nIn order to avoid foreclosure, Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in \nJune 2012. The petition included the company servicing the mortgage loan and the credit-\n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (GX 1) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n\n \n3 \n \ncard accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.g, and it indicated that the debts were disputed. \n(Item 5.) The bankruptcy petition was dismissed in August 2012 when Applicant failed to \nattend the creditors\u2019 meeting. He filed another Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in October \n2012. After the bankruptcy court declined to approve Applicant\u2019s payment plan, he \nchanged his mind about pursuing bankruptcy and requested that his petition be dismissed \nwithout prejudice. The petition was dismissed in February 2013. This petition listed the \nmortgage loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and the credit-card accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e \nand 1.g, and it indicated that the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was disputed. (Item 7.) \nThe two bankruptcies are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.i.  \n \nApplicant sought permission from the loan servicer for a short sale, which was \ndenied. (FORM Item 9.) The property was foreclosed, and it was sold in March 2016 to \nanother realtor. Applicant applied for and received relocation assistance from the buyer \nand agreed to move out by April 30, 2016, in return for $3,000. (Item 10, Exhibit B-1.) The \nrecord does not reflect the sale price for the home. A credit report from November 2015 \nreflected that the property was in foreclosure, with a balance due of $317,952. There is \nno evidence in the record reflecting a deficiency after the foreclosure sale. Based on the \nlimited evidence in the record, the debt appears to be resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g: Credit-card accounts charged off for $5,172; $3,322; and \n$8,173; credit-card accounts placed for collection of $14,340; $12,707; and $6,072. \nApplicant fell behind on credit-card payments at the same time as his mortgage loan, and \nhe used the same debt-relief provider to dispute these six debts. His provider used a \ncommon practice of disputing every debt listed in a credit report, in the hope that some \ndebts would fall off the credit reports. Applicant did not challenge the validity of any \nspecific debts or assert specific errors underlying his delinquent debts. Instead, he made \ngeneral assertions asserting faulty accounting and lack of documentation. The accounts \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g were disputed in November 2011. The accounts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were disputed in March 2012. The account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d was \ndisputed in July 2012. The credit report from November 2015 reflects that the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f are disputed. There is no evidence that any of the \ndisputes have been resolved. After filing his disputes, Applicant admitted the debts during \nthe PSI in September 2017 and in his answer to the SOR in July 2018. In his response to \ninterrogatories in May 2018, he asserted that collection of the debts is barred by the \nstatute of limitation. (Item 10.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s first bankruptcy petition did not reflect completion of the required credit \ncounseling, but his second petition reflected that it was completed in October 2012. In the \nPSI, he stated that he is meeting current obligations, but he provided no specific \ninformation about his income and expenses.  \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \n\n \n4 \n \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n\n \n5 \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established for the delinquent mortgage loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nThe downturn in the real-estate market that made refinancing of Applicant\u2019s mortgage \nloan difficult was a circumstance beyond his control. If is not clear whether his wife\u2019s \ndecision to stop working was involuntary and a condition beyond their control. He acted \nresponsibly regarding his mortgage loan by trying to refinance it and exploring the \npossibility of a short sale. This mitigating condition is not established for the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g. Instead of trying to resolve these debts, Applicant resorted to delaying \ntactics until collection was barred by the statute of limitation. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant completed the required counseling for his \nsecond bankruptcy, but his financial problems are not resolved. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant made no voluntary payments on the \nmortgage loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a after it became delinquent. He presented no evidence \nof payments, payment plans, or other resolution of the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g. He abandoned the two Chapter 13 bankruptcies before any payment plans \nwere confirmed by the court. Even if judicial enforcement of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nis precluded by the statute of limitations, reliance on such a remedy is not a substitute for \ngood-faith efforts to pay off the debts. ISCR Case No. 07-16427 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010). \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputed his delinquent debts as a \ndelaying tactic, but he admitted during the September 2017 PSI and his answer to the \nSOR that they were valid debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n\n \n7 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant has worked for federal contractors and held a security \nclearance for many years. He was caught in the downturn in real-estate values and \nhampered by limited income. However, he resorted to delay and avoidance rather than \nreasonable efforts to resolve his delinquent credit-card debts. Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.i: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Troy L. Nussbaum, Esq. \n07/11/2019 \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nLYNCH, Noreen A., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) intent to deny his \neligibility for a security clearance to work in the defense industry. Applicant, a native of \nCameroon, mitigated the foreign influence concerns raised by his relationship with his \nwife and his step-son. Applicant mitigated the foreign influence concerns. Clearance is \ngranted. \n \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 6, 2018, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the foreign influence guideline. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well as DOD \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented on June 8, \n2017. DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the case be \nsubmitted to an administrative judge for a determination whether to deny his security \nclearance.  \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant timely answered the SOR and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge (Answer). The case was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. The \ncase was scheduled for hearing on April 4, 2019. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) \n1 through 3. GE 2 was at first objected to by Applicant\u2019s counsel, but remained in the \nrecord upon review by Applicant\u2019s counsel. GE 1 through 3, were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and presented one witness. He \nsubmitted eleven Exhibits (AE) A through K, without objection. The record was left open \nuntil July 8, 2019, and Applicant submitted documentation. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing on April 15, 2019.   \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout Cameroon. Without objection from Applicant, I approved the request. The \nrelevant facts are highlighted in the Administrative Notice below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 37, was born in Cameroon. He is divorced from an American citizen \nand he has no relationship with her. (Tr. 32) In 2018, he married a citizen and resident \nof Cameroon who has a child in Cameroon. Applicant has a biological child who resides \nin the United States. His mother, sister, and younger brother live in the United States. \nHe received an undergraduate degree in law in Cameroon. He completed a security \nclearance application in July 2017. The SOR (1.a and 1.b) alleges that Applicant\u2019s \nfianc\u00e9e (now wife) is a citizen and resident of Cameroon. Applicant, in his answer, \ndenied the allegation because he is now married. (AE A) SOR allegation 1.b alleges \nthat Applicant gave money to family and friends in Cameroon for a period of time. \n \n  \nApplicant entered the United States in February 2011. He became a naturalized \ncitizen in 2013. He obtained two master\u2019s degrees from American universities. (Tr. 11) \nHe is a security officer for a Federal agency. (GE 1) \n \n \nAs to SOR, 1.a, which alleges that Applicant\u2019s now wife is a citizen and resident \nof Cameroon, she is sponsored by Applicant for citizenship.  He advised her to move to \nthe capital of Cameroon near the American Embassy. This area is far removed from the \nviolence in other parts of Cameroon. He submitted a petition I-I30 for his wife and his \nstep-son (alien relative) with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). (AE B) \nHis stepson is approved for the next phase of the process. (AE H)  Applicant submitted \ndocumentation showing that since May 2018 he has diligently worked with the legal \nprocess to bring his wife and step-son to the United States. (AE C) He paid the fees \nassociated with the process. (Tr. 37, AE I)  His wife had to submit a DNA test to prove \nthat the child is hers. She has done so and that has been approved. Applicant was sent \nthe timeline information for I-I30 applications. (AE D) Applicant received notice from \nUSCIS that the applications are taken in order and that his wife\u2019s is pending. (AE J) \n \n \n As to SOR 1.b, which alleges that Applicant provided financial support to friends \nand family members in Cameroon from 2011 to 2018. He disclosed this information in \n\n \n3 \n \nhis security clearance application. (GE 1) Applicant explained that he realized in about \n2014 that some of the individuals were taking advantage of him so he ceased sending \nmoney except for his mother who now lives in the United States. He had sent money to \nhis current wife and her child, but he no longer sends any money to Cameroon. His \ncurrent wife is now employed. (AE F)  \n \n \nApplicant has no financial interests in Cameroon. His assets are in the United \nStates. He owns a new car and has been approved for a mortgage for a $400,000 \nhome. (Tr.41) He has a 401(k) account. His retirement account is worth about $18,000.  \nHe has a savings account. His current salary is about $140,000 per year. (Tr. 56) \n \n \nAs a post-hearing submission, Applicant submitted documents that confirmed \nthat his wife and step-son\u2019s cases are in line at USCIS to be reviewed. (AE K)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s witness testified by telephone. He has known Applicant through work \nand praised Applicant for his work ethic. The witness stated that Applicant is a decent \nman, and he is aware of the security concerns. He recommends Applicant for a security \nclearance. \n \n \nApplicant submitted letters from family members, including his mother and \nsiblings who live in the United States. They attest that Applicant has no desire to return \nto Cameroon and his dream is here in the United States. Once his wife and step-son \narrive in the United States, he will have no other family in Cameroon. (AE F) \n \n \nApplicant submitted nine character references from colleagues and others who \nhave known him as a friend and a professional. Each attests to his trustworthiness and \nmotivation to perform his duties. He is reliable and disciplined. (AE G) \n \n \nWhen questioned at the hearing, Applicant stated that if he were in a position of \ncompromise, he would immediately alert his chain of command. He would inform the \nproper people and ask for guidance. He would never compromise security. He values \nhis U.S. citizenship. (Tr. 51) \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nThe Republic of Cameroon \n \n \nThe United States established diplomatic relations with Cameroon in 1960, \nfollowing the independence of the French-administered part of the country. Cameroon \nhas had just two presidents since independence. U.S. relations with Cameroon are \npositive, although from time to time they have been affected by concerns over human \nrights abuses and the pace of political and economic liberalization. Cameroon plays a \nkey role in regional stability and remains our strongest regional partner in countering \nterrorism in the Lake Chad region.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe U.S. Department of State advised travelers to Cameroon to exercise \nincreased caution due to crime, terrorism, and civil unrest. The areas most affected are \nthe north, far north, northwest and southwest regions. \n \n \nDuring 2017, Boku Haram continued to take advantage of weaknesses in \nCameroon\u2019s border security to conduct terrorist attacks in the country\u2019s far north region. \nBoku Haram perpetrated multiple and indiscriminate killings against civilians \u2013 Muslim \nand Christian alike \u2013 but also against government officials and military forces. \nCameroonian forces have become more effective at combatting Boku Haram, dozens of \nGovernment attacks on Boku Haram occurred in 2017.   \n \n \nApplicant has been in the United States since 2011 and is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. His immediate family lives in the United States. His wife in Cameroon is being \nsponsored for entry into the United States. Applicant\u2019s step-son has been approved for \nan interview. The legal process is ongoing. His wife has no ties to the government of \nCameroon and has moved to the capital near the American Embassy. Applicant worked \nhard to gain a position of employment that allows him to provide for his family in the \nUnited States.  Applicant knows what to do in a situation of compromise. He does not \nwant to return to Cameroon. He is complying with the legal process to bring his wife and \nstep-son to the United States.  He has no financial interests in Cameroon. \n \n \nApplicant is held in high esteem by his friends and colleagues. He submitted \nnumerous letters of reference. A letter of recommendation touts Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness and reliability while working in a challenging and ever-changing \nenvironment.  (AE G) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n\n \n5 \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n  Foreign Influence \n \n \n\u201c[F]oreign contacts and interest may be a security concern if the individual has \ndivided loyalties or financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign \nperson, group, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 6. Although Cameroon \nhas historically been an ally of the United States, the recent political instability in the \ncountry and region has become a potential threat to U.S. interests operating there. \nAccordingly, Applicant\u2019s relationships with his wife and step-son who are citizens in \nCameroon creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion. AG \u00b6 7(a).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s interactions with his wife cannot be considered casual. However, \ngiven the position and activities of Applicant\u2019s wife and step-son in Cameroon and their \nprocess of coming to the United States, it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the foreign interests and those of the United \nStates. AG \u00b6 8(a). Applicant\u2019s mother, daughter, sister, and brother are living in the \nUnited States. Furthermore, these relationships do not present a conflict of interest \nbecause the ties that Applicant has developed in his current position are so deeply \nintertwined with his own safety and self-interest, it is likely that Applicant will resolve any \npotential conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. (AG \u00b6 (b) \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability to protect and \nhandle classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the \nwhole-person factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). For the past several years, Applicant has been \nworking hard to obtain degrees and work in a position that will provide for his family. He \nhas demonstrated that he takes his responsibilities very seriously, as echoed by the \nmany character letters he received in support of his application for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s work and conduct for the past several years is evidence of his \nability to operate in a sensitive environment with direct national security implications.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1 Foreign Influence: \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1b \n \n \n \nFor Applicant   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n                                               \n \n \n \n________________________ \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the SOR financial allegations, except SOR 1.a and 1.d, which she admitted. She is a 28-year-old prospective computer technician being sponsored by a defense contractor since August 2017 (Tr. 75-77). Her employment record reveals that she has been employed in a series of low-paying jobs since June 2007, including her most recent job. She has never married, and has two children, from separate relationships, who receive no financial support from their fathers. Applicant receives food and housing support from the state. She has not previously held a clearance. The SOR alleges, and GE 1-7 substantiate, nine delinquent debts totaling over $25,000. Applicant admits two debts totaling over $16,000. The debts comprise two vehicle debts, two delinquent education loans, two delinquent medical bills, two delinquent consumer accounts and one delinquent utility bill.

DOHA assigned the case to me 26 \nFebruary 2019 and I convened a hearing 26 March 2019. DOHA received the transcript \n5 April 2019, and the record closed.. \n1Consisting of the transcript (Tr.), Government exhibits (GE) 1-7, hearing exhibits (HE) I-II, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A-E. \n2DoD acted under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent Directive 4, effective on 8 June \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied the SOR financial allegations, except SOR 1.a and 1.d, which \nshe admitted. She is a 28-year-old prospective computer technician being sponsored by \na defense contractor since August 2017 (Tr. 75-77). Her employment record reveals \nthat she has been employed in a series of low-paying jobs since June 2007, including \nher most recent job. She has never married, and has two children, from separate \nrelationships, who receive no financial support from their fathers. Applicant receives \nfood and housing support from the state. She has not previously held a clearance. \nThe SOR alleges, and GE 1-7 substantiate, nine delinquent debts totaling over \n$25,000. Applicant admits two debts totaling over $16,000. The debts comprise two \nvehicle debts, two delinquent education loans, two delinquent medical bills, two \ndelinquent consumer accounts and one delinquent utility bill. Applicant\u2019s 2 August 2017 \nclearance application (GE 1) disclosed $3,754 in education loans falling delinquent in \nApril 2015 and being resolved in February 2017. On 26 November 2018\u2014about a \nmonth after her Answer\u2014Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, listing \nSOR debts 1.a.-1.b and 1.d-1.g (GE 7). She qualified for waiver of the filing fee (AE D). \nOn 6 March 2019, her dischargeable debts were discharged (GE 6). \nApplicant\u2019s education loans (SOR 1.e-1.f) were not discharged. She had been \nmaking small, but regular, monthly payments between June and October 2018 (AE E), \nbut stopped the payments during the pendency of her bankruptcy (Tr. 62). She was \nattempting to get a deferment or forbearance on these loans, but could not because at \nthe time, her accounts were in a bankruptcy status. She had not resubmitted her \nrequest because she felt she could make the required $27 monthly payment due in April \n2019 (Tr. 63; AE E). She has not resumed monthly payments. \nSOR debt 1.c may be a duplicate of SOR 1.g, which was discharged, but the \naccount numbers do not match. AE F shows that on 11 March 2019, Applicant paid a \n$168.17 past-due balance to the SOR 1.I creditor, with a current balance of $340.68 \n3\ndue by 29 March 2019.  Applicant has not documented the status of SOR debt 1.h.\nFor the eleven bi-weekly pay periods between June 2018 and October 2018, \nApplicant averaged about $425 per payday. Two friends of long standing and her \nsister\u2014who cites her holding a clearance for fourteen years\u2014recommend Applicant for \nher clearance. None of them notes any awareness of financial issues, although her \nsister presumably knows. Applicant completed the credit counseling by her bankruptcy \npetition (Tr. 74), but credits her past financial struggles for teaching her the importance \nof keeping her finances straight. She filed for bankruptcy protection so she could start \nwith a clean slate. \n3An account history in AE F suggests Applicant had significant delinquent bills as of November 2018, with \nApplicant making periodic catch-up payments, only to again fall behind with her payments. The $168.17 \npayment was a delinquent bill from an earlier month. No doubt, Applicant keeps payments to this creditor more \nor less current so that her utility service will not be disconnected. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors for evaluating a person\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented. \nEach decision must also reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself, \nconclusive. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole, \nthe relevant adjudicative guideline is Guideline F (Financial Considerations). \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. \nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden \nof persuasion. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgement, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4 \nAnalysis \nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns. Applicant\u2019s current income is \ninadequate for her to do anything other than live paycheck to paycheck, even with food \nand housing assistance. She fell behind on her accounts, and was unable to resolve \n5\nthem without resorting to bankruptcy. While the bankruptcy discharge gives her a new\nstart, she is unable to show any track record of staying current on her accounts post-\nbankruptcy. \nApplicant does not fully meet the mitigating factors for financial considerations. \nHer financial difficulties are both recent and multiple, and may not have not ended; so \nthey cannot be considered unlikely to recur.6 Her financial problems were due to \n4See, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5\u00b619(a) inability to satisfy debts; (b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; (c) a history \nof not meeting financial obligations; \n6\u00b620(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that \nit is  unlikely to recur . . . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances largely beyond her control, and her bankruptcy filing seems clearly \nresponsible under the circumstances.7 A similar analysis supports a conclusion that the \ndebts have been resolved through bankruptcy, 8 and that that resolution was made in \ngood faith.9 \nThe problem for Applicant is that her recently-discharged bankruptcy is too \nrecent for her to demonstrate that she has been able to take advantage of the new start. \nMoreover, her AE F suggests that even with the new start, she will have a problem \nkeeping current on her routine expenses. The conundrum for Applicant is that she \nprobably cannot improve her finances without this better job, which she cannot get \nwithout this clearance. And she cannot get this clearance without a proven track record, \nwhich she cannot get without the passage of time. \nThe Appeal Board has stated that an Applicant need not have paid every debt \nalleged in the SOR, need not pay the SOR debts first, and need not be paying on all \ndebts simultaneously. Applicant need only establish that there is a credible and realistic \nplan to resolve the financial problems, accompanied by significant actions to implement \nthe plan. 10 Applicant\u2019s efforts to date might have constituted such a plan, but for her \ninability to demonstrate that she has benefitted from the new start. Moreover, the \u201cwhole \nperson\u201d evidence submitted by Applicant is insufficient to support a \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nanalysis arguing for granting her clearance notwithstanding her financial issues. I \nconclude Guideline F against Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1. Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs  a-i: \nAgainst Applicant \n7\u00b620(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and \nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n8\u00b620(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications that \nthe problem is being resolved or is under control; \n9\u00b620(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n10ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. 21 May 2008). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n                                             \nConclusion \nUnder the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.

Foreign \ninfluence security concerns are mitigated. Clearance is granted. \nHistory of Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on August 25, 2016. \nOn July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline B. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.    \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 27, 2018, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. I was assigned to the case on October 29, 2018. On December 31, \n2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for January 16, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through V, were \n\n \n \n \n \n2\nadmitted without objection.

Applicant submitted two \ndocuments post-hearing (AE C and D), which are admitted without objection. I received \nthe completed transcript (Tr.) on January 25, 2019. \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning South Sudan. Those facts are set \nforth in the Government\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice for South Sudan. (GE 1) \nThese documents are included in the record. Administrative or official notice is the \nappropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See McLeod v. \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986). Usually \nadministrative notice at security clearance proceedings is accorded to facts that are either \nwell known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section \n25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). The \nfacts administratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not \nsubject to reasonable dispute.

In 1993, when \nhe was approximately 8 years old, he left South Sudan and travelled to a refugee camp \nwith his older brother.

During his employment as a caregiver for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities, Applicant received an award as employee of the month, and in 2010, he was \nawarded employee of the year.

The boys embarked on treacherous \njourneys to refugee camps. (Wikipedia) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nnaturalized U.S. citizen. The day after he took his oath of citizenship, Applicant graduated \nfrom college with a bachelor of science in electrical engineering. (Tr. 33-39; AE K) \n \nIn 2013, Applicant took a trip to Kenya, Uganda and South Sudan. This is the only \ntrip he has taken to visit South Sudan. He used his U.S. passport for travel and disclosed \nall travel information on his SCA. He stayed for approximately two weeks in his city of \nbirth visiting his mother, sister and five brothers. After he returned to the U.S., Applicant \nmoved to another state to start his career as an engineer. He took a position in August \n2016 with his current employer, a Federal contractor.  \n \nApplicant is required to attend security training at his place of employment, even \nthough he does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. Applicant has learned \nthat if an individual expresses any special interest in his work duties, he will immediately \nreport that information to his facility security officer. No one, including his family members \nin South Sudan, have asked any detailed questions about his work with a Federal \ncontractor. If any of his family members were threatened due to his status as a U.S. citizen \nor DOD contractor, Applicant would also immediately report that information to his \nsecurity officer. (Tr. 39-49, 84-85) \n \nApplicant makes approximately $91,000 annually. He is financially stable and pays \nhis student loans, car payment, and monthly bills. He also repaid his airfare expense to \nthe World Church Service. He is current on all of his Federal, state, and local taxes. He \nis not married and does not have any children. (Tr. 49-50, 57-58; AE N, AE M, AE P, AE \nQ) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother is citizen and resident of South Sudan. \nThe SOR also alleges that he has five brothers and a sister, who are also citizens and \nresidents of South Sudan. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.) He admitted these allegations. Applicant \ncalls one of his family members approximately every three weeks. His mother is \napproximately 68, and she currently resides with two of his brothers in a single room hut \nin a village. His mother has no formal education and is a subsistence farmer. Applicant\u2019s \nfamily have no connection to the government or military of South Sudan. (Tr. 84, 88 \n \nThe two brothers who reside with Applicant\u2019s mother provide for her needs as \nfarmers. Since he graduated from college, Applicant has provided financial support for \nhis mother. In 2014 he sent his family $1,985. In 2015, he sent $8,330, which was money \nfor his mother and for a brother who wanted to finish his college education. In 2016 he \nsent $252; in 2017 he sent $255; and in 2018 he sent $775. In addition, whenever \nApplicant is overseas for work, he sends about $200 to $300 every three months to family \nmembers. Applicant reported all pertinent information on his SCA and to the authorized \nDOD investigator during his background interview. He does not have any financial \ninterests in South Sudan. (Tr. 62- 66, 71-77; GE 2, GE 3; AE V) \n \nApplicant expressed his desire to serve the United States because this country \ngave him a new beginning. He believes that working with a company that provides secure \nfacilities for Americans around the world is a good opportunity for him to give back to this \n\n \n \n \n \n4\ncountry. Applicant considers himself to be 100 percent loyal to the United States of \nAmerica. (Tr. 77-78, 91) \n \nAdministrative Notice \u2013 South Sudan3 \n \n \nSouth Sudan became an independent nation in July 2011. Shortly thereafter, \nconflict broke out between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-\nNorth in states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile (together known as the Two Areas), \nwhich resulted in 1.1 million internally displaced persons or severely affected persons \nneeding humanitarian assistance. A separate conflict broke out in the western region of \nDarfur in 2003, displacing nearly 2 million people and causing thousands of deaths. \nFighting in both the Two Areas and Darfur has largely subsided, however the civilian \npopulations are affected by low-level violence including inter-tribal conflict and banditry, \nlargely a result of weak rule of law. The United Nations (UN) and the African Union have \njointly commanded a Darfur peacekeeping operation (UNAMID) since 2007. \nPeacekeeping troops have struggled to address insecurity in Darfur and have increasingly \nbecome targets for attacks by armed groups. Sudan also has faced refugee influxes from \nneighboring countries, primarily Ethiopia, Eritrea, Chad, Central African Republic, and \nSouth Sudan. Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and denial of access by both \nthe government and armed opposition have impeded the provision of humanitarian \nassistance to affected populations. Of note, in June 2018, the United States State \nDepartment reported South Sudan travel advisory at:  \n \nLevel 4 \u2013 Do not travel to South Sudan due to crime and armed conflict. \nViolent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, \nrobberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including \nJuba. Armed conflict is ongoing throughout the country and includes fighting \nbetween various political and ethnic groups, and weapons are readily \navailable to the population.  \n \n \nThe UN, human rights organizations, and media reported the government or its \nagents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. Security forces, opposition forces, armed \nmilitias affiliated with the government and the opposition, and ethnically based groups \nwere also responsible for extrajudicial killings in conflict zones.4 South Sudan is not \nknown for intelligence collection efforts against the United States or U.S. citizens. \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n                                            \n3 The information herein on South Sudan is generally taken from GE 1. \n4 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2017, United States Department of State, Bureau of \nDemocracy, Human Rights and Labor. \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2, describing the adjudicative process. The administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nAnalysis \n \n   \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required \nto raise this disqualifying condition is a relatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes \na risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a close relationship with an individual \nliving under a foreign government. The mere possession of a close relationship with an \nindividual in a foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. \nIf an applicant has such a relationship, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nfor foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation.5  \n \nAs noted, a heightened risk is associated with South Sudan with its persistent \nviolence and human-rights problems. The evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nHere, Applicant\u2019s relationship to his extended family members in South Sudan is \nfar deeper and more than casual, as previously reported. Applicant maintains frequent \nand regular contact with family members in South Sudan. He has repeatedly provided \nfinancial support for his mother and for his brother\u2019s college education. After considering \nand weighing the evidence, I find that Applicant did not rebut the legal presumption of \nclose familial bonds or ties to his family in South Sudan. The relationship with his mother, \nsister, and five brothers leaves him vulnerable to foreign influence, and creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation and coercion and the potential risk for a conflict of \ninterest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) are established. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns under AG \n\u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nAn applicant with relatives, financial interests or other substantial \nconnections to a foreign country faces a high, but not insurmountable hurdle, in \nmitigating security concerns raised by such foreign ties. An applicant is not \nrequired \u201cto sever all ties with a foreign country before he or she can be granted \n                                            \n5 See generally ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n\n \n \n \n \n8\naccess to classified information.\u201d6 However, what factor or combination of factors \nmay mitigate security concerns raised by an applicant with relatives in a foreign \ncountry is not easily identifiable or quantifiable.7 Moreover, an applicant with \nfamilial or other connections to a hostile foreign country faces a heavy burden in \nmitigating security concerns raised by such foreign ties.8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s strong and longstanding ties to the United States, including his \nwork as a Federal contractor, raises favorable inferences regarding his suitability. \nAdditionally, there is no evidence that South Sudan has tried to use his family as \na means to influence him. The government has no burden of showing that South \nSudan officials have attempted to exploit Applicant; however, if such evidence \nexisted, it would cause grave security concerns about foreign influence. His oath \nof allegiance to the United States and Applicant\u2019s security training, honesty in self-\nreporting his foreign connections, and the candor he exhibited at hearing are \nsufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s familial \nconnections to South Sudan. Applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest with respect to South Sudan in favor of the United States.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under this guideline, and evaluating all the evidence in the \n                                            \n6 ISCR Case No. 07-13739 at 4 (App. Bd.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines effective \nJune 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 20, 2018, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on October 15, 2018. The evidence \n02/28/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nincluded in the FORM is identified as Items 2-5 (Item 1 includes pleadings and \ntransmittal information). The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it on October \n29, 2018. Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not file objections or submit any \nadditional evidence. Items 2-5 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to \nme on February 14, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted some of the allegations, with some explanation, and denied \nother allegations. The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since February \n2017. Between 2014 and 2017, he was engaged in non-government employment. From \n2006 to 2014 he was employed by other federal contractors. He has an associate\u2019s \ndegree and a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has never married. He has two children.1  \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed 17 delinquent debts totaling approximately \n$123,000. These debts include past due, charged off, and collection accounts \ncomprised of student loans, consumer debt, state tax liens, and child support \nobligations. Credit reports from May 2017 and March 2018 support the delinquent \ndebts.2 \n \n \nApplicant explained that his debt problems were caused by not having enough \nmoney to pay all his obligations. Except for two of the student loan debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.d), Applicant failed to provide documentation to support that he was addressing \nhis debts through payment, dispute, or contact with the creditors. The status of his debts \nis as follows:3  \n \nStudent Loan Debt. The SOR lists five delinquent student loans. Two accounts are to \ncreditor A totaling $57,764 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d). Three accounts are to creditor B \ntotaling $21,970. Applicant\u2019s SOR answer included an attachment showing his account \nwith creditor A. This account reflected that a loan consolidation occurred in May 2018, \nbut it failed to detail what loans were consolidated. It further documented that Applicant \npaid $58,069 in April 2018 and $143 in May 2018 toward his balance owed. Through \nOctober 2018, it showed Applicant had not made any additional payments and that his \ncurrent balance was $73,943. There was no information in the document concerning the \nstudent loan debt to creditor B. These debts are partially resolved.4   \n                                                          \n1 Item 2. \n \n2 Items 4-5. \n \n3 Items 1, 3. \n \n4 Items 1 (See attachment to Applicant\u2019s answer); 4-5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nTax Liens. The SOR listed two state tax liens (\u00b6\u00b6 1.k and 1.l) in the total amount of \n$3,611. During his background interview with an investigator, Applicant claimed these \nliens were placed because he failed to file his state tax returns for 2013 and 2015, and \npay the resulting tax owed. He stated that his wages were garnished and this tax debt \nwas paid in January 2018. These two liens did not appear on his March 2018 credit \nreport. They are resolved.5 \n \nChild Support. The SOR listed a delinquent child-support debt in the amount of $7,075 \n(\u00b6 1.o). Applicant disputed that he was behind on his child support obligations. He \nmaintained that he consistently has paid his $200 weekly required amount. In his \nanswer, Applicant admitted this debt and stated, \u201cArrears are paid bi-weekly.\u201d His March \n2018 credit report does not list this debt. This debt is being resolved.6  \n \n \nAs stated above, Applicant failed to provide any documentation showing what \naction he has taken to resolve the remaining debts. While his March 2018 credit report \nshows that he disputed some debts, it does not provide the rationale for those disputes \nor their resolution. He did not provide any information about his current financial \nsituation or a budget, other than to state that he can meet all his current obligations. \nThere is no documented evidence of financial counseling.7 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n                                                          \n5 Items 3, 5. \n \n6 Item 1, 3, 5. \n \n7 Item 1, 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant has delinquent student loans and consumer debts that remain unpaid \nor unresolved. He also failed to timely file his 2013 and 2015 state income tax returns \nas required, resulting in the filing of two tax liens. I find all the disqualifying conditions \nare raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. Applicant did not state any circumstances why his financial problems were \nbeyond his control, other than that he did not have enough money. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. Aside from paying two student-loan accounts, apparently being current on his \nchild-support debt, and resolving his tax liens through garnishment, Applicant failed to \n\n \n6 \n \n \nprovide documentation showing efforts to pay or settle any of the remaining debts. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. \nThe involuntary garnishment appears to have satisfied his state tax debt. 20(g) applies.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his civilian employment \nand his payment toward two student loans, but I also considered his lack of progress in \nresolving his remaining debts. Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nstability.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance because of his financial \nstatus. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.d, 1.k \u2013 1.l, 1.o: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b \u2013 1.c, 1.e \u2013 1.j, \n \n \n \n \n \n    1.m \u2013 1.n, 1.p. \u2013 1.q: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Harris, Esq. \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant presented sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns about \nher financial problems and unpaid debts. Her request for continued security clearance \neligibility is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 19, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew her eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor her employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense (DOD) could not \n03/14/2019\n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ndetermine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant \nto have a security clearance.1 \n \n \nOn June 29, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts that \nraise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F). Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing.  \n \n \nI received the case on September 16, 2018, and convened the requested hearing \non, December 12, 2018. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel \nproffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5. Applicant and two witnesses testified. \nApplicant also proffered Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 V. All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 2, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant owed $24,631.38 for three \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.c). SOR 1.a and 1.b allege debts for unpaid \nincome taxes totaling $7,121.38 for the 2013 and 2014 tax years. SOR 1.c alleges a \ndelinquent credit card account for $17,510. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted \neach allegation and provided extensive information about her financial circumstances \nover the past ten years. (Answer) In addition to the facts thus established, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 41 years old. She has completed post-high school vocational training \nand, between 2006 and 2017, extensive DOD-sponsored acquisitions training. Applicant \nhas held a security clearance since 2006 for a series of jobs in the defense industry. (GX \n1) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband, a major in the U.S. Air Force Reserve, have been \nmarried since October 2009. Applicant was married twice previously. Her first marriage \nended in 2007, and she has one 19-year-old child from that marriage. Applicant and her \ncurrent husband have one child, age 8, together. Her husband also has two children -- an \n11-year-old son and another now-adult child who was still a minor when they married --   \nfrom before his marriage to Applicant. Currently, Applicant\u2019s children live with her and her \nhusband, who also shares custody of his 11-year-old. That child lived with them until \nabout 2012. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3) \n \n \nApplicant and her husband each brought debt to their marriage. In addition, they \nused the credit card addressed in SOR 1.c to pay for their wedding. For the most part, \nthey have each managed their personal finances separately and were able to pay down \nexisting debts, including the SOR 1.c credit card, while meeting their regular obligations. \nApplicant avers that events around the time their child was born in August 2010 as the \nbeginning of their recent financial problems. The child was born a month early after a \n                                                 \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \ndifficult pregnancy. As a result, Applicant was unable to work for a few months and was \neligible for short-term disability benefits from her company; however, the paperwork for \nthose benefits was not properly processed, and Applicant was without any income during \nher time away from work. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 19, 51 \u2013 52, 54 \u2013 56, 77 \u2013 78) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband was on active duty in the Air Force when they got married. \nBecause he was dissatisfied with his career path, he took advantage of an early-release \nmonetary incentive and left active duty in 2011. He then affiliated with an Air Force \nReserve command that allowed him to work in his preferred technical field. Since 2011, \nhe has primarily earned his income through a series of temporary active duty orders of \nbetween 90 and 180 days. Unfortunately, there were also times between orders when he \nearned no income for two to four months on average. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s husband \nobtained work as a defense contractor, but he was laid off in 2013 when the contract \nended. After several months of unemployment, Applicant\u2019s husband found work as a \ncivilian employee at a nearby Air Force base; however, he is again on full-time active duty \norders through 2022. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 23 \u2013 25, 36 \u2013 40) \n \n \nBefore and after her child was born in August 2010, Applicant experienced a series \nof job-related and other unforeseen problems that impacted her income. Before the child \nwas born, Applicant and her husband had been living in State A but he was transferred \nto State B, where they now live. Because Applicant\u2019s pregnancy was complicated, and \nbecause her older child was still in school in State A, she did not immediately accompany \nhim. This resulted in added expenses for two residences on top of the expenses later \nincurred for moving and for special care for Applicant\u2019s child. As already discussed, she \nlost income when her short-term disability benefits. After the couple settled in State B, \nApplicant and her husband unexpectedly had to take over full-time care of his 11-year-\nold child, who was beset by numerous emotional and psychological problems. In addition \nto added expenses, care for that child often meant time away from work and lost income. \nBy 2012, Applicant had fallen behind on several credit card accounts, including the debt \nat SOR 1.c. After Applicant\u2019s husband found work, they had more money but his schedule \noften meant he was not able to help with running their household. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer was not paying her the salary she thought they had agreed to when she was \nhired in 2010. When the contract she supported through that job ended in 2016, \nApplicant\u2019s next employment paid her about 20 percent less. Between being unable to \ncoordinate day-to-day management of the household finances because of her husband\u2019s \nunavailability, and a lack of expected income, several bills and other routine obligations \nwent unattended. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 18 \u2013 21, 51 \u2013 56, 61 \u2013 68, 77 \u2013 80) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems began in 2011. When her husband received his early \nrelease from active duty, no taxes were withheld from the incentive bonus he received. \nThey were unable to pay the resulting $13,000 tax bill, but they established a repayment \nplan in April 2012 through which they satisfied their tax debt in May 2018. For reasons \nrelated to loss of income, Applicant and her husband also were unable to pay their 2013 \nand 2014 taxes on time. As of May 2018, as alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b, they owed a \ntotal of $7,121.38. Those tax bills were satisfied between August and September 2018 \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nas a result of payments made starting in October 2016. The most recent credit report \nproduced by the Government does not reflect any past-due tax obligations. (GX 2 \u2013 5; \nAnswer; AX A; Tr. 22 \u2013 23, 38 \u2013 39, 57, 81 \u2013 83) \n \n \nBetween 2012 and 2016, Applicant and her husband struggled to meet their \nregular financial obligations in addition to a variety of unexpected events (two car wrecks, \nfailed appliances, and unplanned travel in connection with Applicant\u2019s stepchild\u2019s moves \nto and from his mother\u2019s home in State C). Additionally, since 2012, when Applicant\u2019s \nstepchild\u2019s mother regained custody, Applicant\u2019s husband has been paying $600 each \nmonth in child support. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s husband had to pay additional child \nsupport for several years for his older child. Applicant\u2019s efforts to resolve her debts were \nslowed further when she and her husband separated in November 2016, thus incurring \nadditional expenses for two separate residences and for legal fees associated with a \ncontemplated divorce. The couple reconciled in April 2018. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 18 \n\u2013 21, 33 \u2013 35, 53 \u2013 54, 78 \u2013 80, 87 \u2013 88) \n \n \nThe last time Applicant was able to make any payments or attempts to negotiate \na resolution of the debt at SOR 1.c was 2013, when she learned the debt had been \ncharged off as a business loss. Between 2013 and 2018, Applicant chose instead to \nresolve other debts that were within her means to pay. In 2018, Applicant was able to \nnegotiate a repayment agreement with the SOR 1.c creditor and, in July 2018, began \npaying $200 each month according to that agreement. After resolving her tax debts, \nApplicant began paying as much as $400 more each month to accelerate resolution of \nthat debt. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX B; AX C; Tr. 30 \u2013 31, 51, 57 \u2013 61, 80 \u2013 81) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances are currently sound. A townhouse they owned as a rental \nproperty has been sold, thus freeing up extra funds and their income is again sufficient to \npay their debts and meet all of their routine obligations. Applicant and her husband have \nnot incurred any new unpaid debts. They have filed their taxes as required since 2014, \nand they have ensured that sufficient taxes are being withheld from their pay so they will \navoid any unpayable tax bills in the future. The most recent credit report produced in this \ncase does not reflect any adverse financial information. (Answer; GX 5; Tr. 81 \u2013 83) \n \n \nApplicant presented extensive information regarding her job performance and her \noverall character. A witness testified about Applicant\u2019s significant generosity and about \nApplicant\u2019s volunteer activities at her child\u2019s school and at a community food bank. \nApplicant has a superior record of performance and enjoys a solid reputation for \nprofessionalism throughout her career in the defense industry. Among the observations \nof government and industrial coworkers and supervisors is that Applicant has a spotless \nrecord of safeguarding sensitive information and is exceedingly reliable and trustworthy. \n(Answer; AX D \u2013 V; Tr. 28 \u2013 30, 41 \u2013 47) \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,2 \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG).3 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) \nof the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest4 for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information.  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.5 A person who has access \nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the Government based \non trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \napplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will \nprotect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national \n                                                 \n2 See Directive. 6.3. \n \n3 The current adjudicative guidelines were issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, \n2016, to be effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \n \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \ninterest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for access in favor of the Government.6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nThe Government established Applicant accrued the delinquent debts alleged in the \nSOR. When the SOR was issued, those debts had not yet been resolved. That information \nreasonably raised a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \n\u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nMore specifically, available information supported application of the disqualifying \nconditions at AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, \nor local income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired). Applicant and her husband did not pay their income taxes on time for the 2011, \n2013 and 2014 tax years. They also accrued significant credit-card debt through one \ndelinquent account that was unresolved for almost ten years. \n \nBy contrast, Applicant established that her debts arose from events and \ncircumstances beyond her control. This included significant fluctuations in income, a \nmarital separation, and other events that adversely impacted their finances. Applicant \nacted in a responsible manner under the circumstances. Although not addressed through \nthe SOR, over the past five years, Applicant has resolved numerous other debts while \ntrying to pay or otherwise resolve the debts listed in the SOR. In 2016, Applicant \nproactively addressed her tax debts through repayment plans with the IRS. Those debts \nare now paid. Attempts in 2012 and 2013 to negotiate with the SOR 1.c creditor were \nunsuccessful. Nonetheless, she continued resolving other debts and, more recently, was \n                                                 \n6 See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nable to establish a repayment agreement regarding SOR 1.c. Since July 2018, Applicant \nhas made regular monthly payments, and more recently, has increased the amount she \npays under that plan by using the money previously earmarked for her tax debts. \nApplicant has not incurred any new delinquencies, and the record does not show that her \nfinancial problems were caused by poor decision making, irresponsible spending, or \nmisconduct. \n \nAll of the foregoing supports application of the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating \nconditions: \n  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude the record as a whole is sufficient to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised by the Government\u2019s information about Applicant\u2019s finances. \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Particularly noteworthy is the information regarding Applicant\u2019s response to \nadverse financial circumstances. It reflects well on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. \nFurther, the testimony and recommendations about Applicant\u2019s character is significant. \nApplicant has a reputation for generosity, volunteerism, and integrity that supports a \nfavorable assessment of her suitability for access to classified information. A fair and \ncommonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole shows the security \nconcerns about his finances are mitigated. \n \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n                                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Tr. at 24-25, 41-56, 61-68; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6-10) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the five dismissed bankruptcy cases; the foreclosure mortgage \nloan; the deficiencies owed on the auto loans after the vehicles were repossessed; \n$15,499 owed to the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) for the unearned \nportion of a reenlistment bonus; and four miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling \n$6,400. Except as addressed below, the allegations are established through credit \nreports and Applicant\u2019s admissions. \n \n \nApplicant lost his home to foreclosure in 2016. There is no evidence of any \ndeficiency. The debt is listed with a $0 balance by all three credit reporting agencies on \nthe January 2017 combined credit report. The two subsequent Equifax credit reports do \nnot list the debt. Additionally, Applicant recently bought a house financed with a \nmortgage loan through the bank that financed the house that was lost to foreclosure. \n(Tr. at 33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6-10) \n \n \nApplicant was paid a reenlistment bonus while in the military. When he was \ndischarged from the military, DFAS wanted $15,450, which is the unearned portion of \nhis reenlistment bonus, to be repaid. The debt was repaid through withholding of \nApplicant\u2019s income tax refunds. The debt is listed by Equifax and TransUnion on the \nJanuary 2017 combined credit report, and it is listed on the May 2018 Equifax credit \nreport. It is not listed on the March 2019 Equifax credit report. (Tr. at 26-27, 39, 70-72; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6-10; AE M) \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant defaulted on a car loan. The January 2017 credit report lists the loan as \n$5,008 past due with a $40,250 high credit and charged-off balance. That is the amount \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. However, the May 2018 Equifax credit report lists the charged-off \nbalance as $6,692, which presumably is the deficiency balance after the car was sold. \nApplicant contacted the creditor to obtain information about the debt, but he never \nreceived anything from the company. The debt is not listed on the March 2019 Equifax \ncredit report. (Tr. at 23-24; GE 6-9; AE K) \n \n \nApplicant made his final settlement payment on the $2,372 debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.i in June 2018. He made his final payment on the $550 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j in \nSeptember 2017. In July 2019, he paid in full the $3,860 deficiency balance owed on a \ncar loan (SOR \u00b6 1.l) after the car was repossessed. (Tr. at 29-31; GE 6-10; AE B, C, L) \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the $206 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. He asserted that he \npaid the debt several years ago. He contacted the creditor, but they had no listing of his \nname or Social Security number. The debt is listed by TransUnion on the January 2017 \ncombined credit report. It is not listed on the 2018 and 2019 Equifax credit reports. (Tr. \nat 30, 68; GE 6-9; AE K) \n \n \nApplicant paid $1,197 in May 2018 to resolve a debt in collection. He stated that \nit was for the $3,269 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m. That debt is listed by Experian on the \nJanuary 2017 combined credit report. It is not listed on the 2018 and 2019 Equifax \ncredit reports. The creditor that received the $1,197 payment does not appear on any \ncredit report. The account numbers for the two creditors are not the same. There is no \ndocumentary evidence that the two debts are the same. If they are not the same debt, \nhe paid a debt that was not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 31-33, 69; GE 6-10: AE I, J) \n \n \nApplicant stated that his finances are in better shape, and that he is smarter \nabout credit and managing his finances. He worked in Iraq and Kuwait for about 19 \nmonths, which helped him get back on his feet financially. He knows that financial \nstability is required for him to maintain his security clearance and job, which enables \nhim to support his children. The March 2019 credit report lists only one delinquent debt, \nthe $3,860 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l, which is now paid. The only balances on the \nreport are $687 and $194 for two credit cards, which are current. (Tr. at 33, 73-74, 79; \nGE 6-10) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n4 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n\n \n5 \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including dismissed Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy cases, a foreclosed home, repossessed vehicles, and delinquent debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to helping his father financially, \nunemployment, his cohabitant\u2019s failure to pay her share of the household\u2019s expenses, \nand their break-up, which eliminated her income from the household. His financial \nproblems were partially beyond his control, as he also bears responsibility. \n \n \nApplicant used his three most recent Chapter 13 bankruptcies in unsuccessful \nattempts to save his house from foreclosure. There is no evidence of any deficiency \nafter the foreclosure. Applicant completely paid the $15,499 DFAS debt, and he paid or \nsettled three other debts alleged in the SOR totaling $6,752. He paid $1,197 to resolve \none more debt, but that does not appear to be one of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nFactoring in that debt, he resolved $23,448 worth of delinquent debts. The remaining \nthree debts are not on Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report. Except for an SOR debt \nthat was paid after the credit report, there are no delinquent accounts on the report. \nApplicant stated that he is smarter about credit and managing his finances. He knows \nthat financial stability is required for him to maintain his security clearance and job, \nwhich enables him to support his children. \n \n  \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. A security clearance adjudication is not a debt-collection procedure. It is a \nprocedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). An applicant is not required, as \na matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. An applicant \nneed only establish a plan to resolve the financial problems and take significant actions \nto implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant make payments on all \ndelinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in the \nSOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008).  \n \n \nI believe Applicant is honest and sincere in his intentions to be financially \nresponsible. There are clear indications that the problem is being resolved and is under \ncontrol. I find that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he took significant \naction to implement that plan. Financial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns or pay his federal income taxes for the 2013 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.a); that he did not file his state income tax returns or pay his state income taxes for the 2013 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.b); and that he owed the IRS $18,461 in unpaid federal income taxes (SOR 1.c). It was further alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in November 2010 that was dismissed before completion in October 2012 (SOR 1.d); and that he owed five other delinquent or past-due debts totaling $10,237 (SOR 1.e \u2013 1.i). In response, Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e; he denied the remaining allegations.

He also \nowes at least $18,000 in unpaid federal income taxes, and accrued several delinquent or \npast-due debts since 2013. Although he experienced significant medical and personal \nproblems in 2013 and 2016, he did not establish that he has acted responsibly in the \nwake of those unforeseen circumstances. Applicant\u2019s inaction regarding his taxes and his \nother debts precludes a conclusion that the security concerns about his finances are \nmitigated. His request for security clearance eligibility is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 23, 2017, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain eligibility for a security clearance required for \nhis employment with a federal contractor. Based on the results of the ensuing background \n\n \n \n2 \n \n \ninvestigation, Department of Defense (DOD) adjudicators could not determine that it \nwould be clearly consistent with the interests of national security for Applicant to have a \nsecurity clearance, as required by Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section \nE.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended (Directive), Section 4.2. \n \n \nOn August 31, 2018, DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial considerations \n(Guideline F). Applicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing. \nI received the case on April 5, 2019, and convened the requested hearing on May 21, \n2019. The parties appeared as scheduled. Department Counsel proffered Government \nExhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 5, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified but did not \npresent any documentary evidence. I left the record open after the hearing to receive from \nApplicant additional relevant information. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJune 3, 2019. The record closed on June 6, 2019, when I received Applicant\u2019s timely post-\nhearing submissions, identified as Applicant Exhibits (AX) A \u2013 I, and Department \nCounsel\u2019s waiver of objection to the admissibility of Applicant\u2019s exhibits. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant did not file his federal \nincome tax returns or pay his federal income taxes for the 2013 through 2017 tax years \n(SOR 1.a); that he did not file his state income tax returns or pay his state income taxes \nfor the 2013 through 2017 tax years (SOR 1.b); and that he owed the IRS $18,461 in \nunpaid federal income taxes (SOR 1.c). It was further alleged that Applicant filed a \nChapter 13 bankruptcy petition in November 2010 that was dismissed before completion \nin October 2012 (SOR 1.d); and that he owed five other delinquent or past-due debts \ntotaling $10,237 (SOR 1.e \u2013 1.i). \n \n \nIn response, Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e; he \ndenied the remaining allegations. (Answer) Additionally, at the hearing, Department \nCounsel acknowledged that the debt at SOR 1.h was a duplicate of SOR 1.g and withdrew \nthe allegation at SOR 1.h. Accordingly, the total debt at issue in this case is $27,971. (Tr. \n43 \u2013 44, 52, 62 \u2013 63)  \n \n \nIn addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. Applicant is 53 years old and has been employed by a defense \ncontractor in State A since March 2017. Between September 2016 and March 2017, he \nworked for a different defense contractor in State B, where he had lived since at least \nMay 1990. Applicant and his wife have been married since September 1988 and have \none adult child together. This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. (GX \n1; Tr. 6) \n \n \nAs alleged in SOR 1.d, Applicant and his wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. They \ndid so to address their outstanding debts and to save their home in State B from \nforeclosure. Applicant had fallen behind on his mortgage, in part, due to mounting medical \n\n \n \n3 \n \n \nbills and an income reduction when he changed jobs in 2010 to avoid a lay off. As to the \nmortgage, it was a 15-year note that Applicant tried unsuccessfully to have modified to a \n30-year obligation for the lower monthly payments that would result. After almost two \nyears of paying off debts through the bankruptcy trustee, Applicant\u2019s only remaining \ndelinquent debt was the mortgage. Absent a mortgage modification, Applicant decided, \non advice of his bankruptcy attorney, to withdraw his bankruptcy petition and let the \nmortgage go to foreclosure. The bankruptcy was voluntarily dismissed in October 2012. \nApplicant has no remaining obligation from that mortgage because the house was sold at \nauction for more than the remaining balance on the loan. Thereafter, Applicant and his \nwife remained in State B until March 2017, when they moved to State A so he could take \nhis current defense contractor position. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 53 \u2013 55) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition showed that Applicant and his wife\u2019s assets \nexceeded their liabilities by $10,318. They also declared in their petition that they had a \nmonthly net cash flow of $944. (GX 5) \n \n \nIn 2013, Applicant suffered an injury at work that resulted in over six months of \nunemployment before and after surgery for a total hip replacement. In April 2014, \nApplicant did not file his federal or state income tax returns for the 2013 tax year. He \nmistakenly believed that he did not have to file if he knew he would receive a refund, and \nhe claims he did not file because he was overwhelmed with his health issues. Thereafter, \nApplicant did not file any of his federal or state income tax returns because he knew he \nwas behind and he did not know what to do about his situation. Further complicating \nmatters, he and his wife separated for about 18 months after his hip surgery. In 2016, \nafter they reconciled, Applicant\u2019s wife was diagnosed with cancer. Applicant has had \nmedical insurance at all times that has covered at least 80 percent of his hip surgery and \nhis wife\u2019s cancer treatment. Applicant is usually responsible for the remaining 20 percent \nof the costs. Those medical bills have strained his finances, and as a result, he incurred \nthe debts alleged at SOR 1.e \u2013 1.g, and 1.i. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 29 \u2013 31, 37) \n \n \nThe $7,673 debt at SOR 1.e is the remainder after resale of a car that was \nrepossessed from Applicant in March 2017. Applicant had purchased the car in 2002 for \nabout $17,000, but in 2016 started missing his monthly payments. He has been in contact \nwith the creditor collecting this debt, but Applicant has not yet made any documented \npayments on this debt. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 40 \u2013 42) \n \n \nThe unpaid cable television and internet bill for $990 at SOR 1.f arose when \nApplicant moved from State B to State A in 2017 and did not return the provider\u2019s \nequipment. Just before his hearing, he received boxes and labels with which to mail the \nequipment to the creditor but had not yet resolved this matter. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 42 \n\u2013 43) \n \n \nWhile he admitted he owes a debt for an unpaid cell phone bill as alleged at SOR \n1.g arose, Applicant disputes the $727 balance due listed in the SOR. This debt remains \n\n \n \n4 \n \n \nunpaid and Applicant is still trying to communicate with the creditor to resolve his dispute. \n(Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 43 \u2013 44) \n \n \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition, he owes the IRS $18,461 for unpaid \nincome taxes. Applicant avers he owes only about $3,000, but he did not present any \ninformation to support his claim. Applicant declared in his e-QIP that he had not filed his \nincome tax returns, as alleged in SOR 1.a and 1.b, since 2013. During a subject interview \nwith a government investigator on February 7, 2018, Applicant discussed his unfiled taxes \nand indicated he would hire an accountant to help him resolve the matter. On July 3, \n2018, Applicant answered interrogatories from DOHA Department Counsel about his \nunfiled taxes, indicating he was trying to get help in bringing his taxes up to date and to \nresolve his other debts. In his February 4, 2019, response to the SOR, Applicant stated \nthat he had contacted the IRS to get his returns filed and that he was seeking help to file \nhis state returns. At his hearing, Applicant testified he had contacted an accountant in \nState A and had a pending appointment to begin the process of filing all of his past-due \ntax returns. As of the hearing, Applicant had also not yet filed his 2018 return because \nthe accountant advised he would be filing all of his past-due tax returns at the same time. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 31 \u2013 36, 59 \u2013 64) \n \n \nThe IRS documents Applicant provided post-hearing as AX C \u2013 H are his W-2 \nWage and Tax Statements for the tax years 2013 through 2018. They do not establish \nthat he has filed any of the federal or state income tax returns addressed in SOR 1.a and \n1.b, or that he has addressed the tax debt alleged in SOR 1.c. The debt calculator he \nprovided as AX A is from an IRS web page and shows that he also owes at least $2,668 \nin unpaid taxes for the 2007 tax year. Applicant has also averred that his efforts to resolve \nhis IRS debts have been hampered by inaccurate personal information contained in his \nSocial Security Administration (SSA) records. A week after his hearing, he went to a local \nSSA office to correct that information. As of the close of this record, Applicant was \nawaiting a new Social Security card. (Answer; GX 2; AX I; Tr. 32 \u2013 33) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have sufficient monthly net income to meet all of their current \nexpenses. He testified that after moving to State A, his cost of living is greatly reduced. \nApplicant\u2019s wife has or is recovering from cancer, but she is unable to work and receives \nmonthly disability payments. After all of their expenses, they have about $500 remaining \neach month; however, they sometimes incur large medical co-payments associated with \nongoing monitoring of his wife\u2019s cancer recovery. Applicant and his wife manage their \nfinances together through a monthly budget. After the hearing, Applicant also presented \na letter of recommendation from the government division chief of the organization \nApplicant supports in his work. The author has known Applicant for the past six years and \nspeaks highly of Applicant\u2019s diligence, professionalism, and trustworthiness. (AX A; Tr. \n37, 44 \u2013 49) \n \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are:  \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988))  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations  \n \n \nApplicant has not filed his federal or state income taxes since 2013. He also \nincurred several unpaid debts since 2013 despite having previously resorted to federal \nbankruptcy protection between 2010 and 2012 because of previous financial problems, \nincluding a mortgage foreclosure. This information reasonably raised a security concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nI also have considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n\n \n \n7 \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAs shown by his 2010 bankruptcy petition and the subsequent loss of a house to \nforeclosure, Applicant\u2019s financial problems predate his claims that his current debts and \nfailure to file his income tax returns are tied to his 2013 hip surgery and his wife\u2019s 2016 \ncancer diagnosis. Although those events adversely impacted his finances, available \ninformation also shows that Applicant has not acted responsibly in the face of those \ncircumstances. As to his taxes, Applicant initially relied on an erroneous assumption that \nhe did not have to file a return if he knew he would receive a tax refund; however, after \nfailing to file for the 2013 tax year, he did not file because he knew he was behind and \nmay have been unsure of how to proceed in resolving his filing deficiencies. Neither \nexplanation is acceptable. Further, he has yet to take any tangible action to resolve his \ntax problems. He did nothing after submitting his May 2017 e-QIP, or after being \ninterviewed by a government investigator in early 2018, or after responding to \ninterrogatories in July 2018, or after responding to the SOR in February 2019. As of this \nhearing, Applicant had a pending appointment with an accountant to begin the process \nof filing all of his past-due returns. \n \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s debt for unpaid taxes, the record supports the SOR 1.c allegation \nthat he owes the IRS more than $18,000. Although not alleged, Applicant\u2019s AX B shows \nhe also owes the IRS for unpaid 2007 taxes. Applicant did not support his claim that his \nIRS debt is actually about $3,000. Either way, he has not acted to resolve his tax debt or \nany of the other debts alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nAll of the foregoing precludes application of any of the pertinent mitigating \nconditions under this guideline. On balance, Applicant did not produce information \nsufficient to mitigate the security concerns about his finances. \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \n \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has a good reputation in the workplace; however, that information \nis not enough to overcome the doubts about his judgment and reliability that reasonably \nensue from an examination of his financial problems and his failure to comply with his tax \nobligations. Because protection of the interests of national security is the principal focus \nof these adjudications, any remaining doubts must be resolved by denying eligibility for \naccess to sensitive information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.g, 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n Subparagraph 1.h: \n \nWithdrawn \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n                        \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n                \n",

He failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish \nmitigation with respect to his consumer debts and failure to file Federal tax returns. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 25, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented June 8, 2017.  \n02/05/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 17, 2018, and elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel \nsubmitted its file of relevant material (FORM) on September 12, 2018. Applicant received \nit on September 19, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 7. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM.1 Applicant submitted no response to the FORM within the time period allotted. \nItems 1 through 7 are admitted into the record. The case was assigned to me on January \n16, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR, with clarifications. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings \nof fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 52 years old and married. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2002. \nHe has worked for his employer, a government contractor, since September 2004. He \nserved on active duty in the Army from 1984 to 2004. (Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to seven creditors for over $40,000 in delinquent debt as \nlisted in the SOR. His consumer debts are established by credit reports dated October \n2017 and May 2018. He also failed to file his Federal income tax returns as required in \n2015 and 2016. His debt total includes approximately $4,000 owed to the IRS for the 2014 \nand 2015 tax years.2 He also owes an unstated amount to the IRS for tax year 2016. His \ndebts and delinquent tax filings are as follows. (Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant failed to pay his 2014 Federal income taxes. Applicant explained that he \nwas audited by the IRS for tax year 2013 and that he was working with a tax consultant \nto correct the 2013 filing, prior to filing 2014. He filed his 2014 Federal tax return in August \n2017. His 2014 IRS tax transcript, dated August 13, 2018, shows that at that time he owed \nthe IRS $2,213 for 2014. (Item 2.) \n \n \nApplicant failed to file and pay his 2015 and 2016 Federal income taxes, as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.b. Additionally SOR \u00b6 1.d alleged Applicant was indebted to the IRS for tax \nyear 2015 in the amount of $2,000. Applicant\u2019s 2015 IRS tax transcript, dated August 13, \n2018, reflected that his 2015 Federal return was filed August 10, 2017. He owed $2,762 \nfor 2015 at that time. Applicant did not produce a tax transcript for the 2016 tax year. \nThese is no evidence that he filed his Federal tax return for the 2016 tax year. (Item 2.) \n \n                                                          \n1 DoD Directive \u00b6 E3.1.7 requires responses to be submitted 30 days from receipt of the Government\u2019s \nFORM. The cover letter accompanying the case assignment indicated Applicant was given 45 days to \nsubmit a reply. He did not submit anything within either allotted time period. \n \n2 The SOR alleged that Applicant owed the IRS $6,000 for the 2014 tax year. However, a debt of $2,213 is \nreflected on the 2014 tax transcript. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant explained in his Answer that he pays the IRS $170 per month and will \ndo so \u201cuntil all taxes are paid in full.\u201d (Item 2.) The IRS also garnishes \u201cany refunds due \n[him] when [he] file[s] and put it towards overdue taxes.\u201d (Item 2.) He provided a \nscreenshot from his credit union account that documented one payment of $170 to the \nIRS in August 2018. His 2016 Federal tax returns appear to remain outstanding. (Item 2.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a judgment filed against him in November 2016 in the \namount of $5,969, as stated in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Applicant explained, \u201cMy wife took out credit \ncards in my name and I found out with a summons to court.\u201d He claimed to have set up a \npayment plan with this creditor to resolve the debt through monthly payments of $170. He \nprovided a screenshot from his credit union account that documented one payment of \n$170 and claimed it pertained to this debt. However, the creditor\u2019s name is different on \nthe statement. Without more information, I am unable to find that Applicant is resolving \nthis debt. (Item 2; Item 7.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off credit card in the amount of $12,964, as \nstated in SOR \u00b6 1.f. This debt became delinquent in 2016. Applicant attributed this debt \nto his wife taking out another credit card in his name, unbeknownst to him. He claimed to \nhave set up payment arrangements with this creditor to resolve the debt through monthly \npayments of $150. He provided a screenshot from his credit union account that \ndocumented one payment of $150 to a creditor of a different name. The evidence does \nnot establish that this payment necessarily pertained to this debt. This debt remains \nunresolved. (Item 2; Item 5; Item 6.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $7,182, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. This debt became delinquent in 2016. This was another credit card account \nopened without Applicant\u2019s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set \nup payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt \nis unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a past-due account in the amount of $365, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. This debt became delinquent in 2018. Applicant indicated that this debt is \nbeing garnished from his military retirement check. This debt is unresolved. (Item 2; Item \n6.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $5,930, as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.i. This debt became delinquent in 2015. This was another credit card account \nopened without Applicant\u2019s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set \nup payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt \nis unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $3,929, as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.j. This debt became delinquent in 2016. This was another credit card account \nopened without Applicant\u2019s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set \nup payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt \nis unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.) \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $542, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. This debt became delinquent in 2015. This was another credit card account \nopened without Applicant\u2019s knowledge by his wife. Applicant indicated he intended to set \nup payments to resolve this debt, but produced nothing further in that regard. This debt \nis unresolved. (Item 2; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s checking account screenshot dated August 13, 2018, reflected a \nbalance of $3.06. He appears to have few funds available to address his delinquencies \nor maintain solvency. (Item 2.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n& 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has over $40,000 in debt, which became delinquent between 2015 and \n2018. He failed to file his Federal income tax return for tax year 2016, and he filed returns \nfor 2014 and 2015 late. He is indebted on delinquent Federal taxes from 2014 and 2015 \nin an amount over $4,000. There is sufficient evidence to establish disqualification under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant has insufficient income to meet all of his financial obligations. There is \nno evidence that he will be able to avoid delinquent accounts in the future. He remains \nindebted on consumer accounts and has not provided evidence of filing his delinquent \n2016 tax return. His debt is ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to an IRS audit and to his wife opening \ncredit cards without his knowledge. The IRS audit does not excuse Applicant from his \nduty to file and pay Federal income taxes. His wife\u2019s actions can be considered \ncircumstances beyond his control. However, he failed to provide evidence that he \naddressed his delinquent consumer accounts in a reasonable and responsible manner \nonce he learned of them. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation of financial counseling, but he did utilize the \nassistance of a tax preparation firm to provide him guidance during and after the tax audit. \nEven so, the record lacks evidence to suggest that his financial problems are under \n\n \n7 \n \n \ncontrol. While he has documented single payments to some of his creditors and has filed \ntwo of three delinquent tax returns, he lacks a track record of consistent payments on his \nconsumer debts and to the IRS. The evidence does not establish full mitigation under AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not claim to dispute any of his alleged delinquencies. He admitted all \nof the allegations on the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant failed to show that he resolved his delinquent 2016 Federal tax returns. \nFurther, he documented only one $170 payment on over $4,000 of delinquent tax debt. \nThere is no documentation of a payment agreement with the IRS to resolve his remaining \nFederal tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not mitigate the security concern. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with the \npayments reflected on his August 2018 bank statement, and his efforts to file his \ndelinquent tax returns for 2014 and 2015. However, these efforts came after receiving the \nSOR and do not demonstrate a track record of responsible action. Further, he failed to \nmeet his burden to show he has acted responsibly by filing his 2016 tax returns. He may \nbe eligible for national security eligibility in the future if he is able to document reasonable \nand responsible actions toward resolving his outstanding Federal returns and maintain \nsolvency. At this time, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

On April 1, 2019, \n04/12/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nI notified Department Counsel that I intended to issue a summary disposition in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Department Counsel did not object.  \n \nThe SOR alleged 11 delinquent debts that are reflected in Applicant\u2019s credit \nreports. The debts were incurred due to his losses of a series of second jobs and a marital \nbreakup that left him with most of the marital debts and custody of his son, for whom he \nreceives no child support. When he answered the SOR, he had completed a financial \ncounseling course. He submitted evidence that three of the debts were paid before the \nSOR was issued, and he had negotiated payment agreements for two debts. He had \nreceived a settlement agreement for one debt which he intended to accept. He did not \nrecognize five debts and he asked the creditors to verify them.  \n \nAt the hearing, he had verified all the questionable debts. (Tr. 32) He submitted \ndocumentary evidence that he had paid all the debts except one, for which he was making \npayments under a payment agreement. (Tr. 34-41; AX A through J.) I conclude that \nApplicant presented sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F. \nThe mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are established.  \n \nApplicant has met his burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national security interests of the United States to continue his eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the security concerns stemming from his ties to the country of India during the \nsecurity clearance process. Accordingly, this case is decided for Applicant.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF 86 format) on February 20, 2016. This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. On August 22, 2018, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \n(DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the national \n03/08/2019\n\n2 \n \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.1 The SOR is similar to \na complaint in a civil court action. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the \nsecurity guideline known as Guideline B, Foreign Influence. Applicant answered the SOR \non September 10, 2018, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. The \ncase was assigned to me January 16, 2019. A notice of hearing was issued on January \n28, 2019, scheduling the hearing for February 22, 2019. Government Exhibits (GX) 1-2 \nwere admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified but presented no \ndocumentation. The transcript was received on March 4, 2019. Based on a review of the \npleadings, testimony and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.   \n \n \nProcedural Matters \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nregarding the Republic of India. Applicant did not object and the memorandum of \nadministrative notice and source documents were entered into the record as Government \nHearing Exhibit 1.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-g. These admissions  \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant provided explanations for the SOR \nallegations. \n \nApplicant is 50 years old and has an undergraduate degree in engineering from a \nuniversity in India. He was born in India, came to the United States in 1995, and was \nnaturalized in 2008. His spouse is a citizen of India, and is a permanent resident of the \nUnited States. (GX 1) She is applying for U.S. citizenship next month. (Tr. 13) Applicant \nand his wife have two children who were born in the United States. (Tr. 24) He has \nrenounced his Indian citizenship. He does possess an Overseas Citizen of India Card \n(OIC) card from India, which is used as a visa. He carries a U.S. passport. (Tr. 19) Since \n2012, he has been employed by a defense contractor. However, Applicant has been \nworking as a consultant in the field for many years. (GX 1) \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of India. She is a 70-year-old widow \nwho elects to remain in India. Applicant calls his mother every Sunday. He visits his \nmother and stays in her house when he travels to India.

I \ndecided the case using new AGs effective June 8, 2017, as well as the former guidelines, and my \nconclusions would be the same under either guideline.  \n \n\n3 \n \nclerk. (SOR 1 .e)   None of his relatives work for the Indian government or know the nature \nof Applicant\u2019s work. Applicant\u2019s only contact with the extended family members occurs \nwhen he visits his mother in India. (GX 2) He has called his one cousin a year ago to \nspeak about a loan. (Tr. 45) \n \nApplicant visited India about eight times from 2009 to 2016. His two children \nneeded speech therapy as they are not verbal and have special needs. In India they were \nable to attend speech therapy six days a week.  Applicant, his wife and children stayed \nfor seven months. Applicant has otherwise visited his family about every other year. (Tr. \n20)  He has never had any contacts with the Indian government or military. He has not \nvoted in any Indian elections. \n \nIn 1998, Applicant and his wife purchased property in India, with an estimated total \nvalue of approximately $360,000. (Tr. 30)  He and his wife own three houses and an \napartment. Applicant fully disclosed all possible financial interests in India on his security \nclearance. He believes the property has devalued about 15 to 20 percent. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant is in the process of liquidating the properties except for one home for his mother \nto live in. Applicant stated that one house is in the process of being sold and that there is \nan agreement in place with a deposit. (Tr.26) Applicant decided to sell the properties \nbecause he does not intend to return to India. (GX 2) \n \nApplicant provided loans for his family over the years estimated to be about \n$125,000. He stated that most of the loans have been repaid. His cousin used the money \nto send his son to university. (Answer) One cousin started a business with $30,000 that \nApplicant loaned him in 2009. (Tr.15) \n \n Applicant and his wife currently own a house in the United States that is worth \nabout $615,000. (Tr. 49) His current salary is about $225,000. He approximates assets \nin a value of about a million dollars. (Tr.50) He and his wife want to settle in his current \nstate as they want their two children to receive a fine education.  He was emphatic that \nthe United States is home now and forever. \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife speaks to her mother, who has always been a homemaker, every \nother day. (Tr. 33) Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law visited the United States in 2007 when \nApplicant\u2019s child was born. He communicates randomly with his wife\u2019s sisters, and his two \nbrothers-in-law. They work in private business and have no connections to the Indian \ngovernment. None of his wife\u2019s family know about his work. (GX 2) \n \n \nApplicant stated that his wife knows about the security clearance process. He \nrepeatedly stated that his oath of allegiance to the United States is one that he does not \ntake lightly. He votes in U.S. elections. Nothing could compel him to do something against \nthe United States. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \nAdministrative Notice (Republic of India) \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s request, to which Applicant did not object, I have \ntaken administrative notice of the following relevant facts about the Republic of India: \n \n\uf0b7 The 2000 and 2008 Annual Reports to Congress on Foreign Economic \nCollection and Industrial Espionage identified India as being involved in \neconomic collection and industrial espionage.  \n \n\uf0b7 In June 2013, a member of parliament in India and a close advisor to a now-\ndeceased chief minister was among those indicted by the U.S. Department of \nJustice for allegedly soliciting bribes for himself and other government officials \nin India in return for approving licenses to mine titanium minerals. \n \n\uf0b7 As of March 2016, India continued to experience terrorist and insurgent \nactivities. Anti-Western terrorist groups active in India, some of which are on \nthe U.S. government\u2019s list of foreign terrorist organizations, include Islamist \nextremist groups Harkat-ul-Jihad, Harakat ul-Mujahidin, Indian Myjahideen, \nJaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashker-e Tayyiba. \n \n\uf0b7 As of 2015, the most significant human rights problems involved police and \nsecurity force abuses, including extrajudicial killings, torture, and rape; \ncorruption remained widespread and contributed to ineffective responses to \ncrimes, including those against women, children, and members of scheduled \ncastes or tribes, and societal violence based on gender, religious affiliation, and \ncaste or tribe. Other human rights problems included disappearances, \nhazardous prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, and lengthy pretrial \ndetention. A lack of accountability for misconduct at all levels of government \npersisted, contributing to widespread impunity. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As noted \nby the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d3 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about \nwhether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved \nin favor of protecting national security.  \n \n                                                          \n2 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to \na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a \nsecurity clearance).  \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n\n5 \n \n \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted \na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.4 An \nunfavorable clearance decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing \nsecurity clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.5 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.6 The Government has the burden of presenting evidence \nto establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.7 An applicant is \nresponsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that \nhave been admitted or proven.8 In addition, an applicant has the ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9 \n \n \nIn Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is less than a \npreponderance of evidence.10 The Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and \na judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \n \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence) \n \nThe security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is set out in AG \u00b6 6, \nas follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a  foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether it is \n                                                          \n4 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n5 Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n \n6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n8 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n9 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \n \n10 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n11 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n\n6 \n \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nFour disqualifying conditions under this Guideline are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation \nto protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign  person, group, or country by providing that information or \ntechnology;  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement , manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n \nApplicant\u2019s close family ties to his mother, sisters and  members of his wife\u2019s family \nwho are a citizens and residents of India, and his financial interest in India establish AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), and 7(f).  A \u201cheightened risk\u201d is associated with India, given the \nsignificant human rights and terrorism problems existent there, and its history of economic \ncollection and industrial espionage. \n \nApplication of Guideline B is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism but merely \nan acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices \nthat could be important to a loved one, such as a family member.12 Family relationships \ncan involve matters of influence or obligation.13 Therefore, Applicant\u2019s family ties with his \nwife\u2019s family, property ownership, and other financial interests in India raise concerns for \nwhich he has the burden of persuasion to mitigate.14   \n                                                          \n12 ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd.

Dec. 15, 2000) (When an applicant\u2019s ties in a foreign country raise \na prima facie security concern, the applicant is required to present evidence of rebuttal, extenuation, or \nmitigation sufficient to carry his burden of persuasion that it is \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d \nto grant or continue a security clearance on his behalf). \n \n\n7 \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this Guideline are potentially relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or allegiance to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U. S. interest;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n \nFor the reasons set out in the discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e) and 7(f), above, \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established for the following reasons. Applicant has lived in the United \nStates since 1999. He was naturalized in 2009. His wife is a permanent resident of the \nU.S. who will become a U.S. citizen. He has two special needs children who are U.S. \ncitizens. Applicant visits his mother on a regular basis. None of his family or in-laws have \nconnections to the Indian government.  \n \nApplicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S. \nthat he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant\u2019s communications with his mother could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant\u2019s Indian bank accounts are dormant for \nthe most part. He will sell the Indian property that he and his wife own as soon as he is \nable. His brother in India is handling the affair. His financial status in the United States far \noutweighs the financial interests in India. His Indian property is not worth as much as his \nliquid assets in the United States.  Applicant has substantial retirement and savings \naccounts in the United States. He owns a home in the United States.  Applicant\u2019s property \ninterest in India are such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used \neffectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. I find that mitigating \nconditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b), 8(c), and  8(f) apply.  \n                                                          \n \n\n8 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nThe record does not create doubt about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I \nweighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed \nthe unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person \nconcept.15 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion \nto show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the SOR allegations: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n   For Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                    For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant Applicant access to classified information.  \n \n \n \nNoreen A.

On July 3, 2018, the Department of Defense issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) alleging facts that raise security concerns under Guidelines H and E. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \neffective within the Department of Defense on June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on August 15, 2018, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nSeptember 12, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nNotice of Hearing on September 13, 2018. I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nOctober 3, 2018. The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 and 2, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, DOHA received the \n\n \n2 \n \ntranscript of the hearing (TR) on October 11, 2018. The record was left open for the \nreceipt of additional evidence. On November 5, 2018, Applicant submitted a closing \nstatement. The record closed at that time. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He denied SOR allegation \u00b6 \n1.b. He both admitted, in part, and denied, in part, SOR allegation \u00b6 2.a. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 14 lines \n6~24, and GX 1 at page 7.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since \nOctober of 2016. \n \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse & Guideline E - Personal \nConduct \n \n \n1.a. and 2.a. Applicant used marijuana \u201czero to three, four times a year,\u201d from \nabout January of 2013 until about February of 2017, about two years ago. (TR at page \n15 line 16 to page 16 line 21, and at page 18 line 11 to page 20 line 13.) He still \nassociates with friends who use marijuana. (Id.) \n \n \n1.b. and 2.a. When Applicant was hired, he was aware of his employers \u201cdrug \npolicy.\u201d (TR at page 14 line 25 to page 15 line 15.) However, in his answer to Section 23 \nof his November 2016 SF-86, Applicant averred that he \u201cmight\u201d use marijuana in the \nfuture. (Id, and GX 1 at pages 27~28.) More recently, in his Answer, Applicant penned a \n\u201cStatement of Abstinence\u201d as to future \u201cdrug involvement.\u201d (Answer at page 2.) \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n  \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \nAppellant smoked marijuana over a period of about four years. Therefore, AG \u00b6 \u00b6 \n25 (a), and (c) are established.  \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was fairly recent. Although he has recently signed a \nstatement of intent to abstain from future use; he averred that he \u201cmight\u201d use it again in \nhis November 2017 SF-86, and he still associates with at least one friend who uses \nmarijuana. I find that his commitment is questionable. Guideline H is found against \nApplicant.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n  \nApplicant has a pattern of rule violations as evidenced by his marijuana usage. \nFurthermore, he still associates with at least one marijuana user. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nNeither of these mitigating conditions apply. His last usage was two years ago, \nand a current friend is a user of the illegal substance. Guideline E is found against \nApplicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug \nInvolvement and  Substance Misuse, Personal Conduct security concerns.  \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on March 11, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted the sole allegation contained in the SOR and \nprovided an explanation for the debt. (Answer)  \n \n \nApplicant is 43 years old and divorced since 2004. He and his former wife have \ntwo children, ages 20 and 16. He has joint custody and provides financial support for the \nchildren. He attended college between 1996 and 1997. He enlisted in the Army in June \n1997 and served until he was honorably discharged in June 2000, as an E-4. He held a \nsecurity clearance while serving. While serving, he was awarded soldier of the month. \n(Tr. 16-17; GE 1, GE 5; AE B)  \n \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). He listed full employment from January 2001 until April 2016. He \ndisclosed that he failed to file or pay Federal and state tax returns for tax year 2009. He \nestimated that he owed about $13,000. He stated that he had an installment agreement \nwith the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to pay the debt while he was employed. However, \nafter being laid off in April 2016, he was unable to make the payments. He further \ndisclosed that he was filing an Unable to Pay Status form with the IRS. He stated that he \nhad joined a credit repair service to improve his credit score. (GE 1) \n \n \nIn February 2018, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about the \nbackground information he provided in his e-QIP. During the interview, the investigator \ninformed Applicant that the IRS had filed a $17,003 lien against him in May 2012.2 \nApplicant agreed, and said that the tax debt was the same debt he disclosed in his e-QIP. \nApplicant stated that the debt\u2019s balance was $13,000 because he had been making \nmonthly payments of $500, until he lost his job in April 2016. (GE 5) He did not provide a \ndocument confirming that balance. \n \n                                            \n1Per my request, Applicant agreed to submit the following information: the initial amount of the IRS tax lien \nfiled in May 2012; the tax years included in that lien; and the current balance owed on that tax lien. (Tr. 33, \n40)   \n \n 2Applicant testified that this lien may have been over $20,000 at some point. (Tr. 32)  \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant worked full-time from January 2001 to April 2016, at which time he was \nlaid off. (GE 1) He was then unemployed until about August 2017 when he took a position \nas a truck driver. He worked for two months and left in October 2017 to find a better \npaying position. He remained unemployed until he started a position in February 2019. \n(Tr. 24; GE 5)  \n \n \nApplicant stated his tax problem began after he and his wife divorced in 2004, \nwhich created some tax confusion. In 2009, he hired a tax consultant to prepare his tax \nreturns for years 2006 through 2009. After retrieving his returns from the consultant, he \ndid not review the prepared returns or other documents, and instead mailed the sealed \nenvelope directly to the IRS. The IRS audited him and filed a lien against him in May 2012 \nfor about $17,000. That lien remains unpaid and represents monies owed for those years \nthree years and possibly more. (Tr. 19-24)  \n \n  \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file his Federal 2010 and 2011 income \ntax returns, and he may owe taxes for those years as part of the 2012 lien. (Tr. 19-24) He \nsaid he timely filed his 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 Federal taxes. (Tr. 28)  \n \n \nApplicant testified he filed his Federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018, \non February 27, 2019, the day before his hearing. 3  (Tr.23, 28). He believes he will receive \na tax refund of about $7,285 for 2016 and 2017. He said that refund will be applied to the \noutstanding IRS lien. (Tr. 30-31) He stated that he did not file those returns sooner \nbecause he was unable to prepare them himself and he could not afford to hire a tax \nconsultant or pay any outstanding taxes. (Tr. 29)  \n \n \n \nApplicant stated he initially entered into a payment plan with the IRS to resolve the \n2012 lien either in 2012 or 2013 and began making monthly payments of about $560. He \nsaid he made those payments until he was laid off in April 2016. (Tr. 26) His tax exhibits \ndo not confirm that he consistently made payments over those years. There is evidence \nthat he made monthly installment payments as follows: $100 in September, October, and \nDecember 2010; $100 in January, March, and April 20114; $376 in March, April, and June \n2013; $386 in July through December 2014; $386 from January through October 2015; \nand $386 in January, February, and March 2016. (AE C through G)  \n \n \n \nApplicant thinks he initially owed the IRS about $20,000. (Tr. 32-33) He said he \nfiled all of his state income returns. He does not believe that he owes the state unpaid \ntaxes because he has not received communication from it regarding the matter. (Tr. 35-\n36)  \n \n \n                                            \n3The SOR did not allege security concerns related to the late filing of Applicant\u2019s Federal tax returns for \n2010, 2011, 2016, and 2017. Those derogatory facts will not be considered in analyzing pertinent \ndisqualifying conditions. They may be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility, and analyzing \nmitigating conditions and the whole-person concept.  \n \n4There is no information in this record pertinent to any installment agreement on which Applicant was \nmaking payments in 2010 and 2011, prior to the filing of the 2012 lien. \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nApplicant submitted a budget based on his new job. His annual salary is about \n$72,592. His net monthly pay is $3,600 and expenses are $2,435. He established another \npayment plan with the IRS in March 2018 to address the outstanding lien. It is scheduled \nto start on May 5, 2019, and requires a $346 monthly payment. Applicant included the \npayment in his monthly expenses. (Tr. 29; AE B, AE I) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nIn May 2012, the IRS filed a tax lien against Applicant for over $17,000. Applicant \nthinks it included unpaid taxes for tax years 2006 to 2009, and possibly subsequent tax \nyears. The debt is not resolved. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out four conditions that could potentially mitigate \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 tax lien remains unresolved and ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. There is some evidence that Applicant\u2019s initial tax problem may have arisen as a \nconsequence of his 2004 divorce. However, two years after the divorce he failed to file \nand pay taxes for years 2006 through 2009, and later. Those years were within his control. \nHe was fully employed from January 2001 until April 2016, when he was laid off, which \nwas a circumstance beyond his control. He subsequently obtained a job in 2017 that he \nquit after working two months. From 2010 into 2016, he attempted to manage his IRS \ndebts through payment plans. However, those payments were inconsistent. The evidence \nestablishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant hired a credit repair company to improve his credit score. It is unknown \nif that company also provided credit counseling. Although he recently initiated a payment \nplan with the IRS, the evidence is insufficient to conclude that his tax problems are under \ncontrol or that he is in compliance with the new repayment agreement. The evidence \nestablishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g).   \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old man, who honorably served in the Army for three years. \nHe has a history of Federal tax problems, which began in 2006 and continued into 2012 \nor 2013 when he began addressing a tax lien for unpaid paid taxes for prior years. He \nadmitted that he failed to timely file his 2010 and 2011 Federal tax returns, and his 2016 \nand 2017 Federal tax returns, which he filed the day before his hearing. A month after his \nhearing, he arranged another repayment plan with the IRS to resolve the outstanding \ndebt. It starts in May 2019. He agreed to submit information from the IRS documenting \nthe initial amount of the lien, the years included in it, and the current balance of the lien, \nbut did not do so. The record does not contain sufficient information to clarify the status \nof his Federal taxes. \n \nApplicant has not established a sufficient record of responsibly managing his \ntaxes. He has not made a payment to the IRS for three years. His history of non-\ncompliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely file tax returns and pay tax debts \nraises security concerns. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec.

It alleges that he was delinquently indebted to the U.S. Government for $345,660 \nfor tax years 2010 through 2014 and $72,657 in business trust fund taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n1.g). It alleges that he was delinquently indebted to a county tax authority in state C for \n$11,098 in real estate taxes and $1,356 in unpaid taxes, and to the state C tax authority \nfor $2,638 in unpaid taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.i, 1.j). It alleges that he was delinquently \nindebted to the state A tax authority for $6,301 in employee withholding tax, an unpaid \ntax assessment of $5,847, and $4,263 in unpaid taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.h 1.k). It alleges \nthat he was delinquently indebted to the state B tax authority for an unpaid tax \nassessment of $5,398, $472 in state unemployment taxes, and a $27,258 judgment \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.l). The SOR also alleges that he falsified his September 2017 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) by responding \u201cNo\u201d to section 26, which inquired \nwhether he had failed to file or pay required federal, state, or other taxes within seven \nyears of completing his SCA (SOR \u00b6 2.a).  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife previously owned an independent contracting business in \nstate C, where they live, from approximately 2006 to 2016. During this period, his \nestimated annual salary was $80,000; he was unaware how much his wife earned. He \ntestified that it was his wife\u2019s responsibility to work with their certified public accountants \n(CPAs) and tax attorneys in managing all of their finances, to include their taxes, as he \nworked 40 to 50 hours weekly primarily in states A and B. He cites to her failure to do so \nresponsibly that led to his bankruptcy and delinquent taxes. He testified that she also \nspent money irresponsibly, to include charging upwards of $30,000 on their credit cards, \nhaphazardly spending a $300,000 business loan, and misspending money he had given \n\n \n3 \n \nher for their mortgage. He testified that though their home and business address were \nthe same, he did not see mail concerning their delinquent taxes or understand the depth \nof their financial problems until late 2015, approximately six months before they filed \nbankruptcy. He also cites to bad advice from tax attorneys and CPAs as a reason for his \nfinancial issues. Between 2013 and 2017, he traveled for pleasure to the Bahamas four \ntimes, and to Costa Rica, Mexico, and Canada. (Tr. at 43-103; GE 1, 2, 3; AE KK, LL, \nL). \n \n \nApplicant and his wife initially filed joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy in July 2016. He \nsevered their bankruptcy case in December 2017 and has since proceeded as an \nindividual debtor. His delinquent federal, county, and state A and C taxes are listed in \nhis bankruptcy (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d, 1.g-1.k). As of the date of the hearing and since \nDecember 2017, he made 30 months of payments at $400 monthly towards his \nbankruptcy and the bankruptcy court had not yet approved his plan. (Tr. at 43-103; GE \n1, 2, 3, 4; AE BB, CC, FF, KK, LL, I, K, L, M, O, S). \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his delinquent state B taxes, to include the state B \njudgment of $27,258, remain unresolved. He hoped to resolve them through his divorce \nand bankruptcy proceedings (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.l). He was unaware of the outstanding \nliability, if any, for his state C taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015, which he expected to \nfile promptly after the hearing date. He has owned his home since 2005. He testified \nthat his mortgage became delinquent because no payments were made for \napproximately one year and a half. He testified that he was advised by his bankruptcy \nand divorce attorneys not to make any mortgage payments for that duration because he \nwas attempting to switch the mortgage to solely his name without a quitclaim deed. He \ntestified that as of the date of the hearing, he was attempting to obtain a quitclaim deed \nthrough the divorce process. He testified that he entered into a trial loan modification of \n$2,000 monthly from February through April 2019; he made the payments for February \nand March 2019; he did not foresee any issue with making the April 2019 payment; and \nhe hoped to be approved for a modified loan with the delinquent balance tacked onto it. \nHe testified that he did not have any other delinquent debts. (Tr. at 43-103; GE 1, 2, 3,               \n4; AE BB, KK, LL, K, M, O, S). \n \n \nApplicant testified that his ongoing divorce is a contested one, primarily due to \nthe allocation of debts that were incurred during their marriage. He received financial \ncounseling through his bankruptcy in February 2016. He testified that he has also \nreceived financial counseling from his bankruptcy attorney and CPA. He testified that he \nrelies on himself, his CPA, his bankruptcy attorney, as well as a payroll firm whom he \nhired in late December 2018, to keep all of his personal and business finances \norganized and current. He testified that he filed his taxes for tax year 2018. He \nacknowledged that he should have taken more responsibility with his finances sooner \nthan he did. He signed a statement of intent to file and pay his required federal and \nstate taxes in the future. (Tr. at 43-103; AE DD, EE, HH, J, N, O). \n \n \nApplicant earns $60,000 annually. He is rated 30% disabled by the U.S. \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, for which he receives $500 monthly. His total net \nmonthly income is approximately $4,020, and his total net monthly remainder after \n\n \n4 \n \nexpenses is approximately $300. He depleted all of his retirement accounts with his \nbankruptcy, with the exception of approximately $10,000 in his children\u2019s 529 college \nsavings plans. He testified that he is loyal to the United States. (Tr. at 43-103; AE N, O, \nT). \n \n \nAppellant testified that he did not intend to deceive by failing to affirmatively \nanswer \u201cYes\u201d to the portion of section 26 of his 2017 SCA that inquired whether he had \nfailed to file or pay required federal, state, or other taxes within seven years of \ncompleting his SCA. He testified that evidence of his lack of intent to deceive is \ndemonstrated by his disclosure of his bankruptcy, in which he had listed his delinquent \ntaxes, in the same SCA. Specifically, he listed that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \nJuly 2016, with a total amount of $230,000 involved in the bankruptcy, and indicated \nthat not all of his debts were discharged and some had to be repaid. He made no \nmention of his delinquent taxes in this portion of his response. He discussed his \nbankruptcy and delinquent taxes during his April 2018 background interview. (Tr. at 58-\n60; GE 1, 2; AE KK, LL).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy attorney testified. Applicant hired her in December 2018 \nto replace his previous bankruptcy attorney, who was conflicted from representing both \nApplicant and Applicant\u2019s wife due to their ongoing divorce proceedings and the \ncontinuing nature of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. She testified that Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy \nwas pending as of the date of the hearing; she was scheduled to file an amended plan \nwithin approximately 30 days of the date of the hearing, after having facilitated with \nApplicant and his CPA the filing of his local taxes to state C for 2014 and 2015; and she \nexpected that Applicant\u2019s plan would then be up for approval by the bankruptcy court. \nShe testified that there had been contested issues with the bankruptcy because there \nare two debtors, Applicant and his wife, and they have to find a way to pay the required \ntax claims that is agreeable to both debtors, their respective attorneys, and the taxing \nauthorities. She testified that Applicant addressed the tax claims made by the IRS and \nstates A and C in his bankruptcy. Though he did not address any tax by state B \nbecause no such claims had been filed by that state tax authority, she testified that she \nintended to follow up with state B to determine why they were delinquent in not filing a \nclaim. She wrote: \n \n[Applicant] is now well on his way to financial fidelity and back on track to \ngetting his financial house in order. . . . I am confident now that with my \nhelp and my firms help he will no longer face the kind of financial \ndifficulties that his ex-wife left him to handle and clean up over the last \nthree years.  \n \n(Tr. at 21-42, 58; AE II, A, L, M, N, Q, R, S). \n \n \nMultiple character references attested to Applicant\u2019s honesty, integrity, and \nreliability. He received the Navy Achievement Medal, Good Conduct Medal, Navy \nReserve Meritorious Service Medal, and various unit awards. (Tr. at 21-42, 58; AE II, JJ, \nA, B, F, P, Q, R, S).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file pay his taxes to the federal government and to \nstates A, B, and C from approximately 2006 to 2016. He owes a significant amount in \nback taxes as a result, which he is attempting to resolve through his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(f) as disqualifying \nconditions.  \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nIt is well established that failure to comply with tax laws suggests that an \napplicant has difficulty with abiding by government rules and regulations. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). It is also well established that \nthe mere filing of past-due returns or resolution of delinquent tax debts does not compel \na favorable security-clearance adjudication. ISCR Case No. 17-01907 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2018). The timing of corrective action is an important factor in determining whether \nsecurity concerns raised by tax delinquencies are mitigated. Applicants who wait until \ntheir clearances are in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment \nexpected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). \n \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely pay his taxes did not happen so long ago, was not \ninfrequent, and did not occur under such circumstances that are unlikely to recur. It \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 \n20(a) is not established.  \n \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely pay his taxes. Thus, the first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under his circumstances. He acknowledged that he should have taken more \nresponsibility with his finances sooner than he did. As such, AG \u00b6 20(b) is not \nestablished. \n \nApplicant has attempted to resolve his financial delinquencies through his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy. He received financial counseling through the bankruptcy \nprocess as well as from his bankruptcy attorney and CPA. Though he has made \nconsistent payments into his bankruptcy plan since his filing, the plan was not yet \napproved as of the date of the hearing and his outstanding liabilities remained \nunresolved. As such, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are not established.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 16. \nThe disqualifying condition potentially applicable in this case includes:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities \n \n Applicant credibly testified that he did not intentionally falsify his response to \nsection 26 of his SCA when he did not disclose his delinquent taxes. He credibly \ntestified that he believed he had disclosed his delinquent taxes by disclosing his \nbankruptcy, since his delinquent taxes were listed as part of his bankruptcy. I find that \nAG \u00b6 16(a) has not been established and I find SOR \u00b6 2.a for Applicant.    \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \n\n \n9 \n \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude that Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security \nconcern, but he did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \n \n  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. He provided one document, marked as \n                                                          \n1 The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.

On August 23, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 5. Applicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant\u2019s undated FORM response was \nreceived by the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 4, 2018. He \ndid not object to the Government\u2019s evidence.2 He included six new documents, marked \nas AE B \u2013 G.3 The SOR and the Answer (Items 1 and 2) are the pleadings in the case. \nItems 3 through 5 and AE A \u2013 G are admitted into evidence without objection.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.k, with a brief narrative statement. I have \nincorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old. He married in 2010. He and his wife separated in 2014, \nthough they remain legally married. They have no children. Applicant graduated from high \nschool in 2005. He took online courses from 2011 to 2014, but did not obtain a degree. \nHe has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since February 2017. He \nheld his previous job from 2010 to January 2017. (Item 1) \n \n \nApplicant disclosed on his October 2017 SCA that he had $62,000 in past-due \nfederal student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.j), and an $805 overdue local tax debt from 2016. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k). He said his debts were due to low income. (Item 3) \n \n \nApplicant noted in his Answer that his tax debt had increased to $1,200. He made \na $400 payment in August 2018, and intends to continue making payments to resolve the \ndebt. (Answer; FORM Response; AE C; AE D) \n \nApplicant\u2019s ten delinquent federal student loans are alleged as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($8,049), 1.b ($4,842), 1.c ($7,793), 1.d ($7,680), 1.e ($8,383), 1.f ($4,739), 1.g ($5,869), \n1.h ($4,796), 1.i ($3,636) and 1.j ($6,746). They are listed on his October 2017 credit \nreport, and total $62,533. This is comparable to what Applicant disclosed on his SCA \n($62,081). The credit reports reflect that Applicant received the loans between 2011 and \n2014, when he was taking online courses. He reported on his SCA that the student loans \nhad been delinquent since 2013. (Items 1, 3, 4) \n \n                                                          \n2 In his FORM Response, Applicant \u201cobjected\u201d to certain statements made by Department Counsel in the \nFORM. I do not construe those comments as formal objections to admission of the Government\u2019s evidence.  \n  \n3 AE A is a July 2018 statement from Applicant\u2019s student loan provider. AE B reflects his student loan \npayments as of September 2018. AE C and AE D concern payments on a local tax debt. AE E is Applicant\u2019s \nstudent loan rehabilitation agreement, signed August 31, 2018. AE F and AE G are statements from his \nstudent loan provider, from August and September 2018.  \n \n\n3 \n \nThe principal on Applicant\u2019s federal student loans is $58,364. (AE A, AE F, AE G) \nAs of July 2018, he owed an additional $6,376 in interest and penalties, plus $15,757 in \nfees and costs, for a total balance of about $80,500. (AE A)  \n \nOn July 31, 2018, the day after he answered the SOR, Applicant entered into a \nloan rehabilitation agreement with his loan provider. The agreement noted that his federal \nstudent loans were in default. He was to make nine monthly payments of $5.00 each \nmonth to rehabilitate his loans and bring them out of delinquent status. (Answer; AE E) \nHis loans remained delinquent, with increased balances, as of September 2018. (Item 5; \nAE F; AE G) \n \nApplicant made a $105 payment on May 1, 2018. He made a $53 payment on July \n17, 2018. He made a $5.00 payment on August 16, 2018, and another $5.00 payment on \nSeptember 18, 2018. All of Applicant\u2019s payments were applied to interest and fees, and \nnot to the principal on the loan. (AE B) \n \nApplicant\u2019s most recent statement from his student loan provider is dated \nSeptember 11, 2018 (between the two $5.00 payments). As of that date, the amount he \nowed in interest had increased to about $6,829, and the amount he owed in fees and \ncosts had increased to $15,868. Thus, Applicant\u2019s total loan balance owed had increased \nto $81,061. (AE G) \n \n \nApplicant noted in his FORM Response that he now earns $13.05 an hour. This is \na $4.05 increase from his prior hourly rate. (FORM Response). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.4 As the \nSupreme Court noted in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d5 \n \n \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \n                                                          \n4 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 \nto a security clearance\u201d).  \n \n5 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation.6 \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides financial conditions that could raise security concerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19 \n(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) \nare applicable, given Applicant\u2019s delinquent federal student loans and the tax debt.7 \n \n                                                          \n6 See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n7 SOR \u00b6 1.k concerns past-due property taxes rather than local income taxes, so AG \u00b6 19(f) (\u201c . . . failure \nto pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d) does not technically apply.  \n \n\n5 \n \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \n \n \nApplicant took out about $58,000 in student loans during the three years he took \nonline courses, from 2011 to 2014. He did not obtain a degree. He now owes over \n$65,000 in principal and interest on the loans. With fees and costs, he owes over $80,000.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s inability to pay his debts more responsibly is due largely to his limited \nincome. This is a condition beyond his control, so AG \u00b6 20(b) partially applies. However, \nto receive full credit, he must show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nHe only recently began to address his debts, making a few small payments. His debts will \nremain in delinquent status until he completes nine months\u2019 worth of $5.00 payments. \n \n \nThe payment arrangement Applicant has made with his student loan provider may \nbe enough to bring his federal student loans out of delinquent status. However, it is not \nenough to keep his total loan balance owed from increasing. Applicant has yet to establish \na track record of addressing his federal student loan debt in a responsible manner. To do \nso, he needs to make enough payments so that it begins to decrease. Until he does that, \nhe will not have shown that his student loans are at a level that he can afford to address \nresponsibly. Applicant has not provided sufficient evidence that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), or \n20(d) should apply to mitigate his federal student loan debts, which remain ongoing, \ndelinquent and significant.  \n \n \nApplicant intends to resolve his property tax debt, has a plan in place, and has \nmade one $400 payment. He has shown sufficient evidence that AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to \nmitigate SOR \u00b6 1.k.  \n \n \n\n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Put simply, it is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate \nthe security concerns shown by his significant federal student loan debt, which remains \ndelinquent, and he has not done so. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I \nconclude that Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:   \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \n       \n_____________________________ \nBraden M. Murphy \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He \nowes a Federal agency a large debt for the overpayment of benefits he received. He did \nnot mitigate the resulting financial security concerns. National security eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 20, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n04/23/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 24, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge (Answer). The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on February 7, 2019. On February 12, 2019, \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing setting the hearing for February 26, 2019. The hearing \nwas held as scheduled. Applicant waived his right to 15 days of notice of the date, time, \nand location of his hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 9))  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered five exhibits. Applicant did not did \nnot object to the Department\u2019s exhibits, or offer any exhibits on his own behalf. The \nDepartment\u2019s exhibits were admitted into evidence. The record remained open until \nMarch 15, 2019, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional documents. None \nwere provided. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing on March 6, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the three allegations contained in the SOR. He provided \ndocuments related to the allegations with his Answer.  \n \n \nApplicant is 58 years old and married to his wife for 30 years. He has three adult \nchildren. He has been working in the field of welding since he was 20 years old. He began \nhis current position, as a welder, with a defense contractor two years ago. Prior to this \njob, he worked for private companies. (Tr. 18-21) \n \n \n In May 2017, Applicant submitted an electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP). In it, he disclosed that he failed to file Federal and state tax returns \nfor tax year 2015. He also disclosed that he owed the Social Security Administration \n(SSA) $33,575 for overpayments he received for disability benefits. (GE 1) During an \nOctober 2018 interview with a government investigator, Applicant volunteered that he had \nnot filed tax returns for 2007, 2008, 2009, and a couple other years. He stated that he \nhad received social security disability (SSI) benefits for a couple years following hernia \nsurgery, and owed the SSA about $33,000 in overpayments. He said he was repaying \nthe debt with monthly payments of $10. (GE 5) \n \n \nApplicant testified that his tax filing problems began with tax year 2007. He did not \ntimely file those returns because he did not think he would have enough money to pay \nhis taxes, and then he began procrastinating year after year. At some point, he thought \nhe may be dead before he needed to pay his taxes because he had begun to use heroin. \nHe continued to use heroin into 2010 when he sought treatment and stopped using the \nillegal substance. He also had cardiac surgery around the same time. (Tr. 22-23, 26) He \nadmitted that his tax problems eventually \u201cspiraled out of control.\u201d (Tr. 24)  \n \n \nApplicant began collecting disability after his 2010 surgery. He received payments \nduring 2011, 2012, and 2013, during which time he was also working. He thought he could \nearn more money than the regulations permitted while on disability. Subsequently, he \nreceived notice that he owed the SSA over $33,000. He said he established a monthly \nrepayment plan of $50 in 2016. That amount was reduced to $10 a month in October \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n2018 after he was laid off from a position. As of October 2018, the balance was $33,395, \nand his monthly payments were listed as $10. (Tr. 27-31; Answer) \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he did not timely file Federal and state income tax returns \nfor the following years: 2007, 2008, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016. (Tr. 34, 39, 41, \n44-49) All of those returns were filed between October and November 2018.1 (Tr. 39, 50, \n54) He has not filed Federal or state income tax returns for 2009 due to some confusion \nwith the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which filed a return for him and assessed unpaid \ntaxes for 2009. (Tr. 44, 50) He timely filed tax returns for 2006, 2012, 2014, and 2017. \n(Tr. 45, 47, 50) \n \n \nApplicant owes the IRS about $13,000 for unpaid taxes for years: 2007, 2008, \n2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, and 2016. He does not know how much he owes for 2017. 2  (Tr. \n50-51) He recently requested a payment plan with the IRS. He offered to make monthly \npayments of $100 to the IRS. He has not received a response. (Tr. 51)  \n \n \nApplicant owes his state department of revenue about $475 for unpaid income \ntaxes for the above-alleged years. He has not contacted the state to establish a payment \nplan, but is waiting to hear from it. (Tr. 52-54) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n                                            \n1Initially, Applicant sent his unfiled Federal tax returns to the IRS in September 2018; however, some of \nthem were unsigned and the IRS returned them to him for his signature. He resubmitted those returns \nbetween October and November 2018. He filed his state returns at the same time.  \n \n2I have not considered for disqualifying purposes any derogatory information that was not alleged in the \nSOR regarding Applicant\u2019s unpaid taxes. I may consider the information when making a credibility \ndetermination, in applying the mitigating conditions, and in analyzing the whole-person concept.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file Federal and state income tax returns for tax years: \n2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2016. He incurred a debt with the SSA \nafter receiving overpayments for his disability in 2011, 2012, and 2013, which he was not \nentitled to receive. That debt has a large outstanding balance and is being minimally \naddressed. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of the disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of \nthe security concerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out four conditions that could potentially mitigate \nfinancial security concerns under this guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant did not timely file Federal and state tax returns for eight years between \n2007 and 2016. His failure to timely file those years until the fall of 2018 casts doubt on \nhis current judgment and reliability. He continues to owe the SSA a large amount of \nmoney for disability payments that he was not entitled to receive. AG \u00b6 20(a) minimally \napplies.  \n \nApplicant acknowledged that his heroin addiction and procrastination contributed \nto his failure to timely file tax returns. Those were circumstances within his control. He did \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nnot provide a sufficient or credible explanation for receiving disability payments for three \nyears while he was working. The evidence does not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nIn 2016, Applicant began repaying SSA $50 a month for disability payments that \nhe wrongly received between 2011 and 2013. There is no exhibit confirming the original \namount owed to the SSA or documenting the payments, he said he made for two years. \nIn October 2018, that payment amount was reduced to $10 a month. There is no \ndocument confirming that he made those payments up to February 26, 2019, the date of \nthe hearing. The evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). As of this \nhearing, Applicant has not entered into a payment plan for unpaid Federal and state \nincome taxes. AG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old man who has worked for a defense contractor for two \nyears. Prior to obtaining this position, he had a long history of failing to file or pay Federal \nand state income taxes. Between September and November 2018, he filed eight years of \nreturns. He has not established payment plans for his unpaid taxes. He said he has been \nmaking small payments to the SSA for monies that he wrongfully obtained; however, he \ndid not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that those payments have been consistent \nover the years or the amount of the original debt. Applicant has not established a track \nrecord of responsibly managing taxes and other financial obligations. His history of non-\n\n \n \n \n \n7\ncompliance with a fundamental legal obligation to file tax returns and timely pay tax debts \nraises security concerns. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that:  \n \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 61-year-old married father with two adult children. He has worked for his defense-contractor employer since August 1983. In 2010, he assumed the duties of alternate COMSEC custodian for the engineering department at his facility, and he transitioned into the role of lead COMSEC custodian by 2014. Applicant held a Secret clearance from November 1993 until June 2010, when it was upgraded to Top Secret. 3 That clearance was renewed most recently in April 2015. (GEs 1, 3; AEs E-F, H; Tr. 52- 54.) He works in a building where all employees are required to possess a minimum of a DOD Secret clearance (Tr. 39, 55, 67), and he has had security training on an annual basis over the years. (Tr. 55-56.) Applicant had an unblemished record for any security infractions before he took on COMSEC custodian duties at the request of his then supervisor. (Tr. 69, 73.) The supervisor considered Applicant the best candidate because of his reputation, his administrative skills, and his integrity. (Tr. 74.) While leaving work one day in late August 2013, Applicant failed to spin an X-09 lock on the door to a stand-alone COMSEC closed area that housed COMSEC equipment for multiple satellite communications programs.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n07/16/2019 \nDecision \nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge: \nWhile serving as custodian for a high volume of communications security \n(COMSEC) material, Applicant neglected to secure a safe in the COMSEC room, a \nstand-alone closed area, in March 2017. Sometime after February 2015, he lost a \nclassified Secret controlled cryptographic item that was within his accountability. He did \nnot report the item as missing for some two years because he believed it would be \nfound. He has a positive attitude toward the discharge of his security responsibilities, and \nhe has shown that he can handle classified information appropriately. Clearance is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 3, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline K, handling protected information, and explaining \nwhy it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue his access to classified information. The DOD CAF took the action under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \n\n2 \n \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nOn November 8, 2018, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA). On April 9, 2019, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing \nto determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or \ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant. On April 15, 2019, I scheduled a hearing for \nMay 8, 2019. \n \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Before the introduction of any evidence, \nthe Government moved to amend the SOR under \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive. Applicant \nhad no objection, and I granted the motion, as set forth below. Six Government exhibits \n(GEs 1-6) were admitted in evidence, which included as GE 4 an administrative inquiry \ninto a failure by Applicant to secure a Secret GSA container (classified safe) within a \nCOMSEC closed area in March 2017. A December 31, 2018 letter forwarding the \nproposed GEs to Applicant, and a list of the GEs, were marked as hearing exhibits (HEs \nI-II) for the record but not admitted in evidence. Nine Applicant exhibits (AEs A-I) were \nadmitted in evidence without any objections. Applicant, his former supervisor, and his \ncurrent supervisor testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on June \n3, 2019. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \n \nOn the Government\u2019s motion and with no objections from Applicant, the \nallegations of the SOR were amended to read as follows: \n \na. In about August 2017, while employed with [company name and \nlocation omitted], you lost a Secret classified accountable item. \n \nb. In about March 2017, while employed with [company name and location \nomitted] you left a classified container unsecured within a Secret closed \narea. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old married father with two adult children. He has worked \nfor his defense-contractor employer since August 1983. In 2010, he assumed the duties \nof alternate COMSEC custodian for the engineering department at his facility, and he \ntransitioned into the role of lead COMSEC custodian by 2014. Applicant held a Secret \nclearance from November 1993 until June 2010, when it was upgraded to Top Secret. \n\n3 \n \nThat clearance was renewed most recently in April 2015. (GEs 1, 3; AEs E-F, H; Tr. 52-\n54.) He works in a building where all employees are required to possess a minimum of \na DOD Secret clearance (Tr. 39, 55, 67), and he has had security training on an annual \nbasis over the years. (Tr. 55-56.) \n  \n \nApplicant had an unblemished record for any security infractions before he took \non COMSEC custodian duties at the request of his then supervisor. (Tr. 69, 73.) The \nsupervisor considered Applicant the best candidate because of his reputation, his \nadministrative skills, and his integrity. (Tr. 74.) While leaving work one day in late \nAugust 2013, Applicant failed to spin an X-09 lock on the door to a stand-alone \nCOMSEC closed area that housed COMSEC equipment for multiple satellite \ncommunications programs. Then the alternate COMSEC custodian at his facility, he \nwas distracted by other duties as he conducted end-of-the-day security checks. \nApproximately 15 minutes after he left work, an information security systems (ISS) \nemployee discovered that the door to the room was shut, but was not properly secured \nin that the lock had not been spun. A co-worker with appropriate access to the \nCOMSEC area secured the room, and the ISS employee contacted Applicant, who \nreturned to work and visually inspected the area. He determined that there had been no \nattempt at unauthorized access. Applicant and his supervisor reported the incident to \nhis facility security officer (FSO) the next day. The facility\u2019s FSO conducted an \nadministrative inquiry into the incident and determined that no compromise of classified \ninformation had occurred. Under the company\u2019s security procedures, a written report of \nthe violation was issued for the \u201cadministrative\u201d violation. Applicant was reminded of the \nproper procedures for securing closed areas and of the company\u2019s security policy \nproviding for disciplinary action of up to a five-day suspension for any additional \nviolation within a 12-month period. (GEs 2-3, 6; Tr. 47, 56-57, 68.) \n \n \nThe number of programs requiring COMSEC support increased significantly \nstarting in 2014. (Tr. 66.) As lead COMSEC custodian, Applicant had the difficult task of \nworking through a new electronic keying system. He managed 12 classified COMSEC \nsafes secured by X-09 locks and handled all the crypto-security for two separate \nfacilities for his employer while mentoring a new alternate COMSEC custodian. (Tr. 43-\n45.) He worked long hours, including some weekends, to ensure that programs met \ntheir schedules. He presided over government audits with \u201cNo Findings.\u201d (AEs E-F.) \nApplicant\u2019s annual performance evaluation for 2015 shows that he had earned the \nrespect of his supervisor and peers. Applicant\u2019s supervisor indicated that Applicant had \ndone \u201ca great job handling the ever changing requirements for COMSEC.\u201d He gave \nApplicant an overall rating of \u201cexceeds requirements.\u201d (AE E.) \n \n \nApplicant continued to do an \u201coutstanding job\u201d as COMSEC custodian in 2016. In \nevaluating Applicant\u2019s performance for 2016, Applicant\u2019s supervisor remarked that \nApplicant took his job very seriously, worked well with others, and had become their \nexpert \u201con the generation, architect, and maintaining of all COMSEC hardware and \nkeys.\u201d Time and time again, Applicant worked tirelessly to meet the demands of all the \nengineers and their programs. (AE D.) \n \n\n4 \n \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant left a GSA-approved container in the COMSEC room \nunattended and unsecured for about 15 minutes. The safe was approved for storage of \nSecret information and contained classified COMSEC equipment and combinations. It \nwas one of seven containers approved for storage of classified COMSEC material \nlocated within the COMSEC closed area. Access to the COMSEC closed area was \nrestricted to three individuals with the combination and swipe access. The COMSEC \narea was inside another approved DOD Secret closed area where Applicant was \nassisting some engineers. The violation was discovered by a company industrial \nsecurity employee while conducting a security self-inspection. When questioned by his \nFSO about his procedures that morning, Applicant acknowledged that he had departed \nthe COMSEC room to assist some engineers within the larger closed area without \nsecuring the safe \u201cbecause he believed that since the container was located inside an \napproved closed area no action needed to occur.\u201d (GE 4.) Applicant now does not recall \ntelling the FSO that he did not need to secure the safe because he knew the proper \nprocedure to secure the classified container was by spinning the X-09 locks. (Tr. 58-59.) \nHe attributes his security infraction to \u201ca lot going on that day.\u201d (Tr. 68.) The FSO \nconducted an internal administrative inquiry into the incident. She concluded that no \nloss, compromise, or suspected compromise of classified information was presumed \nbecause no unauthorized individuals had been present, and no suspicious activity had \noccurred during the 15 minutes that the safe was unsecured and unattended. Applicant \nwas issued a written warning and required to attend a closed-area security briefing \nwhere he was re-educated on the requirements for safeguarding classified information. \n(GEs 2, 4, 6; Tr. 59-60.) The incident was reported to the DOD CAF by Applicant\u2019s \nemployer. (GE 2.) \n \n \nIn April 2017, Applicant informed his then supervisor that he could no longer \nhandle the stress of being the COMSEC manager, given the volume of COMSEC \nmaterial and having only one other employee, the alternate COMSEC manager, to \nassist him. After an internal audit by a COMSEC specialist from another facility, who \nquestioned why COMSEC responsibilities were being handled by the engineering \ndepartment when accounting for COMSEC was a security function in the company\u2019s \nother facilities, Applicant\u2019s employer decided to transfer COMSEC responsibilities from \nthe engineering department to the security department, and to increase the staff \nhandling COMSEC duties. (Tr. 40-42, 64, 72.) It took the company several months to \nassign a COMSEC manager, and a few more months to hire two more COMSEC \nemployees before Applicant was relieved of his COMSEC responsibilities. (Tr. 83-84.) \n \n \nIn September 2017, Applicant informed his FSO that he could not locate a \nSecret-controlled cryptographic item that was within his accountability. He had recently \nconducted an inventory of approximately 1,300 items of COMSEC material in August \n2017, in preparation for an audit by a U.S. government agency, and was unable to \naccount for an item from a high-volume COMSEC account. During an investigation into \nthe violation by company security personnel, it was discovered that the item had not \nbeen sighted during any of four previous semi-annual inventories that had been signed \noff by Applicant and the alternate COMSEC custodian. Applicant was required to \nphysically touch all pieces of COMSEC hardware during semi-annual inventories. (Tr. \n\n5 \n \n42.) He knew that the Secret cryptographic item had last been seen in February 2015. \n(GEs 2, 5-6; AE C; Tr. 61-62.) However, he continued to believe that the item was \nsomewhere in the COMSEC room because he had a receipt indicating that it had been \nreturned to COMSEC accountability. (GEs 2, 5; Tr. 49.) He was determined to find the \npiece of equipment, which was about one square inch in size and part of a \u201csplit \nencryption key\u201d that requires mating to the second half of the key to load operational \nsoftware. As part of a unique electronic system, it alone is useless in revealing any \nclassified information. (Tr. 50-51.)  He did not want to be the first employee to lose a \nclassified item at his worksite, and so he continued to search for the item without \nsuccess. (Tr. 51.) Applicant was verbally reprimanded by his supervisor, but he was not \notherwise disciplined for the violation. (GE 6, Tr. 63, 92.) In reporting the incident to the \nDOD CAF in late September 2017, Applicant\u2019s employer indicated that Applicant was in \nthe process of being removed as the COMSEC custodian because the COMSEC \norganization was being transitioned to a function of the security department. (GE 2.)   \n \n \nOn October 25, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). In response to an inquiry \nconcerning whether he had received a written warning, or been officially reprimanded or \ndisciplined for misconduct in the workplace, such as a security violation, in the last \nseven years, Applicant indicated that he had been disciplined or warned in May 2017 for \n\u201c1) Security violation (unsecure container) [and] 2) COMSEC account (missing an \naccountable item).\u201d (GE 1.) \n \n \nFollowing the transition of COMSEC custodian responsibilities to the facility\u2019s \nsecurity department in December 2017, Applicant began training to assume a position \nas a logistics planner. In evaluating Applicant\u2019s job performance for 2017, his now \nformer supervisor indicated that the engineering team, program office, and management \nare indebted to Applicant for all the late nights and weekends he spent as COMSEC \ncustodian to ensure the success of programs. (AE C.) The supervisor made no mention \nof the security infractions in Applicant\u2019s performance evaluation. He discussed the \nincidents with Applicant, who realized his mistakes, and the supervisor \u201cknew that it \nwasn\u2019t going to be a systemic problem.\u201d (Tr. 91.) In January 2018, Applicant filled in for \nthe facility\u2019s COMSEC team with no adverse incidents while the team received training \noffsite. (AE B; Tr. 104.) \n \n \nOn February 5, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for \nthe Office of Personnel Management about the two security violations in 2017. He \nattributed his failure to spin the lock on a classified container to being in a hurry. \nConcerning the loss of a Secret accountable item, Applicant admitted that he did not \nimmediately report that an item was missing because he thought it would be \nirresponsible of him to report the loss before he had an opportunity to look for it. He \nexpressed his belief that it was lost during an NSA audit in August 2017 (GE 6), \nalthough he now admits that he knew it was missing for some two years. (Tr. 62.) He \nexplained that it was a small item, approximately the size of a USB plug, and so could \nhave slipped through a crack. Applicant indicated that he did not lose his clearance or \n\n6 \n \nhis access, and he did not receive a written reprimand. Applicant did not recall any other \nsecurity violations. (GE 6.) \n \n \nOn April 25, 2018, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator and \nconfronted with the details of his August 2013 violation regarding his failure to spin the \nX-09 lock at the end of the day. Applicant attributed the security infraction to being in a \nrush and distracted by work demands. Applicant explained that he no longer had \nCOMSEC custodian duties as of February 2018, and he now feels more comfortable \nand less stressed with his current level of responsibility for classified information. (GE \n6.) \n \n \nIn his current position, Applicant no longer has any access to any containers \napproved for classified storage. He no longer works in the COMSEC storage room and \ndoes not have regular access to classified information. (Tr. 69.) His current job function \nrequires that he maintain a Secret clearance. (Tr. 101.) He understands the concern \nabout the failure to timely report the missing COMSEC item and acknowledges that he \nshould have reported it when he first could not find it. (Tr. 108.) \n  \nCharacter references \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor from 1999 through 2017 testified for Applicant and also \nprovided a character reference letter. (AE H.) This supervisor retired from the company \nin August 2018, after 41 years of service for the company. (Tr. 71.) Throughout their \nmore than 30 years as co-workers, Applicant has been a reliable and trustworthy \nemployee. Applicant\u2019s former supervisor attests that Applicant was promoted to \nCOMSEC custodian in 2014 because of his consistent high level of performance as \nalternate COMSEC custodian starting in 2010. While holding COMSEC custodian \nresponsibilities, the company had several audits by their U.S. government customers \nand by internal company security personnel, all with favorable results. Applicant\u2019s \nformer supervisor considers Applicant to be one of the most security conscious people \nhe has known. (AE H.) At Applicant\u2019s hearing the supervisor testified that the COMSEC \nroom was a \u201cvery, very stressful area.\u201d (Tr. 75-76, 86.) Twelve different programs were \n\u201cconstantly under the gun, as far as time constraints and getting the work done to meet \nthe obligations of the contract[s]\u201d (Tr. 76), and the COMSEC area was understaffed. (Tr. \n81.) Regarding the transition of the COMSEC functions to the security department, the \nsupervisor explained that their employer had an internal audit from a COMSEC \nspecialist from another of the company\u2019s facilities, who questioned why engineering was \nin charge of COMSEC responsibilities. (Tr. 80-81.) He added that the company wanted \nApplicant to retain COMSEC duties as part of the security department. Applicant elected \nto move to engineering support. (Tr. 82.) In the supervisor\u2019s experience, Applicant took \nhis accountability and security responsibilities very seriously. (Tr. 87.) The supervisor \nbelieves the violations in 2017 occurred because of Applicant\u2019s \u201ctremendous\u201d workload. \nThe security infractions did not shake his confidence in Applicant\u2019s ability to protect \nclassified information. (Tr. 88-89.) He blames himself for not paying more attention to \nthe work demands placed on Applicant as COMSEC custodian. (Tr. 86.) \n \n\n7 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor has worked for the defense contractor for some 34 \nyears. He transferred to Applicant\u2019s worksite 21 years ago and has known him since \nthat time. He was one of 12 test directors in their secure building. They \u201cheavily taxed\u201d \nApplicant in the COMSEC room to maintain their programs. (Tr. 96-97.) Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent supervisor knows of no one he would trust more with national security \ninformation than Applicant, who has shown him \u201cnothing but respect, tremendous care, \nresponsibility and [met] all of the, you know, proper traits of just a terrific employee.\u201d (Tr. \n99.) Applicant\u2019s current supervisor corroborated the significant increase in COMSEC \nwork between 2014 and 2017, as the company doubled the number of large programs \nfrom 6 to 12 during that time. He considers it responsible of Applicant to have \napproached his then supervisor in 2017 and told him that the job was \u201cjust too stressful.\u201d \n(Tr. 100.) Applicant\u2019s current supervisor is aware of Applicant\u2019s security violations in \n2017. He has confidence in Applicant\u2019s ability to handle classified information. (Tr. 102.) \n \n \nA co-worker, who has known Applicant for some 25 years, respects Applicant for \nthe seriousness and attention to detail he brings to his work. He described Applicant as \na \u201cmodel employee,\u201d who leads by example. (AE G.) \n \n \nAnother co-worker, who interacted with Applicant on a daily basis during \nApplicant\u2019s tenure as chief COMSEC custodian at their test site, knows Applicant as a \ngolf partner outside of work. He has always found Applicant to have strong family values \nand to be \u201ca very upright, honest, and affable person.\u201d (AE I.) \n \n \nIn December 2018, Applicant was recognized by his peers and leadership for his \noutstanding technical contributions in 2018. He was promoted, his official title was \nchanged to include \u201cWith Honors,\u201d and he was given a $1,500 cash award by his \nemployer. (AE A; Tr. 99.) In evaluating Applicant\u2019s annual performance for 2018 in \nMarch 2019, Applicant\u2019s current supervisor described Applicant\u2019s work ethic and \ncommitment to the job as \u201csecond to none.\u201d Applicant was thorough and competent in \ntaking on new roles, and he took complete ownership of his tasks. (AE B.) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. \nIn addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nrequired to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\n\n8 \n \nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to \nobtain a favorable security decision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \n \n \nThe security concern for handling protected information is articulated in AG \u00b6 33: \n \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information\u2014which includes classified and other \nsensitive government information, and proprietary information\u2014raises \ndoubt about an individual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or \nwillingness and ability to safeguard such information, and is a serious \nsecurity concern. \n \n \nThe evidence establishes that Applicant committed three security violations while \nin the demanding jobs of alternate COMSEC custodian and then COMSEC custodian. \nWhen leaving work one day in August 2013, Applicant inadvertently failed to spin an X-\n09 cypher lock on the door to a COMSEC closed area approved for the storage of \nclassified COMSEC information and equipment. Under \u00b6 5-306 of the National Industrial \n\n9 \n \nSecurity Program Operating Manual (NISPOM), DOD 5220.22-M, dated February 2006, \naccess to closed areas approved for classified storage must be controlled to preclude \nunauthorized access. During non-working hours and during working hours when the \narea is unattended, admittance to the area is required to be controlled by locked \nentrances and exits, secured either by an approved built-in combination lock, or an \napproved combination or key-operated padlock. This August 2013 security violation was \nnot alleged in the SOR and so it cannot be considered for disqualifying purposes. In \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five \ncircumstances in which conduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows:  \n  \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines \nis applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for the whole-person analysis \nunder Directive Section 6.3. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s August 2013 security infraction is of little present security concern, \ngiven it was inadvertent, and he acted appropriately when informed about his failure to \nsecure the X-09 lock on the COMSEC closed area. He immediately returned to work \nand made the appropriate checks to ensure that the facility was secured. The next day, \nhe filed a timely report of the August 2013 violation with his FSO. His conduct following \nthe infraction provides evidence of his positive attitude toward his security \nresponsibilities. \n \n \nIn March 2017, Applicant failed to spin an X-09 cypher lock on a safe approved \nfor storage of Secret COMSEC material, after he had been reminded of his obligation to \nproperly secure classified information for the August 2013 incident. Applicant received a \nwritten warning for the violation, and he was re-briefed about his security responsibilities \nin closed areas. His March 2017 security violation (SOR \u00b6 1.b) triggers disqualifying \ncondition AG \u00b6 34(g), \u201cany failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or \nsensitive information.\u201d Under \u00b6 5-308 of the NISPOM, security containers, vaults, \ncabinets, and other authorized storage containers are to be kept locked when not under \nthe direct supervision of an authorized person entrusted with the contents. \n \n \nIn August 2017, while conducting an inventory of COMSEC material in \npreparation for an upcoming audit by the U.S. government, Applicant could not locate a \nsmall piece of COMSEC hardware classified Secret that was within his accountability. \nApplicant violated his responsibility under \u00b6 5-100 of the NISPOM, which requires that \nindividuals are responsible for safeguarding classified information entrusted to them. \nThe classified item had last been seen in February 2015. Paragraph 1-303 of the \nNISPOM states, \u201cClassified material that cannot be located within a reasonable period \nof time shall be presumed to be lost until an investigation determines otherwise.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s loss of a classified item within his accountability (SOR \u00b6 1.a) implicates AG \u00b6 \n34(g) and raises concerns about his security posture under AG \u00b6 34(h), \u201cnegligence or \nlax security practices that persist despite counseling by management.\u201d  \n\n10 \n \n \nDisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 34(i), \u201cfailure to comply with rules or regulations that \nresults in damage to the national security, regardless of whether it was deliberate or \nnegligent,\u201d has not been established. There is no assessment or conclusion in evidence \nfrom the government or from Applicant\u2019s employer about whether compromise occurred \nor cannot be ruled out. Applicant and his former supervisor testified that the missing \nitem is half of a \u201csplit key\u201d that has to be mated and then inserted into a unique \nelectronic system to reveal classified information, so should it be found by an \nunauthorized person, access to classified information would not be easily obtained. \n  \n \nApplicant has the burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by his \nviolations of the rules and regulations for handling protected information. Applicant \nhandled classified information without any problems for some 20 years before he failed \nto spin the lock on the door to the COMSEC closed area in August 2013. His security \nviolations are very infrequent when considering his many years of holding a DOD \nclearance without any security violations or infractions. Yet, it is difficult to fully mitigate \nthe security concerns under AG \u00b6 35(a). The security violations alleged in the SOR did \nnot occur so long ago. Moreover, although it was alleged that Applicant lost a classified \nitem in August 2017, the evidence shows the classified item had not been seen since \nFebruary 2015; that Applicant knew it was missing because he had conducted semi-\nannual inventories since that time; and that he did not report the item as missing to his \nFSO until September 2017. He failed to comply with security requirements over the \ncourse of two years, so it was not an isolated event. AG \u00b6 35(a) provides: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \nReform is established under AG \u00b6 35(b) when \u201cthe individual responded \nfavorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates a positive \nattitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities.\u201d Regarding Applicant\u2019s March \n2017 failure to spin the X-09 lock on one of the seven classified safes in the COMSEC \nroom, Applicant left the container unsecured and unattended for about 15 minutes while \nhe assisted some engineers outside of the COMSEC room but in the larger closed area \naccessed only by authorized personnel with appropriate clearances. He told his FSO \nthat he did not think that he had to secure the security container because it was located \ninside an approved closed area. However, he admitted at his hearing that he knew that \nhe should have properly secured the container and that it was not his practice to leave \nthe safes unlocked. Applicant has accepted full responsibility for the March 2017 \ninfraction alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. \n \n \nRegarding the violation alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s loss of the classified \nCOMSEC item was unintentional, but he did not inform his FSO about the missing item \nuntil September 2017. His employer\u2019s investigation revealed that the item had not been \nsighted during any of four previous semi-annual inventories that had been signed off by \nApplicant as COMSEC custodian and by the alternate COMSEC custodian. About the \n\n11 \n \nsemi-annual inventories, Applicant testified that, as COMSEC custodian, he had to \nphysically touch all pieces of COMSEC equipment and report to the government. As a \nlongtime cleared employee, Applicant can be expected to have known about his \nobligation to timely report the possible loss of a classified item to his FSO under \u00b6 1-300 \nof the NISPOM. His belief that the item would eventually be found cannot justify such a \nlengthy delay in complying with his reporting obligation. Even so, there is some \nevidence of reform in that brought the missing item to the attention of his FSO in \nSeptember 2017, albeit very belatedly. He did not display a cavalier attitude when \nverbally reprimanded for the violation by his then supervisor. Applicant\u2019s former and \ncurrent supervisors and two longtime co-workers attest to the seriousness with which \nApplicant has taken security throughout his career. AG \u00b6 35(b), \u201cthe individual \nresponded favorably to counseling or remedial security training and now demonstrates \na positive attitude toward the discharge of security responsibilities,\u201d has some \napplicability. \n \n \nApplicant testified that he received annual security training throughout his \nemployment. There is no indication that AG \u00b6 35(c), \u201cthe security violations were due to \nimproper or inadequate training or unclear instructions,\u201d applies. AG \u00b6 35(d), \u201cthe \nviolation was inadvertent, it was promptly reported, there is no evidence of compromise, \nand it does not suggest a pattern,\u201d is established with regard to the August 2013 and \nMarch 2017 violations that involve the failure to properly secure the COMSEC room at \nthe end of the work day and leaving unsecured the classified container in the COMSEC \nroom, respectively. Although the March 2017 violation was found during a security self-\ninspection by another employee, and not self-reported, it was inadvertent and there was \nno compromise. Applicant did not set out to lose or misplace the Secret COMSEC item \nwithin his accountability, but AG \u00b6 35(d) cannot reasonably apply in mitigation of the \nsecurity violation in SOR \u00b6 1.a because Applicant knew that the item had been missing \nfor some two years before he reported it missing. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct \nand all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n12 \n \n \nSome of the adjudicative process factors were addressed under Guideline K, but \nsome warrant additional comment. Applicant was motivated to perform his COMSEC \nduties to the best of his ability in a very stressful work environment with only the \nalternate COMSEC custodian to assist him. Applicant was responsible for handling and \nsafeguarding more than 1,000 COMSEC items. It is perhaps not surprising that an item \nabout a square inch in size would \u201cfall between the cracks.\u201d Yet the fact that it was half \nof a split key that would be useless without the other half does not excuse the loss of \nthe classified COMSEC hardware. It certainly does not justify his failure to report for \nsome two years that he could not locate an item within his accountability. When \ndiscussing the incident with the OPM investigator in February 2018, Applicant was less \nthan fully forthcoming about when he first realized the item was missing. He indicated \nthat he noticed the item was missing during an inventory for a change of COMSEC \ncustodian in 2017 and that he looked for the item for three weeks before reporting it \nmissing. Applicant now admits that he knew that the item was missing for some two \nyears. While the loss of the classified item was inadvertent, he raised some doubt about \nwhether he can be counted on to timely and candidly report when his conduct falls short \nof full compliance with his security responsibilities. \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the \nDirective. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is not designed to \npunish applicants for past mistakes or shortcomings. There is considerable evidence \nsupporting continuation of a security clearance for Applicant. Applicant\u2019s then supervisor \nblames himself for not paying more attention to the work demands placed on Applicant \nas COMSEC custodian. He considers Applicant to have been an outstanding COMSEC \ncustodian, even in 2017, despite knowing that Applicant failed to timely report the \nCOMSEC item as missing. He chose not to comment about the presumed loss of the \nCOMSEC item in Applicant\u2019s annual performance evaluation for 2017 because he did \nnot see it as a systemic problem. In his opinion, Applicant displayed a serious attitude \ntoward the discharge of his security responsibilities. It is noteworthy that Applicant\u2019s \nemployer did not remove Applicant from COMSEC duties or impose discipline beyond a \nverbal reprimand from his immediate supervisor for the loss of the COMSEC item. \nApplicant continued to perform COMSEC duties throughout the transition until \nDecember 2017, and he filled in for COMSEC employees when they had training in \nJanuary 2018. Applicant\u2019s current supervisor remains confident in Applicant\u2019s ability to \nappropriately handle classified information. Applicant has continued to be a valuable \ncontributor at work, as evidenced by him being recognized by his peers for his technical \nexcellence and leadership in December 2018. Applicant is now in a less demanding \nposition with respect to the risk of mishandling classified information. He understands \nthat he should have timely notified his employer about the missing COMSEC item. After \nconsidering his overall security posture since 1993, he does not present an \nunacceptable security risk going forward. This does not mean that his security violations \nare condoned, but he has adequately demonstrated that he can be counted on to \ndischarge his security responsibilities in accord with policies and regulations. \n \n \n\n13 \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Berry, Esq.  \n09/20/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \n  \nApplicant\u2019s credible testimony, combined with his favorable character evidence, \nsufficiently dispels the security concerns arising from the guidelines for personal \nconduct, criminal conduct, and misuse of information technology systems. Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 24, 2017, Applicant signed and certified an Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP) application for a security clearance. He provided a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) on March 13, 2018. When the Department of Defense \n(DOD) could not make a preliminary affirmative finding required to grant a security \nclearance, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 24, \n2018, detailing security concerns under the guidelines for personal conduct (Guideline \nE), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and misuse of technology systems (Guideline M). \nThe action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \n\n2 \n \nEligibility for access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs). On June 8, 2017, these guidelines were made applicable to all individuals who \nrequire initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to \nhold a sensitive position.  \n \nApplicant provided his notarized answer to the SOR on September 18, 2018. The \ncase was assigned to me on January 16, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on February 27, 2019, for a hearing on \nMarch 18, 2019. The hearing was held as scheduled. The Government\u2019s five exhibits \n(GE) 1-5 and Applicant\u2019s seven exhibits (AE) A-G were entered into evidence without \nobjection. On March 26, 2019, DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) and the record \nclosed. \n \nProcedural Matters \n \nThe reference to SOR \u201c2.a\u201d at the end of the SOR 1.b allegation (page 2) is \nincorrect. SOR \u201c2.a\u201d is amended by changing the reference to SOR \u201c1.a\u201d where the \nalleged reasons for Applicant\u2019s termination are described in greater detail. This \namendment is authorized under E3.1.17 of DOD Directive 5220.6.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 1.a concerning his termination \nfrom his employment after he allegedly stole a company laptop. Although he was \nterminated from his job on June 6, 2017, he did not steal the laptop at issue. He was \nauthorized to carry in and take laptops (and other equipment) out of the special \ncompartmented information facility (SCIF) and into the storage area. He was not aware \nof a change in corporate policy disallowing his access to the storage area. He denied \nSOR 1.b in part because he knew he was terminated for violating corporate policy, but \ndid not know the specific reasons why. Applicant\u2019s denial of SOR 1.c is based on his \nbelief he provided truthful information to the OPM investigator in the March 2018 PSI, \nalthough he was still unaware of the specific reasons for his termination. Applicant \ndenied SOR 2.a because he did not commit a criminal offense when he used the laptop. \nHe never attempted to steal the laptop. He denied that he failed to comply with rules \napplying to information technology systems as alleged under SOR 3.a. He followed \npolicy and protocols in regularly handling laptops in the SCIF. If he had known about the \nnew restrictive policies, he would have complied with them. (September 2018 answer to \nSOR) \n \nAppellant is 58 years old. He has been married to his second wife since 1986 \nand has two adult-aged children. Applicant served in the United States Navy (USN) \nfrom 1978 until his honorable discharge in 1998. In 2005 and 2006, he took some \ncourses online. Since December 2017, he has been working for a defense contractor as \nan information systems security manager. Before his current job, he worked for six \nmonths with another contractor, but left his position due to a reduction in job benefits. \nBetween April 2013 and his termination in June 2017 (SOR 1.a), he was employed as a \n\n3 \n \ncorporate information security manager by a defense contractor. From 2005 to April \n2013, Applicant was an information security manager for another contractor; his \nsupervisor during this period was the vice president of government security who \nterminated Applicant in June 2017. Applicant is certified as an information system \nsecurity professional. He has held a security clearance since 1978. (GE 1 at 8-40; Tr. \n14-17; AE E; AE F) \n \nSOR 1.a \u2013 Applicant was terminated by his employer on June 6, 2017 for alleged \ntheft of a company laptop. In the June 2017 termination letter, the vice president of \ngovernment security indicated that Applicant\u2019s conduct resulted in a series of security \nviolations as outlined in the company\u2019s \u201cMaster System Security Plan.\u201d The vice \npresident and others saw Applicant in a video on January 25, 2017 removing an \nunclassified laptop from the storage area. The vice president determined that: (1) \nApplicant had violated company policy and government security regulations; and (2) \nApplicant performed a willful action inconsistent with his job duties and classification. \nThe second allegation appears to be a restatement of the first allegation using different \nwords, with the addition of the word \u201cwillful.\u201d Applicant never saw the final investigation \nreport (June 6, 2017); he saw the termination letter (June 6, 2017) for the first time two \nweeks before the hearing. He did not dispute the termination because he violated the \npolicy prohibiting his access to the storage areas. However, Applicant was unaware of \nthe change in policy. (GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 1; Tr. 23-24, 54-57) \n \nApplicant did not steal the laptop. In preparation for a security inspection on \nJanuary 25, 2017, he was asked to ensure the secure communication equipment in the \nSCIF was working properly. To check the system, he reviewed the instructions for the \nsecure telephone equipment (STE) which indicated that the phone software should be \ntested and updated as required. In order to check the software, the phone had to be \nconnected to a laptop and the system checked as necessary. (GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. 24) \n \nApplicant determined that he needed a laptop from the storage area. Based on a \nspecific addendum for a classified customer (which Applicant previously received at an \nidentified date), he had authority to transfer unclassified equipment in and out of SCIF \nso that he could perform project-related tasks. He disabled some of the functions and \nturned off the hard drive controller of the laptop. This may have been why, during the \nsubsequent investigation, management thought the hard drive was wiped clean after \nthey experienced a difficult time booting the system and getting the encryption module \nof the laptop to engage. (Tr. 26-28, 32)  \n \nOn January 25, 2017, Applicant opened up the storage area (identified as the \n\u201cstorage closet\u201d and \u201cIT Storage area\u201d in the government exhibits) with a key he been \nprovided by the previous facility security officer (FSO) when he was hired in 2013. \nApplicant carried the laptop and cables from the storage area to the SCIF and started \nthe STE check where he determined that the STE setting was incorrect. After adjusting \nthe setting, the STE phone system began working properly. Applicant provided this \nexplanation of how he used the laptop to solve the STE phone problem to corporate \n\n4 \n \ncounsel in March 2017 and to the vice present of government security in April 2017. \n(GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 1; Tr. 33, 34, 36, 65) \n \nAfter successfully completing the STE test (January 25, 2017), Applicant learned \nthat the security inspection was still in progress, so he placed the laptop, the cables, \nand some other equipment in a box outside the SCIF, in a specific area which was not \nin the unsecured area where other equipment was checked to determine its \nclassification. Because the security inspection was still ongoing, Applicant did not have \ntime to clear the laptop and return it to the storage area as required by standard \nprocedure. Unfortunately, he forgot about the laptop for about a month and a half. (GE 2 \nat 3; Tr. 30) \n \nOn March 9, 2017, corporate counsel and other members of management had a \nmeeting with Applicant about the missing laptop. The counsel presented Applicant with \na video dated January 25, 2017, showing him removing a laptop from the storage area. \nApplicant did not recall taking the laptop. Counsel asked Applicant to ruminate about the \nlaptop\u2019s whereabouts, then call the counsel and return it to the director of special \nprograms. Management also interrogated Applicant on how he got the keys for the \nstorage area, but about a week later, dropped that part of the investigation when it was \ndetermined Applicant had authority to possess the keys. (GE 2 at 2-3; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 30-\n35, 59-61) \n \nOn approximately March 11, 2017, the security officer at another facility of \nApplicant\u2019s company was having a problem with the STE system, and asked Applicant \nfor assistance. When the security officer mentioned the STE issue, Applicant \nremembered the location of the missing laptop. He retrieved the laptop from the box \noutside the SCIF, and made sure it had not been restarted or \u201cbooted up.\u201d After shutting \nit down, he called corporate counsel and turned it over to the director of special \nprograms as requested. Applicant learned at a meeting in April 2017 that, unbeknownst \nto him, there had been a change in corporate policy in 2016 that only government \nsecurity solutions personnel were allowed access to the storage area. The policy \nchange meant he was no longer permitted access into the storage area. (GE 2 at 2-3; \nGE 3 at 2; Tr. 28, 30-35, 47, 59-61, 64) \n \nSOR 1.b \u2013 In response to Section 13-A Employment Activities, of his August \n2017 e-QIP, Applicant stated that his reason for leaving his employment in June 2017 \nwas \u201cterminated employment.\u201d In the next block of the section, Applicant answered \naffirmatively that the employment action occurred in the last 7 years. In the next block \nrequiring a summary of the reasons for leaving the employment, Applicant indicated he \nwas \u201cfired.\u201d In response to the reason for being fired, Applicant indicated \u201cfailure to \nfollow corporate policy.\u201d He indicated in his answer to the SOR that when he submitted \nthe August 2017 e-QIP, the only reason he knew for his June 2017 termination was a \nviolation of corporate policy. In response to the question of why he did not reveal the \nincident in his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he did not view the event as security-related \nbecause he never received a written reprimand. He discovered from his subsequent \nemployer (June 2017 to December 2017) that there was an entry in the DOD\u2019s Joint \n\n5 \n \nPersonnel Adjudication System (JPAS) for a security incident that he knew nothing \nabout, but was the reason he was required to resubmit an e-QIP. (GE 3; September \n2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 43-45, 62-63) \n \nSOR 1.c \u2013 As noted earlier in the factual findings, when Applicant provided the \nMarch 2018 PSI, he only knew that he was terminated June 2017 for violating company \npolicy. In the March 2018 PSI, he provided details about why he used the laptop and \nhow he retrieved it after remembering where he put the device outside the SCIF. \nApplicant provided details of the security policies authorizing his access to the SCIF and \nrestoring the STE. When asked about employment issues at his former employer, he \nprovided wide-ranging detail about the laptop investigation between January and June \n2017. He also supplied information about the policy change disallowing his access to \nthe storage room. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3; September 2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 45-47) \n \nApplicant explained that the vice president of government security wanted to \nbuild a large SCIF that would allow different customers (agencies) to use the SCIF area \nat the same time, but at different classification levels. Applicant told the vice president \nthat customers would not approve the configuration. As Applicant predicted, when the \nSCIF was completed, other customers declined to use it because they did not approve \nof the configuration. They also cited a potential lack of control over a specific area within \nthe SCIF. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3; September 2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 38-40) \n \nApplicant believes that primary reason he was terminated was that the vice \npresident of government security made him a \u201cscapegoat\u201d after the company spent a \nlarge sum of money to build the SCIF, then could not get the secured area certified. (GE \n2 at 2-4; GE 3; September 2018 answer to SOR; Tr. 45-47) \n \nApplicant denied that he stole the laptop (SOR 2.a). In late January 2017, during \nan investigation by management to locate the missing laptop, an audit of the classified \nsystems was conducted and no unusual activity by Applicant was found on the \nclassified systems. Review of building access control logs did not reveal any unusual \nbuilding activity. Neither SCIF policies nor customer data was compromised. When \nApplicant recalled where he had left the laptop, he turned it over to the director of \nspecial programs. Thus, Applicant placed the laptop in the box, intending to return it to \nthe storage area. He forgot about it, but he did not steal the laptop. (GE 3 at 1-3) \n \nApplicant maintains that he did not misuse technology systems as alleged under \nSOR 3.a. Rather, he followed all policies and rules and was authorized by the previous \nsecurity officer to transfer the laptop from the storage area to fix the SCIF system \nbecause that was his job. (Tr. 46-47) \n \nApplicant\u2019s only other security violation occurred in 2013 with the same employer \nwho terminated him in June 2017. In the 2013 incident, he was assigned to audit \nclassified laptops that were stored in a safe within a restricted area. He removed the \nlaptops from the safe and began auditing them individually according to procedure. \nThen, he thought he had placed all the laptops back in the safe, but inadvertently left \n\n6 \n \none laptop unattended in a chair. Later the same day, another employee discovered the \nunattended laptop and reported it. A two-person audit team determined that no \nclassified information was compromised and the laptop was returned to the safe. \nApplicant received a written reprimand and was required to review the security policies \nand procedures to prevent a recurrence. (GE 2 at 4)   \n \nCharacter Evidence  \n \n \nApplicant testified that before he was terminated in June 2017, his performance \nwas very good. He received bonuses and in an unidentified year, he was selected as \nsecurity person of the year.  \n \n \nAttached to Applicant\u2019s September 2018 answer is a character endorsement \nfrom the security services team lead indicating that Applicant began working on a \nproject with a federal agency in December 2017. Since that date, Applicant has made \nsignificant contributions to the quality of security reviews. His contributions have helped \nreduce the time necessary to complete the reviews. With his intelligence and \nexperience, the team lead recommends Applicant for a security clearance. (AE A, \nattachment) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s friend indicated by letter dated September 27, 2018, that he has \nknown Applicant on a social basis since 2012. In that time, he has learned that \nApplicant pays a high degree of attention to detail and accuracy. He has impressive \ncomputer skills. The friend, who is retired from a federal agency, considers Applicant \nhonest and reliable. (AE D) \n \nApplicant called two witnesses to testify about his character. Both had previously \nprovided letters of support, with one letter is dated in October 2018. Witness B testified \nthat he is retired from a DOD agency. He has held a security clearance since the 1970s. \nHe worked with Applicant for a contractor from 1999 to 2005, when Applicant left to \nwork for another contractor. They have become friends over the years. Witness B \nconsidered Applicant as honest, trustworthy, and a good family man. Applicant\u2019s \ncomputer knowledge has been beneficial for Witness B\u2019s children. (AE B; Tr. 74-79) \n \n \nWitness C currently works for a defense contractor. He has known Applicant for \nabout 33 years since they were in the USN. Even after Applicant told Witness C about \nthe events leading to his job termination in 2017, Witness C still recommends Applicant \nfor a security clearance. (AE C; Tr. 69-73) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\n7 \n \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \n \nAnalysis \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG & 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. The following will normally result in an unfavorable \nnational security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation or further processing for national security eligibility.  \n \n \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. \n\n8 \n \n \n \nOn June 6, 2017, Applicant was terminated for alleged theft of a company laptop \n(SOR 1.a). On January 25, 2017, he was captured on video removing a laptop from a \nstorage area. Throughout the security investigation, Applicant denied stealing the \nlaptop. Throughout the security investigation, he denied violating company policy. \nRather, he had a good-faith belief that he was authorized at all times to carry laptops in \nan out of the SCIF. Applicant was completely forthright with corporate counsel in March \n2017 about why he retrieved and used the laptop. (GE 3 at 2) In April 2017, Applicant \nexplained to the vice president of government security that he was authorized to carry \nlaptops in and out of the SCIF. He had not been informed of the policy change \nrestricting access to the storage area to only certain employees. Had he known about \nthe change in corporate policy, he would have complied with those changes. I find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations during the security investigation and at the hearing credible. \nBecause I do not find AG \u00b6 16(c) applies, mitigation is not necessary. \n \n \nSOR 1.b and 1.c will be addressed together since they allege deliberate \nfalsifications by Applicant in his August 2017 e-QIP and March 2018 PSI. I am \nconvinced that the only information that Applicant knew about that caused his June \n2017 employment termination was a violation of company policy. That is information he \nprovided on the August 2017 e-QIP. I find his explanation credible. AG \u00b6 16(a) does not \napply. \n \nConcerning SOR 1.c, Applicant offered a \u201cscapegoat\u201d explanation for why he \nthought he was terminated. However, this explanation precedes an extensively detailed \naccount of employment issues, including policies, with his former employer between \n2013 and June 2017. Given Applicant\u2019s credible account of the employment events in \nhis March 2018 PSI, confirmed in his answer to the September 2018 SOR, and at the \nhearing, I find that he did not deliberately falsify his March 2018 PSI. AG \u00b6 16(b) does \nnot apply and a discussion of mitigating conditions is not necessary.   \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set forth in AG & 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe potential disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 31 is: \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was charged, prosecuted or convicted.  \n \n \nFirst, AG \u00b6 31(b) requires at least evidence of a credible allegation. The \nGovernment has not presented a credible allegation that Applicant stole the laptop. See \n\n9 \n \nGE 3. The only admission that Applicant has repeatedly made throughout the course of \nthe security investigation and at the hearing has been that he did not steal the laptop. \nThe fact that he was seen on video with the laptop supports Applicant\u2019s position that he \nhad authority to enter the SCIF to fix the STE system. He used the laptop, but forgot to \nreturn it to the storage area. When he remembered where he put the laptop he \nimmediately contacted corporate counsel and transferred the laptop to the director of \nprograms as requested. Thus, Applicant temporarily placed the laptop at a temporary \nlocation with intention of returning the device to the storage area. He forgot about it, but \nhe did not steal it. I find that Applicant\u2019s explanation regarding the laptop is credible. AG \n\u00b6 31(b) has not been established and a discussion of the mitigating conditions is not \nrequired.  \n \nMisuse of Technology Systems \n \n \n The security concern under AG \u00b6 39 is  \n \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \n \n \nConditions that may be disqualifying under AG \u00b6 40 include: \n \n(b) unauthorized modification, destruction, or manipulation of, or denial of \naccess to, an information technology system or any data in such a system; \n \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized.  \n \n \n \nAs corporate information security manager, Applicant violated his employer\u2019s \npolicy (change in policy occurred in 2016) restricting access of the storage areas to \ncertain personnel. His unauthorized manipulation of the employer\u2019s technology system \nby retrieving the laptop from the storage closet, making certain adjustments to the \nlaptop, then transporting the laptop to the SCIF to fix the STE system, falls within the \nscope of AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(b), 40(e), and 40(f).  \n \nConditions that may be mitigating under AG \u00b6 41 are:  \n\n10 \n \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done solely in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness; \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification to \nappropriate personnel; and \n \n(d) the misuse was due to improper or inadequate training or unclear \ninstructions. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred approximately two years ago. The misconduct did \nnot occur under unusual circumstances because Applicant was at work. As the \ncorporate information security manager, Applicant had a good-faith belief that he was \nauthorized to enter and exit the storage area and SCIF with equipment to carry out his \njob responsibilities. Given Applicant\u2019s character evidence, specifically the positive \nevidence from his current team lead praising his work performance, AG \u00b6 41(a) applies.  \n \n \nThe circumstances of this case do not fall exactly within AG \u00b6\u00b6 41(b), 41(c) and \n41(d). However, three mitigating conditions apply in part. While Applicant\u2019s employer \nviewed the entire incident as major, the circumstances show that the violation of \ncorporate policy was minor. See the first clause of AG \u00b6 41(b). When he remembered \nwhere he had placed the laptop, he retrieved it and turned over to management as \nrequested to correct the situation. AG \u00b6 41(c) applies in part. Applicant\u2019s unauthorized \nentry into the SCIF to adjust the STE system occurred because he had not been \ninformed of the policy change that occurred less than a year earlier. See second clause \nof AG \u00b6 41(d). The government exhibits show that the employer\u2019s technology system \nwas not damaged in any manner. Applicant was cooperative throughout his employer\u2019s \ninvestigation and the government\u2019s investigation.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nI have examined the evidence under the personal conduct, criminal conduct, and \ninformation technology guidelines with the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n11 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI have weighed the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nsurrounding circumstances of this case. I have evaluated these conditions with the nine \nfactors of the whole person concept. I have considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character \nreferences that date to his 20-year career in the USN. The one-time policy violation in \nJanuary 2017 was unfortunate. In Applicant\u2019s 40-year history of holding a security \nclearance, his only security-related incident occurred in 2013, when he left a laptop \nunattended. He was reprimanded and required to attend a remedial briefing regarding \npolicies to prevent a recurrence. Considering the evidence from an overall \ncommonsense point of view, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by the \nguidelines for personal conduct, criminal conduct, and misuse of technology systems.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1 (Guideline E):  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J):  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 3 (Guideline M): \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted.  \n \n \n____________ \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Crowley, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse, and \npersonal conduct security concerns, related to his use of marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance, and his failure to disclose it on his security clearance application. \nBased on the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nHistory of Case \nOn October 20, 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). \nOn August 31, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse) and Guideline E (Personal \nConduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG) effective within the DoD after on June 8, 2017. \n03/26/2019\n\n \n \n \n \n2\n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR in writing on September 19, 2018, and \nelected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On November \n19, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material \n(FORM), containing five Items. Applicant received the FORM on November 26, 2018. He \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. Applicant did not provide \na response to the FORM, object to the Government\u2019s evidence, or submit documents. \nHence, all Items are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on February \n7, 2019.  \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old and graduated from high school in May 2008. According \nto his SCA, he worked for Federal contractors from May 2008 to June 2017, and then \nstarted a position in private industry.1 (Items 2, 3) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana in late April 2017, and denied that he \nheld a security clearance at the time, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. According to his \ninvestigation and adjudication history, he was granted a security clearance in August \n2008 and held it through at least January 2018. (Item 5) During an April 2018 interview \nwith a government investigator, Applicant said that he tried marijuana, one time, while at \na party. He said he had not smoked it since then and would not again. (Items 2, 4) \n \n \nApplicant admitted that on May 23, 2017, he tested positive for marijuana while \nemployed by a defense contractor (employer), as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Item 1)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he failed to disclose in his October 2017 SCA that he left \nhis employer in May 2017, subsequent to testing positive for marijuana, and he denied \nthat he left as the result of that incident, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In his Answer, he said \nthat he left for a different reason, (seemingly to start another position with a private \ncompany. 2) During an April 2018 interview with a government investigator, Applicant said \nhe did not disclose information about his marijuana use because he forgot about it. He \nstated that after the May 23, 2017 test, his employer told him he would be suspended for \na week or two, but Applicant left before that occurred, as he claimed he had previously \nintended to do. He did not disclose on his SCA that his employer told him he was to be \nsuspended for one to two weeks for the incident. (Items 2, 4)  \n \n \nApplicant admitted that he failed to disclose in his October 2017 SCA that he used \nmarijuana in April 2017, and tested positive in May 2017 while employed, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. He denied that he held a security clearance at the time or was terminated as \na result of using marijuana. He stated that he left, as previously planned, to assume \nanother job. (Items 2, 4) \n                                            \n1 Applicant has held a Secret or a Top Secret clearance with access to Sensitive Compartment \nInformation (SCI) from August 2008 to at least January 2018. (Item 5) \n2 This is based on Applicant\u2019s work history recorded in his SCA. (Item 3) \n\n \n \n \n \n3\n \nApplicant admitted that, during the April 2018 interview, he told the investigator \nthat he left his employment prior to being suspended for using marijuana, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. However, he asserted that he did not leave because of his drug abuse or \npending suspension. (Item 2) In Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.d, which reiterated the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, he again stated: \u201cI admit, but did not leave for this reason,\u201d meaning \nas a result of testing positive for marijuana. (Item 2.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture.  \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information.  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the concerns related to the illegal use of controlled \nsubstances, to include the misuse of prescription and non-prescription \ndrugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental \nimpairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose \ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both \nbecause such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment \nand because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \n\"controlled substance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is \nthe generic term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \n \n \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position. \n \n \nIn April 2017, Applicant used marijuana, and in May 2017, he tested positive for \nmarijuana. He was working for a Federal contractor at that time and held a security \nclearance. The evidence established the above disqualifying conditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under this \nguideline. Three may potentially apply: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \n \nApplicant did not present evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above \nthree conditions. The behavior happened about two years ago, and there is insufficient \nevidence to conclude it happened under unusual circumstances, such that it does not \ncast doubt on his current trustworthiness. He provided no evidence corroborating his \nassertion that he used marijuana only once, before testing positive on a urinalysis \nconducted after he later claimed his single use occurred. He made no mention of receiving \ntreatment for substance abuse.  \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains the security concerns relating to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information.  \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \nApplicant did not disclose to the Government his marijuana use or that his previous \nemployer intended to suspend him after he tested positive for marijuana in May 2017. \nApplicant asserted that he left that employer before he served a two-week suspension \nbecause he had found another position that he had intended to start before the \nsuspension was imposed. He held a security clearance at the time of the incident. His \n\n \n \n \n \n6\nstatement that he did not disclose his marijuana use because he had forgotten about the \nMay 2017 marijuana incident when he completed his October 2017 SCA is not credible, \nespecially in light of his contemporaneous employment disruption. The evidence \nestablishes the above disqualifying condition, and indicates that he intentionally \nconcealed requested relevant information concerning his recent drug abuse. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns and include: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \nApplicant presented insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the \nabove conditions. He failed to be candid and forthright when he completed his October \n2017 SCA. He did not disclose his marijuana use until confronted by the investigator a \nyear later. He knew his employer intended to suspend him as a result of the positive test \nin May 2017, regardless of the fact he chose to take another position instead of accepting \nthis punishment. It is not reasonable to believe that four months later he could not recall \nthis information that was required to be disclosed on his October 2017 SCA.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in this whole-person analysis.  \n \nApplicant is a young man who has held a security clearance for about ten years, \nduring which time he worked for Federal contractors. His use of marijuana and attempt to \nconceal it on his SCA support independent but equally serious security concerns. He \nfailed to demonstrate rehabilitation or significant behavioral changes. Overall, the \nevidence raises doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n   Paragraph 1, Guideline H: \n          AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n                           Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n            Against Applicant \n \n \n \n   Paragraph 2, Guideline E: \n          AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n   Subparagraphs 2.a through 2.d:          Against Applicant \n     \n                                    Conclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 6, 2018, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2019. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 23, 2019, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on February 7, 2019. The Government offered seven exhibits, referred to \nas Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. The \nApplicant offered six exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F, which \n\n \n2 \n \nwere admitted without objection.  Applicant called one witness and testified on her own \nbehalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 4, 2019. \n \n  \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 54 years old and divorced a second time.  She has a high school \ndiploma.  She holds the positon of Security Specialist 1 for a defense contractor.  She \nseeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense \nindustry.  \n \nParagraph 1 Guideline F \u2013 Financial Considerations   The Government alleges that the \nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk \nof having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant failed to pay Federal income taxes for tax years \n2010; 2014; 2015; and 2017.  It also alleges that she is indebted to three creditors in the \namounts of $501; $170; and $125, respectively.  In her Answer, Applicant admits \nallegation 1.a., and denies the remaining allegations.  Credit reports of the Applicant \ndated May 9, 2015; January 27, 2016; and December 13, 2017, reflect that each of \nthese debts were at one time owing and delinquent.  (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)  \n \n \n \nApplicant has been married and divorced twice to the same man.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit B.)  Her first marriage was from 1985 to 2000.  Her second marriage was from \n2006 to 2011.  Applicant has two children from the marriage who are now adults.  For \nthe most part, Applicant has raised her children and provided for them financially by \nherself.     \n \n \n \nApplicant began working in the defense industry in 2005 for a previous employer.  \nHer employment was not stable or sufficient to live on.  She began working for her \ncurrent employer in 2017 and applied for a security clearance at that time.  Since 2017, \nshe has been working full time, and earning enough money to pay her bills, living within \nher means, and successfully controlling her finances. \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that she has always filed her income tax returns on time.  She \nwas unable to pay her taxes on time beginning in 2010 because she was unemployed.  \nShe continued to be unemployed most of 2011.  Her divorces also caused financial \ndifficulties.  In November 2011, she was hired by an employer but was laid off in 2014 \ndue to corporate downsizing.  Applicant even moved out of state to find a job and was \nhired in March 2015, but the job only lasted for 30 days.  She was hired by another \ncompany in May 2015 where she worked until 2017.   \n \n \nIn 2017, Applicant began working for her current employer and has been earning \nsufficient monies to live on and pay her past-due bills.  In 2017, she contacted and hired \na tax agency to assist her in resolving her back taxes owed.  The agency helped \nApplicant enter into a settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to \nresolve her Federal back taxes owed in the amount of $16,000.  Since February 28, \n\n \n3 \n \n2018, Applicant has been making regular monthly payments to the IRS in the amount of \n$100.  (Tr. p. 43 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  She recently asked the IRS to raise her \nmonthly payment from $100 monthly to $171 monthly because she could afford it and \nbecause she wants to get the debt resolved as soon as possible.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, \nand Tr. p. 51.) \n   \n \n1.b.  During her interview with the DoD investigator, Applicant learned that she \nwas also indebted to a bank for a delinquent credit card in the amount of approximately \n$501.  She promptly paid the debt off in November 2018, even before she received the \nSOR in this matter.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C, and Tr. p. 44.)   \n \n \n1.c.  Applicant was indebted to a gas company in the amount of approximately \n$170.  Applicant stated that she first learned about this debt when she received her \ncredit report from the Government.  She contacted the creditor and they had no record \nof this debt.  Applicant\u2019s account with this creditor is in good standing.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit D.) \n \n \n1.d.  Applicant was also indebted for a medical bill in the amount of \napproximately $125.  She was not aware of the debt until the investigation in this matter.  \nThe debt has been resolved.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \n \n \nApplicant testified that her past has been a rough road, but things have greatly \nimproved.  She now has a better job, earning $3,000 monthly, and her employment is \nstable. Her salary has significantly increased from the past employment she has had.  \nShe enjoys her job and she now has no delinquent debts.  Applicant also has a \nretirement plan with her current employer.  (Tr. p. 53.)   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law, who has known the Applicant for the past forty years, \nand who has military and defense industry experience, and who has held a security \nclearance in the past, testified that Applicant is a very responsible individual.  He has \nwatched her through life struggles and finds her to be exceptionally trustworthy and \nreliable, no matter what she is confronted with.  She lives within her means and pays \nher bills.  She is recommended for a security clearance.  (Tr. pp. 56-62.) \n \n \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor and other \nfriends and colleagues attest to her dependable nature, her punctuality, her hard work \nand dedication as well as her integrity.  She has enriched the team with her abilities and \nwork experience.  She is honest and loyal and can always be counted on to do the right \nthing.  She is recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F.)    \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \n\n \n4 \n \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concern under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \n \n \nApplicant was unable to pay her all of her bills, including her taxes, and became \ndelinquently indebted. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n  \nBeginning in 2010, Applicant\u2019s financial situation began to decline.  She was \ndivorced and unemployed and trying to raise two children on her own.  In this situation, \nshe was unable to pay her taxes and a few bills.  Since getting back to full-time \nemployment in 2017, her finances have been vastly improved.  She has hired a tax \nresolution agency who has helped her enter into a settlement agreement with the IRS \nthat she following.  She has also resolved her other delinquent debts, which were rather \nsmall in the first place.  She has always filed all of the state and Federal income tax \nreturns over the years, so that is not an issue.  She has acted reasonably and \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  She is now earning enough money to live on and \nis paying her bills and living within her means.  Applicant is now on the correct financial \npath.  There are clear indications that the problem is resolved and under control, and \nthere has been a good faith effort to resolve her debts. The Financial Considerations \nconcern has been mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  Applicant has \ndemonstrated responsibility and good judgment even in the face of many life struggles.  \n\n \n7 \n \nShe is well respected on the job, and shows the level of maturity required in order to \nhave access to classified information.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n   Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  National security eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Taroian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines B (Foreign Influence) \nand F (Financial Considerations). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on July 18, 2017. On \nAugust 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines B and F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 23, 2018, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nwritten case on December 12, 2018, and a complete copy of the file of relevant material \n03/20/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n(FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was given an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. He received the \nFORM on January 22, 2019, and submitted a response, which is included in the record \nas Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A. The case was assigned to me on March 12, 2019.  \n \nThe FORM included summaries of personal subject interviews (PSI) conducted on \nAugust 29, 2017, and September 28, 2017. (FORM Item 7.) The summaries were not \nauthenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Department Counsel informed Applicant \nthat he was entitled to comment on the accuracy of the summaries; make any corrections, \nadditions, deletions or updates; or object to consideration of them on the ground that they \nwere not authenticated. Applicant submitted a response to the FORM but did not \ncomment on the accuracy or completeness of the PSI summaries, nor did he object to \nthem. I conclude that he waived any objections to the PSI summaries. Although pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) (holding \nthat it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection had \nbeen waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to object). \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions \nare incorporated in my findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor since June \n2017. He worked as a linguist for other defense contractors from July 2003 to July 2011. \nHe received a security clearance in November 2004. \n \n \n Applicant was born in Lebanon. He enrolled in the Lebanese Army Military \nAcademy in 1980 but resigned in 1981 when its pilot training program was discontinued. \nHe came to the United States in November 1982 on a student visa. He graduated from a \nU.S. university in June 1984 and returned to Lebanon.2 He married a U.S. citizen in \nNovember 1985 and came to the United States on a marriage visa in September 1988. \nHe divorced in November 1988 but remained in the United States and became a U.S. \ncitizen in November 1991.  \n \nApplicant returned to Lebanon in September 2003 and married a citizen and \nresident of Lebanon. He returned to the United States in April 2009. He divorced his \nsecond wife in November 2015. He has two children from his second marriage, ages 13 \nand 10, for whom he pays child support of $530 per month. He calls his children about \n                                                          \n1 Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his security clearance application (FORM Item 3) unless \notherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. \n \n2 Applicant listed a law degree in his SCA, based on a degree from an unaccredited on-line law school. \n\n \n3 \n \nthree times a week to check on their well-being and school progress. (FORM Item 7 at \n6.) His children are U.S. citizens and live with their mother, who is a lawyer in Lebanon.  \n \nApplicant returned to Lebanon in June 2011 to care for his ailing mother, a citizen \nand resident of Lebanon. He was unemployed while in Lebanon. He returned to the United \nStates in December 2016 and was unemployed until February 2017. His mother passed \naway in August 2018. His father passed away before he submitted his SCA. \n \nApplicant has two sisters, ages 55 and 51, who are citizens and residents of \nLebanon. His sisters are married. The older sister owns a shoe store. The younger sister \nis a housewife who is not employed outside the home. (FORM Item 7 at 6.) The \noccupations of their husbands are not reflected in the record. During Applicant\u2019s \nunemployment, he borrowed about $50,000 from his older sister for living expenses. \nWhen his mother was alive, he talked to his sisters weekly because they cared for his \nmother. The record does not reflect the frequency of his contact with his sisters now that \nhis mother has passed away. \n \n. \nAt the request of Department Counsel, I have taken administrative notice that \nLebanon is a parliamentary republic. It apportions governmental authority among a \nMaronite Christian president, a Shia speaker of the parliaments, and a Sunni prime \nminister. A president was elected in October 2016. Parliamentary elections in 2009 were \nconsidered by observers to be peaceful, fair, and free from regional influences, but \nsubsequent elections have been postponed repeatedly since 2013.  \n \nI have taken notice that the U.S. Department of State discourages U.S. nationals \nfrom traveling to Lebanon due to crime, terrorism, and armed conflict. Kidnapping for \nransom, political motives or as a result of family disputes is a serious problem. Several \nterrorist groups operate in Lebanon and control areas in the Bekaa Valley, southern \nLebanon, and south Beirut. Palestinian refugee camps remain outside the jurisdiction of \nlocal security forces and pose a security threat due to potential militant recruitment and \nterrorist infiltration. \n \nI have also taken administrative notice of significant human rights issues in \nLebanon, including arbitrary or unlawful killings by government forces and non-state \nactors and torture by security forces. I have taken notice of the Lebanese government\u2019s \nviolation of citizens\u2019 privacy rights; restrictions of freedom of speech, press, and \nassembly; lack of governmental action to investigate abuse of refugees; and limits on \npolitical participation through repeatedly postponed elections and official corruption. \n \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from July 2017 \n(FORM Item 4) and June 2018 (FORM Item 5), a personal debt disclosed during the \nbackground investigation (FORM Item 4), and a federal income tax debt disclosed in \nApplicant\u2019s SCA (FORM Item 3) and in his answer to the SOR (FORM Item 4). The \nevidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b: credit-card accounts charged off in May 2013 and June \n2017 and placed for collection of $7,976 and $5,278. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nhe attributed these debts to overspending by his second ex-wife. He stated that he has a \nlawyer who is was negotiating with the creditors. He submitted no documentary evidence \nof negotiations, payment agreements, payments, or other resolution of these debts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: cellphone bill placed for collection of $57 in July 2017. In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he attributed this debt to miscommunication with the \nprovider during an overseas deployment. He stated that the issue is resolved and he \ncontinues to receive service from the same provider. He provided no documentary \nevidence of the status of this debt. \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: debts totaling $50,000 to sister, accumulated between 2011 and \n2016. Applicant\u2019s sister has not imposed a due date for repayment. Applicant asserts that \nhe will eventually repay it. (FORM Item 6 at 3.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e: federal income tax debt for $39,000. When Applicant submitted his \nSCA, he disclosed that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for \n2012 or pay the taxes due, that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax \nreturns for 2014, and that he failed to file his return or pay the federal income taxes due \nfor 2015. He estimated that he owed $15,000 for 2012, nothing for 2014, and $12,000 for \n2015. In his answer to the SOR, he submitted documentation that he had a payment \nagreement with the IRS in 2012 for monthly $250 payments, but he submitted no evidence \nthat he had made any payments. He attached tax notices to his answer, reflecting that he \nowed federal income taxes of $645 for 2008; $8,814 for 2009; $5,687 for 2010; and \n$5,913 for 2011. He attached a copy of a federal income tax return for 2017, prepared by \na professional tax preparer, reflecting that he was entitled to a refund of $6,019, but he \nsubmitted no evidence showing that the return was filed. He stated that he had a lawyer \nwho was negotiating with the IRS, but he submitted no evidence of payment agreements, \npayments, or other resolution of his tax debts. \n \n \nApplicant earned about $160,000 per year as a linguist in 2007 through 2010. \n(FORM Item 7 at 8.) He submitted no evidence of his current income and expenses. \nAlthough he stated that he was working with a lawyer and an accountant to resolve his \nfinancial problems, he provided no evidence of financial counseling. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother (who is now deceased) and two sisters \nare citizens and residents of Lebanon (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), and his two children reside \nin Lebanon (SOR \u00b6 1.c). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \n \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. The risks posed by crime, terrorism and \narmed conflict in Lebanon, coupled with the fact that Applicant\u2019s children are in the \ncustody of a citizen and resident of Lebanon, are sufficient to establish the \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d in AG \u00b6 7(a) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n\n \n7 \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S; \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are not established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of AG \u00b6 7(a). AG \u00b6 7(c) is not established, because Applicant\u2019s contact with \nhis daughters is frequent and presumptively not casual. See ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent credit card-debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b), a \ndelinquent cellphone bill (SOR \u00b6 2.c), a personal debt of about $50,000 incurred by \nApplicant to his sister (SOR \u00b6 2.d), and past-due federal income taxes totaling about \n$39,000 (SOR \u00b6 2.e). The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \nAG \u00b6 19(f): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required. \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous, recent, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. His debt to his sister is \nnot delinquent, because she has not established a repayment date, but it is a substantial \n\n \n9 \n \nobligation that reflects his overall financial situation, and he has no specific plan to repay \nit. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s illness, his unemployment, \nand his two divorces were circumstances largely beyond his control, but he has not acted \nresponsibly. He states that he is working on his financial problems, but he submitted no \nevidence of contact with creditors, except for the evidence of a payment agreement with \nthe IRS in 2012, and no evidence of payments, payment agreements, disputes, or other \nresolution of his delinquent debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant claims to be working with an attorney and \nan accountant, but he submitted no evidence of the type of financial counseling \ncontemplated by this mitigating condition. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of payments or \nrecent payment agreements. He has promised to pay his debts, but promises to pay debts \nin the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a timely manner. \nISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008). \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant admitted all the debts in his answer to the \nSOR and submitted no evidence that any debts were disputed. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant submitted evidence of a payment \nagreement with the IRS in 2012, and he submitted a copy of a 2017 federal income tax \nreturn, but he submitted no evidence of any payments or current payment agreements.3 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).4  \n \n                                                          \n3 Failure to file tax returns was not alleged in the SOR, but I have noted that Applicant submitted no evidence \nthat his past-due returns have been filed. \n \n4 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B and F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact. Administrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings.1 Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports.2 Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted two of the allegations, with explanations (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.b). He denied the remaining allegation (SOR \u00b61.c). His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. He was born in Afghanistan in 1987. He immigrated to Pakistan when he was five years old with his mother and two siblings. He immigrated to the United States in September 2001. He became a U.S. citizen in 2007. He received two bachelor\u2019s degrees and a master\u2019s degree from U.S. universities. He is employed by a government agency and also works part time as a government contractor, which requires a security clearance. He and his wife are expecting their first child. His wife is a native U.S. citizen. He possesses only a U.S. passport.3 The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s brother is a dual citizen of Afghanistan and Russia, residing in Russia.

The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \nimplemented on June 8, 2017 (AG). \nApplicant answered (Ans.) the SOR on September 5, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On December 19, 2018, the case was assigned \nto me. On December 21, 2018, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \n01/25/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nnotified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for January 8, 2019. I convened the \nhearing on that date. Government exhibit (GE) 1 was admitted in evidence without \nobjection. The Government\u2019s two requests for administrative notice were marked as \nhearing exhibits (HE) I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) A-C, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 16, \n2019. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI took administrative notice of facts concerning Afghanistan and Russia. \nDepartment Counsel provided supporting documents that verify, detail, and provide \ncontext for the requested facts. The specific facts noticed are included in the Findings of \nFact. \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings.1 Usually administrative notice in ISCR proceedings is \naccorded to facts that are either well known or from U.S. Government reports.2  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted two of the allegations, with \nexplanations (SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.b). He denied the remaining allegation (SOR \u00b61.c). His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old. He was born in Afghanistan in 1987. He immigrated to \nPakistan when he was five years old with his mother and two siblings. He immigrated to \nthe United States in September 2001. He became a U.S. citizen in 2007. He received \ntwo bachelor\u2019s degrees and a master\u2019s degree from U.S. universities. He is employed \nby a government agency and also works part time as a government contractor, which \nrequires a security clearance. He and his wife are expecting their first child. His wife is a \nnative U.S. citizen. He possesses only a U.S. passport.3 \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s brother is a dual citizen of Afghanistan and \nRussia, residing in Russia. It also alleged Applicant has multiple family members who \nare citizens and residents of Afghanistan (one is an \u201cAttorney General\u201d of a province \nand another is employed at the Afghan embassy in Bulgaria). Finally, the SOR alleged \nApplicant had a family member that is a citizen of Afghanistan, residing in Pakistan.   \n                                                          \n1 See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd.

He \nhas approximately $40,000 of equity in his home, which has a loan amount of \napproximately $460,000. His financial statement lists bank savings of approximately \n$44,000 and retirement savings of approximately $16,000. He owns no property in \nAfghanistan. He is a registered voter in this country. His mother, one brother, and a \nsister are residents and citizens of the United States. He has not provided financial \nsupport to any relatives outside of the United States, nor has he received any financial \nsupport.4 \n \n \nIn 2016, Applicant established a family chat site through social media at the \nrequest of his mother so she could stay in touch with her family members. The site is \nset up so that once a person becomes a member of the group, then the person has \naccess to all the comments of the other group members. Applicant stated he is not that \nactive on the site. He will assist his mother when she wants to access it, and he may \npost a response to something that his mother wants him to address. For example, \nsending congratulations at the birth of a child, birthday wishes, etc. Not all family \nmembers have joined the group. This chat site is the primary means by which he has \ncontact with his relatives residing outside the United States. Applicant traveled to \nAfghanistan in 2013 with his mother to visit relatives. He stayed approximately one \nmonth. This is the only time he traveled to Afghanistan since leaving as a child. He has \nno future plans to return.5 \n \n \nApplicant has the following relatives who are residents and citizens of \nAfghanistan: \n \n \n1. Applicant\u2019s half-brother (AJ).

He intends to reside there. Department Counsel \nconceded that AD no longer posed security concerns under Guideline B.19 \n \nCharacter Evidence. \n \n \nApplicant supplied character references and work performance appraisals. In his \nappraisal he was rated as \u201cexceeds expectations.\u201d His supervisors and colleagues \ndescribe him as honest, trustworthy, reliable, and transparent. They recommend \ngranting his clearance.20 \n \nAdministrative Notice-Afghanistan. \n \n \nA U.S. State Department travel warning remains in effect for Afghanistan. \nExtremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State of Iraq and \nLevant, and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the \ncountry. Afghanistan continues to experience aggressive and coordinated attacks by the \nTaliban and other terrorist groups. The border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan \nremains a safe haven for terrorists. The country\u2019s most significant human-rights concern \n                                                          \n16 Tr. at 54-55. \n \n17 Tr. at 56-57. \n \n18 Tr. at 57-58; Ans. \n \n19 Tr. at 58-59, 69; Ans.; AE C. \n \n20 Ans. (Exh. A-B). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nduring 2015 was widespread violence, armed insurgent groups\u2019 attacks on civilians, and \nkilling of persons affiliated with the government. \n \nAdministrative Notice-Russia. \n \n \nRussia has a highly centralized, weak multi-party political system dominated by \nthe president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on \ncivil liberties, discrimination, denial of due process, forced confessions, torture, other \nprisoner mistreatment, and the government\u2019s failure to prosecute officials who commit \nserious violations. Government officials also engage in electronic surveillance without \nproper authorization. \n \n \nRussia is one of the most aggressive countries conducting espionage against the \nUnited States, focusing on obtaining proprietary information and advance weapons \ntechnologies beneficial to Russia\u2019s military modernization and economic development. \nRussia\u2019s intelligence services as well as private companies and other entities frequently \nseek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties to Russia who can use their \ninsider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. They also have offered financial \ninducements to U.S. government officials and citizens to encourage them to \ncompromise classified information. Russia\u2019s attempts to collect U.S. technological and \neconomic information represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. security. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows:  \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n\n \n8 \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology.  \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member or friend is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against \nthe United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nrelationship between Afghanistan, Russia, and the United States places a significant, \nbut not insurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his \nrelationships with his relatives living in Afghanistan and Russia do not pose a security \nrisk. Applicant should not be placed in a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist his relatives living in \nAfghanistan and Russia who might be coerced by governmental entities, or pressured \nto assist Afghanistan and Russia.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d21 Furthermore, friendly nations can have profound \ndisagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to their vital \ninterests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged in \nespionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields.  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Afghanistan and \nRussia seek or have sought classified or economic information from or through \nApplicant or his relatives living in Afghanistan and Russia, it is not possible to rule out \nsuch a possibility in the future. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply based upon Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers who are residents and citizens of Afghanistan and Russia.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding:  \n \n                                                          \n21 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest.  \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he has limited contact with his relatives in \nAfghanistan and Russia. He presented sufficient evidence to establish that it is unlikely \nthat he would be placed in a position to choose between the interest of his relatives \nliving in Afghanistan and Russia and those of the United States. While he has numerous \nrelatives in Afghanistan and a brother in Russia, none have any significant relationships \nwith those governments except for his uncle who works in the Bulgarian embassy, but \nwhose family resides in Canada. AG \u00b6 8(a) applies. \n \nApplicant has met his burden to establish his \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d He immigrated to this country when he was 13 \nyears old and became a citizen six years later in 2007. He earned multiple degrees at \nU.S. universities. He married a U.S. citizen and they are expecting their first child. He is \na home owner and has considerable other assets in this country. He has no assets or \nproperty in Afghanistan. His mother, a brother, and a sister are citizens of and reside in \nthe United States. His supervisors and co-workers attest to his loyalty, dedication, and \noverall trustworthiness. The evidence supports that Applicant has longstanding ties to \nthe United States and would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n10 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. The circumstances tending to \nsupport granting Applicant\u2019s clearance are more significant than the factors weighing \ntowards denying his clearance. I considered the recommendations of his co-workers \nand supervisors, who resoundingly recommend that Applicant be granted his security \nclearance. I also considered his strong ties to this country. He has demonstrated his \nlongstanding loyalty to the United States.

Meyer, Esq. \n \n \n11/05/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n  \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the alcohol-related and criminal conduct security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn October 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on November 13, 2018, and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March \n7, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing (NOH) on April 5, 2019, scheduling the hearing for May 7, 2019. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. \n\n \n2 \n \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified, called two witnesses, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through E, which were admitted in evidence without objection. I marked as \nHearing Exhibit (HE) II counsel\u2019s written brief for Applicant. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 21, 2019.                                                                                                               \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. He is 29 years old, single, and does not have any children. (Answer; \nGE 1; AE A). \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2008 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2013. As of the date of the hearing, he had been pursuing his master\u2019s degree since \nlate 2015. He has worked as an engineer for his current employer, a DOD contractor, \nsince 2013, when he was also first granted a security clearance. (Tr. at 5-6, 19-22, 41-\n42, 58; GE 1; AE A, B).  \n \n \nApplicant testified that a number of his college friends remained in the vicinity of \ntheir college after graduation but he moved away. As he traveled for work one to two \nweeks monthly, there was \u201cno social aspect of drinking.\u201d In approximately October \n2016, when he moved back to the area in which his college friends lived, he consumed \nalcohol weekly to monthly at social events. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 1, 3; AE B). \n \n \nWithin the first weekend of his move, Applicant was arrested and charged with \ndriving while intoxicated (DWI), first offense. He had consumed eight to ten beers and \nmixed drinks throughout the course of the day with his college friends while watching \nfootball. He acknowledged that his decision to drive was \u201ccompletely irresponsible\u201d \nsince he was drunk, but he thought \u201cI\u2019m right down the corner . . . I made the mistake of \nthinking I could make it.\u201d He testified that he got a flat tire and attempted to pull over to \nthe side of the road when he was pulled over by the police, questioned, and arrested. \nHe denied that he had been swerving or of having being told such by the officer. He \nacknowledged that he initially denied that he had consumed alcohol that evening \nbecause he was \u201cscared,\u201d but he then admitted to having done so upon further \nquestioning by the officer. His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .26%. (Tr. at 22-59; GE \n1-5, 7; AE A, B, E). \n \n \nApplicant was convicted and sentenced to 180 days confinement with 165 days \nsuspended, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for 12 months with restricted use \npermitted, he was fined $500, and he was ordered to attend and complete an alcohol \nand substance abuse program (ASAP). In December 2016, during pre-trial, he \nunderwent a voluntary substance abuse evaluation as recommended by his DWI \nattorney. The licensed professional counselor (LPC) noted that Applicant expressed \ngenuine concern and regret regarding his DWI, and seemed to be a \u201cresponsible \nindividual who has accomplished his educational goals and maintains an established \ncareer.\u201d She concluded that he did not meet the criteria for any alcohol-related \ndiagnosis. She recommended that he remain abstinent from alcohol and complete a 24-\n\n \n3 \n \nsession alcohol treatment plan due to her concern that he attempted to drive with a \nsignificant BAC. He testified that he remained abstinent throughout the duration of \nASAP, he completed ASAP in approximately January 2018, and the LPC made no \nfurther recommendations upon his ASAP completion. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 1-5, 7; AE A, B, \nD, E). \n  \n \nAs a result of his DWI, Applicant had an ignition interlock device installed in his \ncar in approximately April 2017. Between then and July 2017, he registered a total of \nthree violations. He testified that he believed two of the three violations were false \npositives. He believed the device was triggered on these occasions by the banana and \nprotein shake he consumed for breakfast during his 1.5 hour commute to work, as he \nwould test at a .00% BAC when he would blow into the device again five minutes later. \n(Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B). \n \n \nThe night before his third violation, Applicant testified that he consumed one to \ntwo beers between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm. He set the device off after he ate a banana \nand drank a protein shake during his commute to work that morning. He did not believe \nthat the two beers he consumed the previous night were sufficient to trigger the device. \nHe testified that he pulled over to the side of the road, blew into the device again, and \nregistered a .00% BAC. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B). \n \n \nApplicant was charged with ASAP non-compliance as a result of his three \nviolations. He pled guilty. His suspended confinement for his DWI conviction was \nreduced to 157 days, he was ordered to eight days confinement, which was reduced to \nfour for good behavior, 50 hours of community service, and his probation was extended \nfor one year. He was permitted to retain his restricted driver\u2019s license. He testified that \nhe would have worked remotely from home if he had reason to believe he would trigger \nhis ignition interlock device, and he did not intentionally trigger it and thereby violate his \nprobation. (Tr. at 22-59; GE 2, 5-7; AE A, B). \n \n \nApplicant completed probation in early 2018. These were his only alcohol and \ncriminal-related offenses, and he has not since had any further such incidents. In April \n2019, he voluntarily underwent another substance abuse assessment. The assessment \ncoordinator noted that he did not meet the diagnostic criteria for a current or past \nsubstance use disorder, and no further recommendations for treatment services were \nnecessary. (Tr. at 22-60; GE 2, 7; AE A, B, D). \n \n \nApplicant testified that his family, friends, boss, and security office are aware of \nhis alcohol-related incidents. As of the date of the hearing, he testified that he had not \nconsumed alcohol for several months, he limits himself to one alcoholic drink during \nspecial occasions, and he no longer consumes alcohol to socialize because \u201cit has lost \na majority of its appeal.\u201d He testified that he moved out of the area where his college \nfriends live, and he disassociated from those who have \u201cthe same drinking patterns as \nthey always have;\u201d he has a long-time girlfriend who consumes alcohol responsibly; and \nhe realigned his social groups with individuals who share his same hobbies, to include \ngolf, fishing, and outdoor activities. He testified that he learned from his mistakes, he \n\n \n4 \n \nhas no desire to find himself in the same situation again, and has no future intentions of \nconsuming alcohol and driving. (Tr. at 22-60; GE 2, 7; AE A, B, D). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s first witness, a former member of the U.S. military, testified that he \nhas known Applicant since Applicant came to work for his group in 2013. He testified \nthat he was aware of Applicant\u2019s DWI and interlock violations. He testified that Applicant \nwas promoted in December 2018, becoming one of two senior engineers on a team of \n10 to 12. He testified that Applicant has served as a mentor and group leader, \nresponsible for training new team members. He described Applicant as a model \nemployee and his \u201cgo-to-guy\u201d in the office and on temporary duty overseas. He testified \nthat he has socialized with Applicant after work and he described Applicant as a \n\u201cprofessional\u201d during these occasions. (Tr. at 20, 42-43, 60-78; AE A, C, E). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second witness, a security engineer for a DOD contractor and \nApplicant\u2019s high-school friend, testified that he, too, was aware of Applicant\u2019s DWI and \ninterlock violations. He described Applicant as an upstanding person and believed \nApplicant has since matured. Numerous character references attested to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness and reliability. (Tr. at 20, 42-43, 60-78; AE A, C, E).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22. \nThe disqualifying conditions potentially applicable in this case include:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \n \nApplicant was convicted of DWI and ASAP non-compliance stemming from his \nignition interlock violations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides the following relevant condition that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n\n \n6 \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s convictions for DWI and ASAP non-compliance are isolated incidents. \nThese were his first and only alcohol- and criminal-related offenses. Three years have \npassed since his DWI, his interlock violations occurred nearly two and a half years ago, \nand it has been almost two years since he completed probation. He credibly testified \nthat he has since matured, as demonstrated by his December 2018 promotion to one of \ntwo senior engineers on a team of 10 to 12; his decision to curtail his alcohol \nconsumption; and his disassociation from friends who continue to consume alcohol \nexcessively. He credibly testified that he has no future intentions of driving after \nconsuming alcohol. I find that AG \u00b6 23(a) is established. \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct as: \n\u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(b) evidence (including, but not limited \nto, a credible allegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted.\u201d  \nApplicant was convicted of DWI and ASAP non-compliance stemming from his \nignition interlock violations. AG \u00b6 31(b) is established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n \nFor the same reasons as set forth above in my Guideline G analysis, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and 32(d) apply. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the alcohol consumption and criminal \nconduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the allegations of the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 7.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since September of 2017. (GX 1 at page 12.) He has held a security clearance since June of 2010. (GX 1 at page 57.) He is married, and has thirteen children, seven of whom are \u201cadopted . . . grandchildren.\u2019 (TR at page 11 line 12 to page 15 line 21.) Applicant attributes his past-due indebtedness to a five year period of unemployment, and to a \u201cslip and fall\u201d injury sustained at a grocery store. Applicant\u2019s current salary is about \u201c$120,000,\u201d with \u201c$45,000\u201d in a checking account. (TR at page 39 line 7 to page 40 line 3.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a past-due medical bill in the amount of about $65,000. At his hearing Applicant appears to take issue with this debt. (TR at page 21 line 7 to page 31 line 8, and at page 33 lines 4~18.) However, this alleged past-due debt is supported the Government\u2019s most recent July 2018 credit report. (GX 5 at page 1.) Furthermore, in his Answer, his hospital medical bill shows that his \u201ccopay deductible\u201d has increased to $79,000.

(Answer.) The case was assigned to me on September \n21, 2018. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of \nhearing on September 24, 2018, scheduling the hearing for October 16, 2018. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (GX 1 at page 7.) \nHe has been employed with the defense contractor since September of 2017. (GX 1 at \npage 12.) He has held a security clearance since June of 2010. (GX 1 at page 57.) He \nis married, and has thirteen children, seven of whom are \u201cadopted . . . grandchildren.\u2019 \n(TR at page 11 line 12 to page 15 line 21.) Applicant attributes his past-due \nindebtedness to a five year period of unemployment, and to a \u201cslip and fall\u201d injury \nsustained at a grocery store. Applicant\u2019s current salary is about \u201c$120,000,\u201d with \n\u201c$45,000\u201d in a checking account. (TR at page 39 line 7 to page 40 line 3.) \n \n Guideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \n1.a. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a past-due medical bill in the \namount of about $65,000. At his hearing Applicant appears to take issue with this debt. \n(TR at page 21 line 7 to page 31 line 8, and at page 33 lines 4~18.) However, this \nalleged past-due debt is supported the Government\u2019s most recent July 2018 credit \nreport. (GX 5 at page 1.) Furthermore, in his Answer, his hospital medical bill shows that \nhis \u201ccopay deductible\u201d has increased to $79,000. (Answer at page \u201c52 of 213.\u201d) I find \nthat this substantial medical debt is still outstanding; and as such, this allegation is \nfound against Applicant. \n \n \n1.b. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant also admitted a past-due medical bill in \nthe amount of about $871. At his hearing Applicant again appears to take issue with this \ndebt. (TR at page 37 lines 9~14.) However, this alleged past-due debt is supported the \nGovernment\u2019s November 2017 credit report. (GX 4 at page 8.) I find that this medical \ndebt is still outstanding; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.c. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a past-due medical bill in the \namount of about $328. At his hearing Applicant appears to take issue with this debt. (TR \nat page 37 lines 16~21.) However, this alleged past-due debt is supported the \nGovernment\u2019s November 2017 credit report. (GX 4 at page 8.) I find that this medical \ndebt is still outstanding; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n1.d. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted a past-due medical bill in the \namount of about $184. This alleged past-due debt is also supported the Government\u2019s \nNovember 2017 credit report. (GX 4 at page 8.) I find that this medical debt is still \noutstanding; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n  \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. Although he can attribute much of his \ndebt to an extensive period of unemployment, and to an unexpected medical \nemergency, Applicant has yet to address these debts. He has not demonstrated that \nfuture financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been \nestablished. Guideline F is found against Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Financial \nConsiderations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 55, has two adult children and one minor child. In December 2017, because of his drinking habits, his wife separated from him after 29 years of marriage. A divorce is pending. He received a high school diploma in 1981. He has been employed as a product line manager since 2005, and has maintained his current DOD security clearance since 1996. He previously held a DOD security clearance during his service in the U.S. Air Force from 1981 through 1990. (Item 2; Item 4 at 7). Applicant was arrested and charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) in 1997, 2002, and 2017. He successfully completed alcohol treatment programs in 1996, 2003, and 2018. Each time, his treatment recommendations advised abstention from alcohol. He was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder during treatment in 2003 and 2018. The record does not establish whether a diagnosis was rendered during his 1996 treatment. (Item 1; Item 2 at 29-30, 33-34; Item 4 at 4, 5, 7, 8 11, 12; Item 5; Item 8). During his 2015 and 2018 security clearance interviews, Applicant acknowledged his alcoholism and referred to himself as an alcoholic. He recognized that he consumed alcohol to relieve stress and to avoid his problems. He conceded the poor judgment associated with his alcohol consumption. However, in his 2019 SOR answer, while he admitted the \u201cbad decision\u201d that he made driving after drinking, he believed that his 2017 arrest \u201cwould not have occurred\u201d had it not been for his wife ",

Driskill, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n06/18/2019 \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nMARINE, Gina L., Administrative Judge: \n \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 19, 2015. On \nFebruary 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines G and J. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2019, and requested a decision on the \nrecord without a hearing. On April 29, 2019, the Government sent a complete copy of its \nwritten case, a file of relevant material (FORM) including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 8, to Applicant. He was given an opportunity to submit a documentary response \nsetting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. He received the FORM on May 3, 2019, and did not respond. \n\n \n2 \n \nItem 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 8 are admitted into evidence. \nThe case was assigned to me on June 17, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant, age 55, has two adult children and one minor child. In December 2017, \nbecause of his drinking habits, his wife separated from him after 29 years of marriage. A \ndivorce is pending. He received a high school diploma in 1981. He has been employed \nas a product line manager since 2005, and has maintained his current DOD security \nclearance since 1996. He previously held a DOD security clearance during his service in \nthe U.S. Air Force from 1981 through 1990. (Item 2; Item 4 at 7). \n \nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving while impaired by alcohol (DWI) \nin 1997, 2002, and 2017. He successfully completed alcohol treatment programs in 1996, \n2003, and 2018. Each time, his treatment recommendations advised abstention from \nalcohol. He was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder during treatment in 2003 and \n2018. The record does not establish whether a diagnosis was rendered during his 1996 \ntreatment. (Item 1; Item 2 at 29-30, 33-34; Item 4 at 4, 5, 7, 8 11, 12; Item 5; Item 8). \n \nDuring his 2015 and 2018 security clearance interviews, Applicant acknowledged \nhis alcoholism and referred to himself as an alcoholic. He recognized that he consumed \nalcohol to relieve stress and to avoid his problems. He conceded the poor judgment \nassociated with his alcohol consumption. However, in his 2019 SOR answer, while he \nadmitted the \u201cbad decision\u201d that he made driving after drinking, he believed that his 2017 \narrest \u201cwould not have occurred\u201d had it not been for his wife and daughter pressuring him \nto conduct a safety test on a vehicle with an expired registration. (Item 1; Item 4 at 5 and \n8). \n \nEarlier in the day of his arrest in 2017, Applicant reportedly consumed \u201calmost a \npint\u201d of whiskey at his home. After dinner, believing \u201cenough time had passed\u201d and that \nhe was not impaired, he drove his daughter\u2019s car to test whether its power steering issues \nhad resolved before she drove it to college the following day. An officer stopped him for \nan unspecified reason and then discovered that the vehicle\u2019s registration had been \nflagged for failing an emissions test. After failing field sobriety tests and registering a blood \nalcohol content of .11, Applicant was charged with several offenses, including DWI. In \nFebruary 2018, he pled guilty to DWI for he received probation before judgment, including \nsix months in jail, suspended, and unsupervised probation for three years. (Item 4 at 7; \nItem 5). \n \nApplicant reported two periods of sobriety prior to his 2017 arrest: approximately \none year following his 1997 arrest, and approximately 10 years between 2004 and 2014. \nHe attributed resuming alcohol consumption in about 2014 to the stress associated with \nongoing marital issues. He had been in counseling due to his marital problems in the \nmonths prior to his 2017 arrest, and had attended an AA meeting just days before. (Item \n1; Item 4 at 8, 11 through 13). \n \n\n \n3 \n \nApplicant has not consumed alcohol since his 2017 arrest and intends to stay \nsober. As of April 2018, he had been attending AA meetings three days per week. In \nMarch 2019, he affirmed his desire and motivation to stay sober, particularly since he had \nreportedly suffered a myriad of negative personal and financial consequences after his \n2017 arrest. Because he did not address it in his SOR answer or respond to the FORM, \nthe record does not specify his current relapse prevention or stress management plans, \nincluding whether he continued his AA attendance after April 2018. (Item 1; Item 4 at 8 \nand 13). \n \nPolicies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \n\n \n4 \n \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption, which resulted in three DWIs within \nthe span of 20 years, his relapse after an alcohol use disorder diagnosis in 2003, and his \n2017 alcohol use disorder diagnosis establish the following disqualifying conditions under \nthis guideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder;  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n \nBecause the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f refer to treatment without a diagnosis, they \ndo not independently establish any disqualifying conditions. Accordingly, I must find SOR \n\n \n5 \n \n\u00b6 1.f in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, the fact that he received alcohol treatment in 1996 \nwith a recommendation to abstain from alcohol remained relevant to the underlying \nconcerns. \n \n \nNeither of the following applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nestablished: \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \n \n \n \nThe security significance of Applicant\u2019s 1997 and 2002 DWIs is brought current by \nhis more recent 2017 DWI. Collectively they raise questions about Applicant\u2019s good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant\u2019s prior acknowledgment and \nacceptance of responsibility for his problems with alcohol were undercut by him \nmisplacing blame for his 2017 arrest, in his SOR answer, on his wife and daughter and \nthe car registration issue. I have doubts that Applicant has truly acknowledged and \naccepted his limitations with alcohol. Moreover, given his history, Applicant has not \ndemonstrated a sufficient pattern of modified behavior for me to conclude that his \nexcessive consumption of alcohol and questionable judgment are behind him.  \n \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \n \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI charges, the most recent of which occurred in 2017 and for which \nhe is currently on probation, establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \n \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n\n \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \n \n \nNeither of the following applicable mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nestablished: \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s DWI history establishes a pattern of criminal misconduct that casts \ndoubt about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and calls into question his ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant remains under the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction through at least 2021 in connection with the 2017 DWI. There has not \nbeen a passage of time sufficient to conclude that his questionable judgment and criminal \nmisconduct will not recur.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nfollowing guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and J, and evaluating all the evidence in \nthe context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by the excessive alcohol consumption and criminal misconduct \nunderlying his DWI history and current probation. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried \n\n \n7 \n \nhis burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His late filing \nof his tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017, were attributable to a diagnosed \nmental condition and he is receiving treatment for that condition. Further, he voluntarily \ncorrected his omission of his failure to file those returns on his August 2016 security \nclearance application during his security clearance interview. National security eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 17, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications \nFacility (DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines F, financial considerations and E, personal conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \n03/08/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on October 29, 2018, and \nrequested a decision based on the administrative record. Department Counsel submitted \nthe Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 27, 2018. Applicant \nreceived it on December 7, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 \nthrough 5. The FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the \nFORM. On January 27, 2019, Applicant submitted a 25-page response to the FORM \n(Response). Items 1 through 5 and the Response are admitted into the record without \nobjection. The case was assigned to me on March 4, 2019.  \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nPursuant to Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.2, E3.1.3, E3.1.7, and \nE3.1.13 of the Directive, Department Counsel moved in the FORM to amend the SOR \nissued to Applicant to add an additional allegation, to conform to the evidence. Applicant \nraised no objections to the amendment in his Response and I hereby grant the motion. \nThe SOR \u00b6 1 is amended to include the following: \n \nb. Applicant failed to timely file, as required, Federal income tax returns for the tax \nyear 2017. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a, with clarifications. Applicant failed to admit \nor deny the new allegation, SOR \u00b6 1.b, in his Response. As a result, SOR \u00b6 1.b will be \ntreated as a denial. The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017. The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to disclose \nhis delinquent tax filings when he completed his security clearance application in August \n2016. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is single and has no children. He has been employed \nin government service either as a contractor or a civilian employee since 2002. He was \nawarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award in September 2014, for his work with the \nU.S. Navy. He has held a security clearance since 2006, without incident. (Response; \nAnswer; Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant has been diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder. His \u201cpresenting \nproblems include marked fear or anxiety about possible scrutiny by others, fear of being \nrejected by others, and avoiding situations that might lead to those fears.\u201d (Response.) \nHe has been receiving treatment for this condition weekly since August 2018. His board \ncertified counselor opined that Applicant is \u201cmaking the necessary changes to live a \n\n \n3 \n \n \nhealthier lifestyle and is deeply committed to his treatment and living a life free of anxiety.\u201d \nShe gave him a favorable prognosis. He voluntarily sought treatment for this condition, \nand self-reported it to the government. (Response.) \n \n \nApplicant explained that prior to receiving treatment his anxiety caused him to \n\u201cwithdraw or to become inactive during uncomfortable situations rather than dealing with \nthem directly.\u201d As a result, when he realized he forgot to timely file his 2015 Federal \nincome taxes, his anxiety condition caused him \u201cto ignore [his] oversight rather than [to] \nimmediately file [his] tax returns.\u201d (Response.) With the help of counseling, he has \ndeveloped tools to cope with his anxiety. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2015 and 2016 Federal income tax returns. He \ndocumented that they were filed, along with his 2017 Federal income tax return on April \n25, 2018. His 2017 Federal tax returns were filed seven days late, as that return was due \non April 17, 2018.1 Applicant received refunds for the 2015 through 2017 tax years. He is \nnow current on his required tax fillings, and promised to timely file his income tax returns \nin a timely manner in the future. His new toolset for managing anxiety will aid him in \nfollowing that requirement. (Answer; Response; Item 4; Item 5.) \n \n \nWhen Applicant completed his security clearance Application on August 16, 2016, \nhe answered \u201cno\u201d to question 26, which asked if he had failed to file or pay Federal, state, \nor other taxes as required by law. However, when Applicant was asked this same question \nduring his subject interview on January 19, 2018, Applicant answered, \u201cyes\u201d and \nvoluntarily disclosed that he had not filed his 2015 or 2016 Federal income tax returns. \nHe explained that his failure to list his delinquent 2015 tax returns on his security \nclearance application was due to an oversight.2 (Response; Item 5.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \n                                                          \n1 2018 IRS filing date obtained from https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-2018-tax-filing-season-\nopens-with-april-17-deadline-155-million-tax-returns-projected-70-percent-expect-refunds. \n \n2 Applicant was not required to disclose his delinquent 2016 Federal tax return, as it was not yet delinquent \nat the time he completed the security clearance application.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n\n \n5 \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following is \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his Federal income tax returns in 2015, 2016, and \n2017. There is sufficient evidence to raise substantial security concerns under the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that a person who fails to abide by legal \nobligations, such as filing returns and paying taxes when due, does not exhibit the good \njudgment and reliability expected of those with access to national security information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). Applicant readily admitted \nthat he suffered from a defect in judgment at the time he failed to comply with his \nresponsibilities to file his Federal income tax returns. However, Applicant\u2019s failure to file \nhis 2015 through 2017 Federal income tax returns in a timely manner was attributable to \nhis diagnosed anxiety disorder. He has since sought treatment for his condition, is \nshowing progress, and has a good prognosis. Similar lapses in following the tax filing \nrequirements are unlikely to recur, as evidenced by the letter from his counselor \ndocumenting his treatment progress. Further, all of his delinquent tax returns were filed \nprior to receiving the SOR. He owes nothing to the IRS. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(g) provide \nmitigation. \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n  \nApplicant omitted his failure to file his 2015 Federal income tax return on his August \n2016 security clearance application. However, there is no evidence that Applicant did so \nintentionally. Applicant fully disclosed his failure to file his 2015 and 2016 Federal income \ntax returns when going over his 2016 security clearance application with an investigator, \nbefore being confronted with the facts. The evidence is insufficient to raise AG \u00b6 16(a) \nwith respect to that omission.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has successfully held \na security clearance since 2006, without incident. He was awarded the Meritorious \nCivilian Service Award in September 2014. He has sought and received treatment for his \ndiagnosed anxiety disorder and is making sufficient progress to garner a favorable \nprognosis. He is committed to following through on his responsibilities, now that he has \nthe tools to manage his anxiety disorder. The record evidence leaves me without \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For \nall these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under \nGuidelines F and E.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nNational security eligibility is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nJennifer I.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 55, has worked for her employer (Company A), a federal contracting company since 1991. She was granted access to classified information in 2004. Her eligibility was renewed after a 2014 periodic reinvestigation. In September 2017, Applicant\u2019s employer filed an incident report in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System (JPAS), alerting the DOD CAF that Applicant mishandled Company A proprietary information. This incident is the basis of the SOR. After receiving an allegation of misconduct against Applicant, Company A began an investigation into her use of their IT system. The investigation determined that between December 2016 and September 2017, Applicant downloaded over 150,000 files onto five personal storage devices. The investigation established that Applicant was up to date on Company A training regarding the handling and storage of proprietary information. The investigation also established that Applicant acted in knowing violation of company policy. An audit of Applicant\u2019s activity showed that she initiated at least 23 copy events from the Company A network between December 2016 and September 2017. She admits downloading an unspecified number of files in December 2016, so that she could continue to work during her end-of-year break when the Company A network would not be available to her.

Based on the available information, DOD adjudicators were unable to find that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance and \nrecommended that the case be submitted to an administrative judge for a determination \nwhether to revoke or deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 26, 2018, and requested a decision \nwithout a hearing. The Government submitted its written case on April 22, 2019. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) and the Directive were provided to \nApplicant. She received the FORM on May 8, 2019, and provided a response. The \nattachments to the FORM are admitted to the record as Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 8, and Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is admitted as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \n(AE) A through E, without objection.   \n \n  Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant, 55, has worked for her employer (Company A), a federal contracting \ncompany since 1991. She was granted access to classified information in 2004. Her \neligibility was renewed after a 2014 periodic reinvestigation. In September 2017, \nApplicant\u2019s employer filed an incident report in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System \n(JPAS), alerting the DOD CAF that Applicant mishandled Company A proprietary \ninformation. This incident is the basis of the SOR. \n \n \nAfter receiving an allegation of misconduct against Applicant, Company A began \nan investigation into her use of their IT system. The investigation determined that \nbetween December 2016 and September 2017, Applicant downloaded over 150,000 \nfiles onto five personal storage devices. The investigation established that Applicant \nwas up to date on Company A training regarding the handling and storage of proprietary \ninformation. The investigation also established that Applicant acted in knowing violation \nof company policy.  \n \n \nAn audit of Applicant\u2019s activity showed that she initiated at least 23 copy events \nfrom the Company A network between December 2016 and September 2017. She \nadmits downloading an unspecified number of files in December 2016, so that she could \ncontinue to work during her end-of-year break when the Company A network would not \nbe available to her. In April 2017, Applicant learned that she would be laid off from her \nposition in Group 1 within the following 60 days. In May 2017, Applicant initiated 14 \ndownload events, copying over 59,000 files onto personal storage devices. She claims \nthat she need the files to help her colleagues in Group 1 as needed. She also claims \nthat she began working for Group 2 on a temporary basis in May 2017.  \n \n \nApplicant considered her transition from Group 1 to Group 2 difficult; as it \nrequired her to surrender the computers she used in her Group 1 position and obtain \nnew computers for her position in Group 2. Transferring the files she needed between \nher old and new computers in accordance with Company A policy was also time \nconsuming. In the interest of convenience, Applicant decided to download the files she \nneeded to personal storage devices. She did not want to trouble her new supervisor in \nGroup 2 with the details of the file transfers. She was more focused on impressing him \nwith her performance during her probationary period. Although the investigation \ndetermined that Applicant continued downloading proprietary information until \nSeptember 2017, it does not specify the number of files she downloaded between June \nand September 2017, or Applicant\u2019s reasons for doing so.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nDuring the investigation, Company A interviewed Applicant\u2019s Group 1 and Group \n2 supervisors and had them review the list of the files Applicant downloaded. Neither \ncould identify a legitimate reason for Applicant to have possession of the downloaded \nfiles. According to Applicant\u2019s Group 2 supervisor, Applicant did not join the group until \nJune 2017. Her position was not related to the position she previously held in Group 1 \nand did not require the use of any data from Group 1. According to Applicant\u2019s Group 1 \nsupervisor, Applicant was not expected to continue working on Group 1 projects after \nshe began her position in Group 2.  \n \n \nApplicant returned four of the five storage devices containing the downloaded \nfiles to Company A in September 2017. She could not find the fifth device, but promised \nto surrender if she was able to find it. She claims that she did not disclose the data to \nanyone outside Company A. Ultimately, the investigation concluded that Applicant did \nnot adhere to the expected behavior of Company A employees when she copied \nCompany A proprietary information on external storage devices. She received a \nwarning letter reminding her of her obligation to protect Company A proprietary \ninformation and to adhere to Company A policies regarding the handling and protecting \nproprietary information. She was warned that another violation could result in correction \naction, up to and including discharge from Company A.  \n \n \nCharacter letters from Applicant\u2019s current Group 2 supervisor and other longtime \ncoworkers describe her as trustworthy. They ascribe Applicant\u2019s actions to a \nmisunderstanding of Company A policy.  \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nThe record establishes that Applicant engaged in disqualifying conduct under the \nhandling protected information guideline. An investigation by Applicant\u2019s employer \ndetermined she failed to comply with rules and regulations for handling the company\u2019s \nproprietary information, which raises doubt about her ability to handle and protect \nsensitive and classified information as well as her ability to follow rules and regulations. \nHer misconduct also highlights concerns about her judgment, trustworthiness and \nreliability. (See AG \u00b6 33). Applicant violated her company\u2019s polices regarding the \nhandling of proprietary information by intentionally downloading and saving over \n150,000 files on five personal storage devices between December 2016 and September \n2017. (AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(b) and (c)).  \n \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s actions did not result in the compromise of her employer\u2019s \nproprietary information, her actions continue to reflect negatively on her ongoing \nsecurity worthiness. Her actions were not the result of improper or inadequate training, \nbut intentional conduct meant to circumvent her employer\u2019s procedures, which she \ndeemed time consuming and inconvenient. Furthermore, she failed to maintain physical \nsecurity of the storage devices. Applicant\u2019s conduct also raises significant credibility \nissues. Despite her claims to the contrary, Applicant had no legitimate reason to store \nCompany A proprietary data to personal storage devices. She had no official need for \naccess to the downloaded files outside of duty hours or times when the Company A \nnetwork would be unavailable to her. She had no need to maintain access to the \ndownloaded files during her transition from Group 1 to Group 2 or thereafter. While it \ndoes not appear that Applicant\u2019s actions were motivated by malice against her \nemployer, her actions show that she is willing to put her self interests above those of her \nemployer\u2019s need to protect proprietary information. Accordingly, none of the relevant \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \n \nBased on the record, doubts remain about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \ngood judgment, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. In reaching this \n\n \n5 \n \nconclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors enumerated in AG \u00b6 2(d). \nApplicant has worked for Company A for 23 years and has held a security clearance for \nat least 15 years. Although Applicant\u2019s employer treated her actions as an isolated \nincident of minor misconduct, the government is not obliged to do the same. Applicant is \nnot entitled to retain her security clearance and the government is not required to wait \nuntil she actually mishandles classified information before deciding to revoke her access \nto classified information. The purpose of the security clearance adjudication is to make \n\u201can examination of a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(d)). Applicant \ndemonstrated a willingness to disregard her employer\u2019s rules related to the handling \nand safeguarding proprietary information. In doing so, she displayed poor judgment, \nlack of trustworthiness and reliability that create an unacceptable security risk.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline K:  \n \nAgainst Applicant  \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to \nclassified information. Eligibility denied.  \n \n \n \nNichole L. Noel \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The conditions that resulted in his financial problems \nwere largely beyond his control, and he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \nalso initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his delinquent debts. The \nevidence is sufficient to mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case \nis decided for Applicant.    \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non August 16, 2016. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. Thereafter, on July 6, 2018, after reviewing the application and \nthe information gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \n\n \n2 \n \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguideline known as Guideline F for financial considerations.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 9, 2018. He admitted the six factual \nallegations, and he provided explanations and supporting documentation. He requested \nthat his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Subsequently, on or \nabout October 22, 2018, he retained legal counsel and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. (Tr. 9) \n  \nThe case was assigned to me on April 16, 2019. The hearing took place on June \n11, 2019. Applicant appeared with counsel. Department Counsel offered documentary \nexhibits, which were admitted as Exhibits 1-4. Applicant offered documentary exhibits, \nwhich were admitted as Exhibits A-E. Other than Applicant, no witnesses were called. \nThe hearing transcript (Tr.) was received on June 20, 2019.  \n \nThe record was kept open until July 11, 2019, to provide Applicant an opportunity \nto submit additional documentation. Applicant made a timely submission, and the \nadditional documents are admitted without objections as Exhibits F-J.      \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a security \nclearance. He works as an incident-response analyst in a cyber-center. He has been so \nemployed since August 2016. His formal education includes a high school diploma and \nsome college. His employment history also includes two periods of unemployment: (1) \nfrom April 2016 to August 2016; and (2) from April 2009 to March 2010. The later period \nof unemployment followed his honorable discharge from active duty military service. \n(Exhibit F; Tr. 50-52) He served in the U.S. Army for approximately eight years during \n2001-2009, which included deployments to both Afghanistan and Iraq. He received his \ninitial security clearance for his military duties. Due to a service-connected injury to his \nback, the Department of Veterans Affairs determined he has a 40% disability, and he \nreceives disability compensation of about $730 monthly. (Tr. 52-53; Exhibit B) Applicant \nis married and there are two minor children of the marriage. Married in 2003 and \nseparated in 2016, a divorce is likely to occur in the near future.   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, the six factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 2-4) In particular, the SOR concerns a mortgage loan \nthat went into default followed by foreclosure, as well as four charged-off accounts and \ntwo collection accounts for a total of about $28,413.  \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to marital troubles. In the summer of \n2015, he and his wife decided on an informal separation due to her alcohol abuse and \nextramarital affairs. They continued to live together, with their children, until early 2016 \nwhen she moved out of the marital home. That resulted in a decrease in household \nincome, and Applicant was left with responsibility for their previously shared financial \nobligations. His wife had also assumed responsibility for the household finances, \n\n \n3 \n \nincluding bill-paying. Since their separation, she has declined to provide Applicant any \nfinancial assistance to pay the debts they incurred while they were together. (Tr. 33-34) \nRecently, in May 2019, his wife agreed to the setting of a child-support arrears amount \nat zero and the court so ordered. (Exhibit D) Applicant continues to pay ongoing child \nsupport, via payroll withholding, at the rate of $540 per month. (Tr. 40-41) He described \nhis current relationship with his wife as \u201cpretty amicable,\u201d and they are both focused on \ntheir respective co-parent roles. (Tr. 39-40) \n \nTurning to the matters in the SOR, the first concerns the mortgage loan that went \ninto default followed by foreclosure. (Tr. 23-26; 42-43) Applicant and his wife bought the \nhome in 2012, and the mortgage loan account was in good standing until the marital \nseparation and decline in household income. He was unable to maintain the mortgage \npayments based solely on his income. Since the mortgage loan was a joint account, he \nasked his wife to sign a quit-claim deed but she refused. She also declined to \nparticipate in a state-sponsored save-our-home program. The property was foreclosed \nupon in 2017. \n \nTurning next to the charged-off accounts, the $11,587 charged-off account stems \nfrom a credit card account that Applicant used for both personal expenses and work-\nrelated expenses. (Tr. 26-30; 43) He entered into a payment arrangement with the \ncreditor in November 2016. (Answer to SOR) He has made 30 monthly payments of \n$139 per that arrangement, with the most recent payment in April 2019. (Exhibit C)  \n \nThe $6,819 charged-off credit account stems from a credit card account. (Tr. 30-\n33) Applicant entered into a payment arrangement with the creditor in July 2018. \n(Answer to SOR) He has made 11 monthly payments of $50 per that arrangement, with \nthe most recent payment in May 2019. (Exhibit C) \n \nThe $4,838 charged-off account stems from a credit card account. (Tr. 33-35, 44) \nApplicant entered into a payment arrangement with the creditor in July 2018. (Answer to \nSOR) He has made nine monthly payments of $50 per that arrangement, with the most \nrecent payment in April 2019. (Exhibit C)  \n \n The $3,891 collection account stems from a credit card account. (Tr. 36) The \naccount was charged off and placed for collection with a law firm. In August 2018, \nApplicant agreed to make monthly payments of $325 for 12 months. (Answer to SOR) \nThrough May 2019, Applicant made 10 monthly payments per that arrangement. \n(Exhibit C) The account was paid in full for $3,891 as of July 2019. (Exhibits E and I) \n \nThe $1,278 collection account stems from a credit card account. (Tr. 36-37) The \naccount has been in collection with a law firm since about July 2018, when Applicant \nagreed to make monthly payments of $105 until the account was paid in full. (Answer to \nSOR) Through May 2019, Applicant made 10 monthly payments per that arrangement. \n(Exhibit C) The account was paid in full as of July 2019. (Exhibit J)  \n \nIn addition to addressing the matters in the SOR, Applicant sought out and \nobtained financial counseling from an Army community counseling service, beginning in \n\n \n4 \n \nabout July 2018. He has developed and uses a written budget, which reflects a monthly \nsurplus of more than $1,000. (Exhibit B) He has a good record of employment based on \nperformance reviews and favorable letters of recommendation. (Exhibits A, G, and H) \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The DOHA Appeal \nBoard has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed \nunder the substantial-evidence standard.4 \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6 \n \nDiscussion \n \n \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \n                                                          \n1 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).  \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \n \n \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \n \n \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent:  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.  \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are due to the \ncircumstances surrounding his marital separation, a decline in household income, and \nthe resulting inability to meet financial obligations incurred as a married couple. In \naddition, after moving out from the marital home, his wife refused to cooperate with \nattempting to resolve the mortgage loan, and she also declined to provide financial \nassistance to pay for their bills. Those circumstances were largely beyond his control. \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, as evidenced by the remedial \nactions taken to address his indebtedness. Given the circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(b) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor.   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nApplicant has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to resolve his \nindebtedness. He receives substantial credit for addressing all the delinquent debts in \nthe SOR. He paid off two of the five delinquent accounts, and he has payment \narrangements for the other three. He has made multiple monthly payments on the \naccounts. There is no apparent reason at this point to doubt his willingness and ability to \ncontinue with those payments. Moreover, it does not appear that Applicant was slow to \nact. He has being working on these matters since November 2016, when he made the \nfirst payment arrangement on a charged-off account. As his financial situation improved, \nhe was able to address the others beginning in mid-2018. Taken together, his multiple \nmonthly payments on several accounts establish a track record of adhering to a good-\nfaith effort to resolve his indebtedness. Given the circumstances, the mitigating \ncondition at AG \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n \n \nApplicant presented a good but less than perfect case in mitigation, but, as in all \nhuman affairs, perfection is not the standard. A security clearance case is not a debt-\ncollection procedure. It is a procedure designed to evaluate an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). \nAn applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the financial \nproblems and take significant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement \nthat an applicant make payments on all the delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is \nthere a requirement that the debts alleged in the SOR be paid first. See ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n \n \nHere, I am persuaded that Applicant is making an honest effort to be financially \nresponsible and repay his creditors. There are clear indications that he is repaying his \ncreditors, and his financial problems appear to be under control. With additional time, it \nis probable that he will continue to make the agreed upon monthly payments and \nresolve the remaining three delinquent debts. Taking everything into account, Applicant \ndemonstrated good judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness by persevering under \ndifficult circumstances that were largely beyond his control. The financial considerations \nconcern is mitigated.  \n \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice \nversa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to \ngrant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline B, foreign \ninfluence. Applicant responded to the SOR on September 12, 2018, and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.  \nThe Government\u2019s written case was submitted on September 28, 2018. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, who \nwas afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, \nor mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received the FORM on October 9, 2018. As \nof November 30, 2018, he had not responded. The case was assigned to me on \nFebruary 8, 2019.  \n02/22/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nThe Government exhibits included in the FORM are admitted in evidence. \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts about \nSyria. Applicant did not object, and the request is granted. The facts are summarized in \nthe written request and will not be repeated verbatim. Of particular note is that Syria is \nruled by an authoritarian regime that is currently engaged in a full-scale civil war with \nthe armed Syrian opposition, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths, 5.1 million \nrefugees, and 6.3 million displaced persons inside Syria. The risk of terrorist activities \nin Syria remains extremely high. No section of Syria is safe or immune from violence, \nand the potential exists throughout the country for hostile acts, targeted or random, \nagainst U.S. and other Western nationals at any time. The country\u2019s human rights \nrecord remains poor. Syria is a state sponsor of terrorism. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2013. He has held a top secret security clearance since \n2014, but his eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI) was \ndenied in 2017. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree, awarded in 2012, and a master\u2019s degree, \nawarded in 2015. He is married with one child.1 \n \n \nApplicant was born in Syria to Syrian parents. His brother immigrated to the \nUnited States to attend a religious college and become a missionary. Applicant followed \nhis brother to the United States in 2003 and attended the same religious college as his \nbrother for three years. Applicant obtained his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in the \nUnited States from a different U.S. college. He met his wife, a native-born U.S. citizen, \nat the religious college. They married in 2007. Their child was born in the United States. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 2012. His brother is also a U.S. citizen and \napparently still a Syrian citizen.2 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and three additional siblings are Syrian citizens. His parents \nand one of his siblings are residents of Syria. One sibling is a resident of Egypt, married \nto an Egyptian citizen, and the last sibling is a resident of Austria, married to an Austrian \ncitizen. Applicant\u2019s father is a minister. None of Applicant\u2019s family has any direct \nconnection to the Syrian or Egyptian governments.3 \n \n \nApplicant has not returned to Syria since he left in 2003. He stated that he initially \ndid not return because he did not have the money for the trip, then his Syrian passport \nexpired in about 2007 or 2008, and then the civil war broke out and he had no desire to \nreturn. He does not plan to ever return to Syria. His brother in the United States did \nsome missionary work in Syria, but he stopped going after the war began. Applicant and \n                                                          \n1 Item 3-5 \n \n2 Items 2-5. \n \n3 Items 2-5. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nhis brother met their parents, siblings, and siblings\u2019 spouses in Lebanon in 2015 for a \nfamily reunion.4 \n \n \nApplicant does not have any foreign assets in Syria. He earns more than \n$100,000 per year. He gave his parents $200 during his 2015 trip. That is his only \nfinancial support to his family in Syria.5 \n \n \nApplicant did not appeal the denial of his eligibility for access to SCI. He \nexplained that he was not working on a program that required SCI access, and his \nfacility security officer and supervisor both told him that they had plenty of work for him \nthat only required a top secret clearance.6 \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n                                                          \n4 Items 3-5. \n \n5 Items 4, 5. \n \n6 Items 4, 5. \n\n \n4 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n\n \n5 \n \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents and three siblings are Syrian citizens. His fourth sibling is a \ndual U.S. and Syrian citizen living in the United States. His parents and one sibling are \nresidents of Syria. His remaining two siblings are residents of Egypt and Austria. Syria \nis ruled by an authoritarian regime that is currently engaged in a full-scale civil war with \nthe armed Syrian opposition. The risk of terrorist activities in Syria remains extremely \nhigh. The country\u2019s human rights record remains poor. Syria is a state sponsor of \nterrorism. Applicant\u2019s foreign family members create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Syria. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant followed his brother to the United States in 2003 to attend the same \nreligious college as his brother. He met his wife, a native-born U.S. citizen, at the \nreligious college. Their child was born in the United States. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since 2013, and he earns more than $100,000 per year. He has held a \ntop secret security clearance since 2014. He does not own any assets in Syria. He has \nnot been back to Syria since 2003, and he has no intention of returning. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nIt is unclear what has changed since Applicant received a top secret security \nclearance in 2014, with the exception that the violent and volatile situation in Syria has \ndeteriorated even more. Nonetheless, Applicant has had four more years of establishing \nhis ties to the United States. I find that it is unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position \nof having to choose between the interests of the United States and the interests of the \nSyrian government, a terrorist organization, or his Syrian family members. I further find \nthere is no conflict of interest, because Applicant has such deep and long-standing \nrelationships and loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is partially applicable. AG \u00b6 \n8(b) is applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline B in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nAugust 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF.

It was \ndismissed in March 2016 at his request. (FORM Item 10.) His petition listed secured debts \ntotaling $454,125 (including a home mortgage loan with a balance of $375,298 and four \ndelinquent car loans, including one loan for a luxury car), and unsecured debts totaling \n$169,800. (Form Item 11 at 11, 20.) He listed his net monthly income as $8,018 and his \nspouse\u2019s net monthly income as $2,902. (FORM Item 11 at 24.) In his answer to the SOR, \nhe attributed this bankruptcy petition to overspending on his most recent wedding. He \ndismissed the bankruptcy so that he could resolve his financial problems himself. \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he supports his disabled \nmother, and he was providing financial assistance to his 31-year-old daughter by making \nher car payments and insurance payments. His daughter is now making her own car and \ninsurance payments. Applicant surrendered the car he bought for his daughter and now \nowes a deficiency of $3,000 after the voluntary repossession. The deficiency is not \nalleged in the SOR.  \n \nApplicant also stated that his job required a relocation across the country, and he \nwas unable to sell his home for seven months at his old work location. However, he was \nable to restructure his mortgage payment and is renting his previous home. (AX A.) His \nwife has found employment at their new location, with a starting salary of $96,000 per \nyear, a $27,000 pay increase.  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he submitted a copy of his contract with a \nlaw firm he hired in October 2018 to assist him in challenging errors on his credit reports \n(AX C.) A September 2018 credit report reflects a disputed debt, but it appears that this \ndispute was filed before Applicant hired the law firm. (FORM Item 7 at 6.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges the two Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b), \nthe Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and five delinquent debts incurred after \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.h). Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy \nfilings and delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from February 2001 (FORM \nItem 5), October 2014 (FORM Item 6) and September 2018 (FORM Item 7.) The evidence \nconcerning these debts is summarized below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: car loan charged off for $12,944. Applicant explained that he \npurchased this car for his brother, who failed to make the payments. Applicant \nsurrendered the car to the creditor, who sold it. He submitted evidence of a settlement \nagreement in which the creditor agreed to accept $3,900, payable in 24 monthly $60 \n\n \n4 \n \ninstallments, to begin in August 2018.2 He did not submit documentation showing that \nany payments have been made.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f: collection accounts for two debts to the same creditor \nfor $10,434 and $3,199. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that both accounts \nwere current. The SOR alleges the name of the creditor and amounts similar to the \namounts reflected in the credit reports, but it does not provide the account numbers for \nthese two debts. The October 2014 credit report reflects two accounts with this creditor, \nboth of which are reported as current. (FORM Item 6 at 7-8.) The September 2018 credit \nreport also reflects two accounts with this creditor. One debt has the same account \nnumber as one of the debts in the October 2014 credit report and one has a different \naccount number. One is past due for $63 and the other is past due for $265. No other \ndebts to this creditor are listed in either credit report. The credit reports establish that the \naccounts are either current or than the amount of the debt has been substantially reduced.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: credit-card account placed for collection of $1,772. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he submitted evidence of a payment agreement providing for monthly \n$25 payments, but he provided no documentary evidence that any payments had been \nmade.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: credit-card account charged off for $463. In Applicant\u2019s answer to \nthe SOR, he admitted this debt and promised to make arrangements to pay it. The \nSeptember 2018 credit report reflects that this debt was charged off for $463 and that it \nis disputed. The record does not reflect the basis for the dispute. (FORM Item 7 at 6.) The \ndebt is not resolved. \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n                                                          \n2 It is unclear whether Applicant\u2019s evidence contains the whole agreement, because the total amount of the \nagreed payments (24 payments of $60) is $1,440, less than the agreed settlement amount. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n\n \n6 \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d); AG \u00b6 19(b) (\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do \nso\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following \nmitigating conditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s two divorces adversely affected his \nfinances and were conditions largely beyond his control. However, Applicant presented \nno evidence of reasonable efforts to resolve his debts before resorting to Chapter 7 \n\n \n7 \n \nbankruptcy. It is not clear whether Applicant\u2019s geographical relocation was voluntary or \ninvoluntary, but it had financial consequences when he was unable to sell his home and \nhis wife left her employment. However, the end result was to Applicant\u2019s financial benefit, \nespecially with respect to the dramatic increase in his wife\u2019s income. His brother\u2019s failure \nto make the car payments caused the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d and was a condition beyond his \ncontrol. However, he has not demonstrated responsible conduct regarding this debt \nbecause he presented no evidence that he made payments under the agreement he \nreached with the creditor. He has not presented any evidence of conditions beyond his \ncontrol that caused the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.h. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant hired a law firm to assist him in challenging \nincorrect information on his credit reports, but there is no evidence that the law firm \nprovided him with the financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating condition. He \nreceived financial counseling in connection with his three bankruptcy filings, but he has \nnot reached the point where there are \u201cclear indications\u201d that his financial problems are \nunder control. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established for the two debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, because \nthe credit reports reflect Applicant\u2019s substantial progress in resolving them. It is not \nestablished for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.g, because he presented no \ndocumentary evidence of payments. It is not established for the debt alleged in SOR 1.h, \nbecause he presented no evidence of payments, a payment agreement, or other \nresolution of the debt. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. The September 2018 credit report reflects that the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h debt is disputed, but Applicant submitted no evidence regarding \nthe basis for the dispute or resolution of the debt. \n. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).3  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \n                                                          \n3 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding \nthe conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for \nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nadditional comment. Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for ten years. He has \nworked for his current employer for 15 years and has held a security clearance. However, \nhe has a long history of financial problems. He has been overly indulgent in his generosity \nto his brother and his adult daughter, and he has not yet resolved the debts incurred on \ntheir behalf. His Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition was triggered by his overspending on his \nmost recent wedding. Because he requested a determination on the record without a \nhearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. \nSee ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.e and 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \nLeRoy F.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on September 11, 2015. On \nJuly 20, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline F. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 4, 2018, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing.

See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016).   \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially relevant:  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \n \nAG\u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment were \nconditions largely beyond his control and were reflected in his SCA and verified in the \nPSI. However, he has provided no details and no documentation of the financial impact \nof his son\u2019s illness or the deaths in the family. He also failed to establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He provided no information about his income and \nexpenses. He provided no documentary evidence of payments, payment agreements, \n\n \n6 \n \ncontacts with creditors, negotiations, or other efforts to resolve the debts alleged in the \nSOR. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) are not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of \ncounseling, and he has not disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant stated his intent to pay all the debts \nalleged in the SOR, but promises to pay delinquent debts are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of paying debts in a timely manner. ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. \n19, 2008). He claimed that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f were paid, but he \nprovided no documentary evidence to support his claim. When applicants claim that \ndebts have been resolved, they are expected to present documentary evidence to \nsupport their claims. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016). \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).2  \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent \ndebts. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n                                                          \n2 The factors are: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n7 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Superseded by DoD Manual 5200.02.) \n \nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on August 26, 2017.  (Government Exhibit 3.)  On July 16, 2018, the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD), issued an SOR detailing the trustworthiness concerns \nunder Guideline F Financial Considerations regarding Applicant.  The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \n\n \n2 \n \namended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 13, 2018.  She requested that her case \nbe decided by an administrative judge on the written record without a hearing.  On \nAugust 23, 2018, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case. A \ncomplete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, was \nmailed to Applicant on August 28, 2018, and received by her on September 24, 2018.  \nThe FORM notified Applicant that she had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of her receipt of the \nFORM. Applicant responded to the FORM on October 24, 2018, and the documents are \nmarked and admitted into evidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.  Applicant did not object to \nItems 1 through 5, and they are admitted into evidence, hereinafter referenced as \nGovernment Exhibits 1 through 5.  Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, \neligibility for a public trust position is denied.    \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 50 years old.  She has been divorced three times: 1990, 1999, and \n2009; and has six children, ages 30, 28, 25, 21, 19 and 11.  She has two Master\u2019s \ndegrees.  She holds the position of Billing Manager and is seeking access to sensitive \ninformation in connection with her employment.    \n \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \n \nThe Government opposes Applicant\u2019s request for access to sensitive information \non the basis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following \nfindings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR. \n \nThe Government alleges that Applicant is not eligible for a public trust position \nbecause she is financially overextended and at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to \ngenerate funds.  The SOR identified fourteen delinquent debts totaling in excess of \n$59,000.  Applicant admitted allegations 1.c., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., totaling almost \n$20,000 in debt.  She denied the remaining allegations, or denied them in part, under \nthis guideline.  Credit reports of the Applicant dated September 22, 2017; and May 18, \n2018, reflect that the debts are still owing.  (Government Exhibits 4 and 5.)  Applicant \nserved in the United Sates Navy from June 1986 to December 1987 when she received \nan honorable discharge.  She has worked for his current employer since May 2017. \n       \n \nWhen Applicant started working for her current employer, she states that she had \nevery intention of developing a plan to resolve her debts.  Since then, she has \nexperienced a series of major life events that have hindered her progress.  Over the last \nyear, Applicant learned that her father\u2019s cancer returned.  She took a leave of absence \nin January and again in February to be with him.  He passed away in February 2018.  \nApplicant\u2019s own failing heath brought on by grief and stress took a toll on her, and she \n\n \n3 \n \nunderwent a surgery in August 2018, and a short period of disability.  Her step mother is \nin her final stages of life, suffering from stage 4 brain cancer.  Applicant states that \nthese tragic life events prevented her from focusing on her financial issues.  In her \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant stated that she has now taken the necessary step to \nrectify her financial delinquencies.  In the way of documentary evidence, Applicant \nprovided two pay stubs to show that she is making her child support payments, flight \nand funeral costs relating to her father\u2019s passing, her disability documentation, and two \ncredit reports dated October 21, 2018.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n \n \nThe following debts set forth in the SOR became delinquent and owing: \n \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to a creditor on an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $18,567.  Applicant has satisfied this debt.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit \nA, and credit report dated October 21, 2018, pg. 3.)                 \n \n1.b.  Applicant is indebted to a county for child support arrears in the approximate \namount of $15,549.  Applicant stated that she has consistently made her child support \npayments through payroll deductions.  Her arrearage has been reduced some but she \nstill owes approximately $13,138.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and credit report dated \nOctober 21, 2018, pg. 5.)         \n \n1.c.   Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $6,763.  Following her last divorce and custody matter in 2012, \nshe could no longer afford the vehicle.  The debt remains owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, \nand credit report dated October 21, 2018, pg. 7.)              \n \n1.d.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed in \ncollection in the approximate amount of $3,689.  The debt remains owing.  (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A, and credit report dated October 21, 2018, pg.11.)             \n \n1.e.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was past due in the \napproximate amount of $3,419.  The debt remains owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)          \n \n1.f.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe in the approximate amount of $1,689.  The debt remains owing.

Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $4,406.  Applicant stated that she disputed the debt and it \nhas been removed from her credit report.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)              \n \n1.h.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $2,169.    The debt remains owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, \nand credit report dated October 21, 2018, pg. 9.)        \n \n\n \n4 \n \n1.i.   Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $1,033.  The debt remains owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, \nand credit report dated October 21, 2018, pg. 9.)       \n \n1.j.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $1,026.  The debt remains owing.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)      \n          \n1.k.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $487.  Applicant stated that the debt has been \nreduced to $136.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and credit report dated October 21, 2018, pg. \n10.)       \n \n1.l.   Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $304.  Applicant stated that the debt has been \nreduced to $165.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A, and credit report dated October 21, 2018, pg. \n10.)         \n \n1.m.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a medical account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $260.  Applicant stated that she has disputed \nthe debt, and it has been removed from her credit report.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)    \n          \n1.n.  Applicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection in \nthe approximate amount of $195.  Applicant stated that this debt was paid in full on April \n12, 2016.  Although it still appears on Applicant\u2019s credit reports she plans to dispute the \ndebt with the credit bureaus.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision.  The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept.  The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \n\n \n5 \n \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:       \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debt regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial distress.  She is excessively indebted to a \nnumber of creditors totaling approximately $59,000.  The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand    \n  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nIt is acknowledged that Applicant has had a tough year with the serious illness \nand death of her father, her illness, surgery, and related time off work, as well as her \nstep mother\u2019s ongoing condition.  These circumstances were admittedly beyond her \ncontrol and obviously caused Applicant to spend more money than she could afford, \nwhich hindered her ability to pay her delinquent debt.  However, Applicant has been \nworking for her current employer since May 2017.  She has done little in the way of \nshowing that she can resolve her delinquent debts.  In fact, she has not shown that she \nhas even set up payment plans with the creditors that she is following, nor has she \nshown that she has made any effort to contact her creditors to resolve her debt.   \n \nApplicant stated that she has reduced a couple of her smaller debts.  However, \nknowing that the Government was concerned about her excessive financial \nindebtedness, she has not demonstrated a good-faith effort to take control of her \nfinancial affairs.  Most of the delinquent debt set forth in the SOR remains owing.  \nApplicant has not demonstrated sufficient responsibility toward her delinquent debt.  \nNow, she states that she is going to resolve the debt, but it is too late.   In this case, \nnone of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  There is no clear evidence in the \nrecord that she has acted reasonably and responsibly.  The record fails to establish \nsufficient mitigation of financial trustworthiness concerns under the provisions of AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a) through 20(g). \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a position of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is a mature adult, \nwho has failed to demonstrate that she can live within her means, budget her income \naccordingly, and pay her bills in a timely fashion.  At this point, her financial problems \ncontinue as there is no evidence that they have been resolved.   \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with serious doubt as to Applicant\u2019s \njudgment, eligibility, and suitability for a public trust position.  She has not met her \nburden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising under the guideline for Financial \nConsiderations. \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \nSubparagraph 1.i.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m.:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue national security \neligibility for a public trust position for the Applicant. \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel\n For Applicant: Pro se \n05/08/2019 \n Decision\n  ______________ \nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge: \nBased upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, I conclude that Applicant \nfailed to mitigate the security concerns regarding his financial considerations. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn August 17, 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing reasons \nwhy DOD adjudicators could not make the affirmative determination of eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and Security Executive Agent, Directive 4, National Adjudicative \nGuidelines (SEAD 4), effective June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 7, 2019, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the basis of the written record. Applicant received the File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on February 12, 2019, and interposed no objections to the materials in \nthe FORM. Applicant timely supplemented the FORM with a February 2019 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy discharge. Applicant\u2019s post-FORM submission was received without \nobjections and admitted as Item 7. The case was assigned to me on April 24, 2019. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to pay his federal income taxes for \ntax years 2000-2004 and 2007; (b) failed to file and pay his federal income taxes as \nrequired 2014-2015; (c) Is indebted to the Federal Government for delinquent taxes in \nthe approximate amount of $28,000; (d) is indebted to the Federal Government for a tax \nlien entered against him in May 2015 for $4,728; and (e) accumulated ten delinquent \ndebts exceeding $17,000. Allegedly, these federal taxes owed and delinquent debts \nremain unresolved and outstanding. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the alleged debts with \nexplanations. He claimed that for several years he was financially unstable. Further, he \nclaimed that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in December 2018 and included \nall of the listed SOR debts in his bankruptcy petition. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 58-year-old electronics technician for a defense contractor who \nseeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by \nApplicant are incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional \nfindings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married his first spouse in September 1979, and divorced in June 1993. \n(Item 2) He remarried in April 1997 and divorced her in June 1998. He has no children \nfrom either marriage. Applicant attended college classes between January 1985 and \nSeptember 1997 and earned an associate\u2019s degree. (Item 2) He reported no military \nservice. \nSince April 2016, Applicant has worked for his current employer. (Items 2-3) \nPreviously, he worked for other employers in various types of positions. (Items 2-3) He \nreported unemployment between January 2014 and August 2015. (Items 2-3) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nRecords confirm that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax \nyears 2000-2004, 2007, and 2014. (Items 3-6) Reportedly, he accrued aggregate \ndelinquent taxes exceeding $44,000 for these years. To date, he has not provided any \ndocumentation of filing his federal returns or making payments on his owed federal taxes \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nfor these years. In March 2013, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a federal tax lien \nagainst Applicant in the amount of $12,630. The lien does not specify what years the lien \ncovers. (Item 4) Asked about this 2013 tax lien in his personal subject interview (PSI) with \nan agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in January 2018, Applicant \nexpressed his belief that the total amount of taxes he owed for tax years 2000-2004 and \n2007 approximated $28,000, but could not be sure. (Item 3) His estimate bears some \napproximation to the sum covered by the 2013 federal tax lien and may possibly \nrepresent an over-estimate of taxes owed for these tax years. Without more information \nfrom Applicant, though, no firm inferences can be drawn. Taxes covered by the 2013 tax \nlien and any additional taxes owed for these years that make up Applicant\u2019s $28,000 \nestimate have neither been paid nor otherwise resolved or reconciled to date. \nIn May 2015, the IRS entered a second tax lien to cover calculated taxes owed for \ntax years 20l4 and 2015. (Items 3-4) This lien has not been satisfied and remains \nunresolved.  Besides his federal tax debts, Applicant is indebted to medical and consumer \ncreditors holding delinquent accounts exceeding $17,000. (Items 4 and 6-7) Before \npetitioning for Chapter 7 protection in 2015, these debts had not been addressed by \nApplicant. \nIn December 2018, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. (Item \n7) What asset and claims schedules Applicant included in his Chapter 7 petition are not \ndocumented. Without any special exceptions noted in his discharge order, his bankruptcy \ndischarge is presumed to cover and discharge his SOR-listed medical and consumer \ndebts. Absent special circumstances not developed in his Chapter 7 petition, none of his \ntax debts with the IRS were discharged in bankruptcy. \nApplicant attributed some of his debt delinquencies to unemployment conditions. \n(Item 3) In his PSI with an OPM investigator in January 2018, Applicant described his \nfinancial situation \u201cas terrible\u201d and assured that he would begin making monthly payments \non all of his listed debts. (Item 3) To date, however, he has provided no evidence of \npayments or payment plans with any of his listed  creditors. \nFurther, Applicant has not provided any evidence of financial counseling, \nperformance evaluations, or civic contributions relevant and material to making a whole-\nperson assessment of his trustworthiness and reliability. Without this additional \ninformation, whole-person assessments are limited to his finances \nPolicies \nThe SEAD 4, App. A lists guidelines to be used by administrative judges in the \ndecision-making process covering security clearance cases. These guidelines take into \naccount factors that could create a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, \nas well as considerations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and \nmany of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. The guidelines do not require \nadministrative judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. Each of the guidelines is to \nbe evaluated in the context of the whole person in accordance with App. A. AG \u00b6 2(c) \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, administrative judges must take into account the \npertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in App. A, AG \n\u00b6 2(d) of the AGs, which are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial \ncommonsense decision based upon a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines \nwithin the context of the whole person. \nThe adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of an \napplicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant is \nan acceptable security risk. The following App A, AG \u00b6 2(d) factors are pertinent: (1) the \nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral chances; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent in this case: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse of \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .  AG \u00b6 18. \nBurden of Proof \nBy virtue of the principles and policies framed by the AGs, a decision to grant or \ncontinue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding \nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest. Because the Directive \nrequires administrative judges to make a commonsense appraisal of the evidence \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that \nevidence. See United States, v. Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509-511 (1995). \nAs with all adversarial proceedings, the judge may draw only those inferences \nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the \njudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture. \nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) it must prove by substantial \nevidence any controverted facts alleged in the SOR, and (2) it must demonstrate that \nthe facts proven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain \na security clearance. The required materiality showing, however, does not require the \nGovernment to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled or \nabused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance. Rather, \nthe judge must consider and weigh the cognizable risks that an applicant may \ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or \ncontroverted facts, the evidentiary burden shifts to the applicant for the purpose of \nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation, \nor mitigation. Based on the requirement of Exec. Or. 10865 that all security clearances \nbe clearly consistent with the national interest, the applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating his or her clearance eligibility. \u201c[S]ecurity-clearance determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d See Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s failure to file federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2000-2004, 2007, and 2014-2015; his accrual of delinquent tax \ndebts exceeding $44,000, and his accumulation of delinquent medical and consumer \ndebts exceeding $17.000. Applicant\u2019s tax filing failures and debt delinquencies warrant \nthe application of four of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts, regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d; and 19(f), \u201cfailure \nto file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to \npay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted tax return filing lapses and accumulated delinquent debts \nnegate the need for any independent proof. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.14; \nMcCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 (6th ed. 2006). Each of Applicant\u2019s admitted debts are \nfully documented and create some judgment issues. See ISCR Case 03-01059 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nentitles him to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving tax filing lapses \nand debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving federal and state tax \ndelinquencies and other debt delinquencies are critical to an assessment of an \napplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following rules and \nguidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to holding a \nsensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2016); ISCR \nCase No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s cited circumstances (i.e., \nunemployment) are somewhat extenuating and entitle Applicant to partial mitigation \ncredit for his inability to address his debt delinquencies. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that \nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce \nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has \npartial application to Applicant\u2019s situation, but is very limited to his medical and \nconsumer debts which are legally imputed to be covered in his February 2019 \nbankruptcy discharge. Of no extenuating benefit are his multiple failures to file his \nfederal tax returns for the tax years in issue, as required by law, and his listed federal \ntaxes covered by federal tax liens. \nBecause bankruptcy discharges are presumed to cover non-scheduled, non-\npriority unsecured debts, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed medical and consumer debts are \ncovered by Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy discharge, irrespective of their inclusion in his \nbankruptcy schedules. This is because that in the absence of fraud in a no-asset case \n(as Applicant\u2019s appears to be) all unsecured, nonpriority debts are considered \ndischarged when the bankruptcy court grants a discharge, even when they are not listed \nin a bankruptcy schedule. See Judd v. Wolfe, 78 f.3d 110, 114 (3rd  Cir. 1996); Francis v. \nNat\u2019l revenue Service, Inc. 426 B.R. 398 (Bankr. SD Fl 2010) \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of \nfederal and state tax debts. ISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014); \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008); ISCR Case No. 98-0761 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 27, 1999). In Applicant\u2019s case, his multiple failures to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for the years in issue, as required by law, and his inability to \nestablish documented payment initiatives with the IRS to address his unresolved federal \ntax liens and other delinquent taxes owed for tax years 2000-2004 and 2007, both \nbefore and after the initiation of the security clearance process, preclude favorable \nfindings and conclusions with respect to raised security concerns over the state of his \nfinances. Credited to Applicant are his discharged medical and consumer debts covered \nby SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.o. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Assessment \nWhole-person assessment is unfavorable to Applicant. He has shown insufficient \nprogress to date in addressing his delinquent debts to merit enough positive credit to \nmitigate financial concerns. Overall, Applicant\u2019s actions to date in fulfilling his tax-filing \nresponsibilities and addressing his finances reflect too little evidence of restored \nfinancial responsibility and judgment to overcome reasonable doubts about his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 18. \nConclusions are warranted that his finances are not sufficiently stabilized at this time to \nmeet minimum eligibility requirements for holding a security clearance. Eligibility to hold \na security clearance under the facts and circumstances of this case is inconsistent with \nthe national interest. \nFormal Findings \nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the \ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I \nmake the following formal findings: \nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e:\nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.o:\n Against Applicant \n   For Applicant \nConclusions \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to \nhold a security clearance.

Applicant responded to the SOR on an indeterminate date and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nJune 12, 2019.  \n \nThe hearing was scheduled for August 22, 2019, but was continued at \nApplicant\u2019s request. The hearing was convened as rescheduled on October 9, 2019. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were \nadmitted without objection. The record was held open for Applicant to submit additional \ninformation. He submitted an e-mail and attached documents that I have marked AE F \nand G and admitted without objection. \n\n \n2 \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since 2001. He seeks to retain a security clearance. He attended \ncollege for a period, but he did not earn a degree. He married in 1990 and divorced in \n2012. He married for the second time in 2014. He has four children and two \nstepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 30-31, 42-43; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid federal and state \ntaxes. He has been paying the IRS through a payment plan for several years. His state \nfiled tax liens against him for $8,530 in 2007; $6,408 in 2011; and $8,727 in 2015. His \nfinances became worse after his divorce, and he worried that he could lose his house to \nforeclosure or his state would seize it because of the unpaid taxes. He decided that \nChapter 13 bankruptcy was his best recourse. (Tr. at 27-35; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 4-6) \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in May 2015. Under Schedule D, \nCreditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed $247,368 in claims, including \n$245,592 owed on a mortgage loan. Under Schedule E, Creditors Holding Unsecured \nPriority Claims, the petition listed an \u201cUnknown\u201d amount owed in state taxes. The \npetition listed $3,937 in debts under Schedule F, Creditors Holding Unsecured \nNonpriority Claims. Applicant\u2019s state filed a claim for $23,156 in taxes, penalties, and \ninterest for tax years 2004, 2005, and 2006. (Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE D, \nG) \n \n \nThe bankruptcy plan, which was approved in February 2016, called for monthly \npayments of $675 for months 1 through 11; $800 for months 12 through 15; $1,000 for \nmonths 16 through 21; $1,200 for months 22 through 33; and $1,425 for months 34 \nthrough 60. Court records indicate the payments were automatically withheld from \nApplicant\u2019s paychecks. (Tr. at 20; GE 2; AE G) \n \n \nApplicant was nervous about losing his house, and he sought advice from a \ncompany that specializes in assisting individuals facing foreclosure. He was advised to \nfile another Chapter 13 bankruptcy case. Either there was a miscommunication between \nApplicant and the company, or the company provided him poor advice because he was \nalready in an active bankruptcy case. He filed a second Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in \nSeptember 2018. In October 2018, the bankruptcy court consolidated the two cases \nunder the case number of the first case. (Tr. at 17-19, 24; GE 3; AE B) \n \n \nIn March 2019, Applicant\u2019s state filed a claim in the 2018 bankruptcy case for \n$7,735 in taxes, penalties, and interest for tax year 2006. I am satisfied that this was the \nstate covering itself for the second bankruptcy case, and does not reflect additional \ntaxes to what the state claimed in the 2015 case. (Tr. at 26-27; GE; AE F, G) \n \nApplicant completed the payments required by the bankruptcy court, and his \ndischargeable debts were discharged in August 2019. The trustee\u2019s report indicates that \nApplicant paid $51,576 into the plan, and had $3,752 refunded to him, leaving a net of \n\n \n3 \n \n$47,823 that was paid to his attorney, trustee, and creditors. Of that amount, $5,355 \nwas paid to his attorney and the trustee, and the remainder to his creditors. The trustee \npaid $18,741 toward Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan and $23,156 to Applicant\u2019s state for his \nincome taxes. (Tr. at 25; GE; AE E-G) \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s state released a 2011 tax lien for $7,004 in June 2018. The state \nreleased the 2011 tax lien for $6,408 (SOR \u00b6 1.c) in January 2019. The $8,530 tax lien \nfrom 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and the $8,727 tax lien from 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.d) were still in effect \nin July 2018. There is no direct evidence that they have been released. However, I am \nsatisfied that all of the underlying taxes owed to his state were paid by the trustee. (Tr. \nat 36-37; GE; AE A, C, F, G) \n \n \nApplicant received financial counseling as a requirement of his bankruptcy. His \nfinances are currently in order. He credibly stated that he is committed to fiscal \nresponsibility and paying his taxes when due. (Tr. at 26, 29-31, 41-44; GE 2) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n4 \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ncase and unpaid state taxes. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying \nconditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s divorce exacerbated his financial problems, but his tax issues predate \nhis divorce. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal applicability. He completed the payments required \nby the bankruptcy court, and his dischargeable debts were discharged in August 2019. \nThe trustee paid $23,156 to Applicant\u2019s state for his income taxes, and I am satisfied \nthe state taxes are paid. He received financial counseling as a requirement of his \nbankruptcy. His finances are currently in order. He credibly stated that he is committed \nto fiscal responsibility and paying his taxes when due. \n \n \nI find that Applicant established a plan to resolve his financial problems, and he \ntook significant action to implement that plan. He acted responsibly and made a good-\nfaith effort to pay his debts. His financial problems are under control. They occurred \nunder circumstances that are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d) and 20(g) are \napplicable.  \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n",

He has been cohabitating for two years with a Chinese national, who recently applied for citizenship in the United States. (Tr. 36) She has a green card. Applicant reported some college but no degree. (Tr. 39-40) He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1983 to 2004 and attained the rank of Chief Warrant Officer-3 (CWO-3).

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n     Statement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 7, 2016. \nOn September 26, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations. An amended SOR, was subsequently \nissued under Guideline F, alleging a child-support arrearage, and under Guideline B, \nforeign influence. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AGs) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely answered the SOR with a detailed six-page answer, admitting \nthat at one time he owed most of the delinquent debts alleged, but he has since \n03/15/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \nresolved all but two of the alleged delinquencies. He attached documentary evidence to \nhis Answer with explanations. Applicant answered the amended SOR on February 17, \n2018, denying the allegation at SOR \u00b6 1.i and admitting the allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nThe case was assigned to me on January 30, 2019. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled for February 26, \n2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled.  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10 were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. At the hearing, Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits \n(AE) A through P, which were admitted without objection. The transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived at DOHA on March 6, 2019.  \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a written request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about China or the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). The request and \nthe attached source documents were not admitted into evidence, but were included in \nthe record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I.  \n \nThe request listed supporting documents to show detail and context for those \nfacts. AG \u00b6 6, Foreign Influence, provides, \u201cAdjudication under this Guideline can and \nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d A risk assessment in this case \nnecessitates administrative notice of facts concerning the PRC.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \nApplicant did not object, and I have taken administrative notice of the facts \ncontained in the HE I source documents, and incorporated them by reference. The facts \nare summarized in the written request and will not be repeated in this decision. \nHowever, of particular note, are the following salient facts gleaned from HE 1. \n \nPEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA \n \nThe National Counterintelligence Executive has identified China and Russia as \nthe most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information and technology. China's \nintelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nexploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China, who can use their insider \naccess to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media devices or e-mail. \n \n In assessing the military and security developments in China, the DOD has \nreported that: Chinese actors are the world's most active and persistent perpetrators of \neconomic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and economic \ninformation will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and persistent \nthreat to U.S. economic security. The nature of the cyber threat will evolve with \ncontinuing technological advances in the global information environment. Chinese \nleaders are focused on developing the capabilities they deem necessary to deter or \ndefeat adversary power projection and counter third-party, including U.S., intervention \nduring a crisis or conflict. China's military modernization is producing capabilities that \nhave the potential to reduce core U.S. military technological advantages. \n \nFurther, the DOD found that China very likely uses its intelligence services and \nemploys other illicit approaches that violate U.S. laws and export controls to obtain key \nnational security and export-restricted technologies, controlled equipment, and other \nmaterials unobtainable through other means. China is using its cyber capabilities to \nsupport intelligence collection against the U.S. diplomatic, economic, and defense- \nindustrial base sectors that support U.S. national defense programs. China uses state-\nsponsored industrial and technical espionage to increase the level of technologies and \nexpertise available to support military research, development, and acquisition. \n \nThe organizational network of China's military-industrial complex is such that the \nPeople's Liberation Army (PLA) is able to access sensitive and dual-use technologies or \nknowledgeable experts under the guise of civilian research and development. China has \nin place a long-term, comprehensive military-modernization program designed to \nimprove its armed forces' capacity to fight short-duration, high-intensity regional conflicts \nand, as China's global footprint and international interests grow, its military \nmodernization program has become progressively more focused on investments for a \nrange of missions beyond China's periphery. \n \nIn assessing the national-security implications of the bilateral trade and economic \nrelationship between the U.S. and China, the U.S.-China Economic and Security \nReview Commission has reported: Since at least the mid-2000s, the Chinese \ngovernment has conducted large-scale cyber-espionage against the United States. \nChina has compromised a range of U.S. networks, including those of DoD, defense \ncontractors, and private enterprises. China's material incentives for continuing this \nactivity are immense and unlikely to be altered by small scale U.S. actions. China's \nprogress modernizing its defense industry is due in large part to China's substantial and \nsustained investment in defense research and development (R&D). China's large-scale, \nstate-sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information also has \nallowed China to fill knowledge gaps in its domestic defense and commercial R&D. \n \nWith respect to human rights concerns observed in China, the U.S. Department \nof State reported: The People's Republic of China (PRC) is an authoritarian state in \n\n \n4 \n \n \nwhich the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount authority. CCP members \nhold almost all top government and security apparatus positions. Repression and \ncoercion have markedly increased recently, particularly against organizations and \nindividuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, and public interest and ethnic \nminority issues, and against law firms that took on sensitive cases. \n \nHuman rights concerns that were observed included: extralegal measures to \nprevent public expression of critical opinions; repression of free speech, religion, \nassociation, assembly and movement for certain minorities; extrajudicial killings; \nenforced disappearance and incommunicado detention, including prolonged detentions \nin \"black jails;\" torture and coerced confessions of prisoners; detention and harassment \nof individuals who sought to peacefully exercise their rights under the law; a lack of due \nprocess; searches of premises without warrants; monitoring of communications; \nopening of domestic and international mail; as well as severe restrictions on citizens' \nfreedom of association and free speech.  \n \n  Findings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant is 56 years old. He married in 1994 and divorced in 2011. (Tr. 35) \nApplicant was married previously from 1985 to 1990, and he has two adult children from \nthat marriage. He has been cohabitating for two years with a Chinese national, who \nrecently applied for citizenship in the United States. (Tr. 36) She has a green card. \nApplicant reported some college but no degree. (Tr. 39-40) He served honorably in  the \nU.S. Navy from 1983 to 2004 and attained the rank of Chief Warrant Officer-3 (CWO-3). \nHe had an explosive ordnance disposal specialty rating and earned numerous awards \nincluding three Meritorious Service Medals, several Naval Commendation Medals, and \nNaval Achievement Medals. Applicant held security clearances for most of his career, \nwithout incident. He previously worked as a security specialist (GS-15) for Department \nof Homeland Security (DHS) from 2005 to 2010, and he is now employed by a federal \ncontractor helping to stand up the weapons of mass destruction office for DHS.  \n \nThe SOR alleges delinquent debts totaling $28,537 plus a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition filed in 2014 that was dismissed three months later. The Amended SOR adds \nan allegation of an arrearage to a state division of child support in the approximate \namount of $9,278. However, Applicant denies that alleged arrearage (SOR \u00b6 1.i) and  \nthere is no credible evidence to establish it. His ex-wife furnished an affidavit stating that \nApplicant has timely paid all child support directly to her as required by the divorced \ndecree. No state agency was ever involved. (AE J) The Amended SOR also added a \nGuideline B, foreign influence, allegation at \u00b6 2.a. Applicant admitted most of the \nallegations in his Answer to the SOR and attached documents demonstrating that he \nhas either resolved, or is in the process of resolving, all but two of the alleged debts.  \n \n                                                          \n1 Unless stated otherwise, the source of the information in this section is Applicant\u2019s October 7, 2016, \nsecurity clearance application (SCA) (GE 2). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nApplicant testified credibly that he traveled extensively for his job at DHS and \nrelied on his wife to pay their bills and handle the finances. (Tr. 72) When they started \nhaving marital difficulties, he obtained his credit report in 2009, and realized that he did \nnot recognize many of the delinquent debts reflected. (Tr. 109) He requested validation \nof the debts in accordance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) and \nattempted to settle them at a compromised amount, to no avail. (Tr. 110) It was \napparent that his ex-wife misused a general power or attorney, which Applicant \nprovided to her in his absence, and she ran up exorbitant credit-card debts. (Tr. 112) He \nprocured the services of a credit-repair agency, which was unhelpful. His divorce \nbecame final in 2011.  \n \nApplicant submitted a matrix at his hearing that reflects settlement, or a payment \nplan, for all but two of the alleged debts in the SOR. (AE P) He also provided \ndocumentary substantiation in support of the matrix. SOR \u00b6 1.a, a charged-off debt in \nthe amount of $17,971, was settled for $5,391 on December 18, 2018. (AE B and G) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was a past-due debt to a bank in the amount of $1,161. Originally, Applicant \nwas informed that he was unable to pay on this joint account because his ex-wife had \nincluded it in her Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing in 2013. (Tr. 50, 58) That bankruptcy made \nit extremely difficult for Applicant to access the websites of creditors or negotiate \nsettlements. The past-due amount of $1,154 was paid via check on February 24, 2019. \n(AE N) The account is now current. (Tr. 49-51) All of their accounts were held jointly due \nto the hazardous nature of Applicant\u2019s job. (Tr. 50) \n \nIn July 2018, before the SOR was issued, Applicant hired a second, more \nreputable, credit-counseling agency. (Tr. 59-60) He did not know what some of the \ndelinquencies were for, or whether they had been included in his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy \ncase. SOR \u00b6 1.c was a debt placed for collection by a university in the amount of \n$4,327. Applicant made eight payments of $100 from February 2018 through October \n2018 and the university pulled the delinquency back from its collection agency in 2019. \nIt agreed to accept three payments of $2,300 over 90 days to settle it. Applicant \nprovided documentary evidence that he has made several payments in accordance with \nthat agreement. (AE L, M, O, Tr. 52-54)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d was a charged-off debt by a federal credit union in the amount of \n$3,839. The account was settled via payment in the amount of $1,344 on December 18, \n2018, and the balance is now zero. (AE C and H) SOR \u00b6 1.e was a medical bill placed \nfor collection in the amount of $121. It resulted from an insurance dispute after Applicant \nwas hit by a drunk, uninsured, driver, while Applicant was operating a rental car. \nApplicant testified credibly that his credit-counseling agency, and lawyers, made \nrepeated efforts to contact the creditor and it was unable to locate any account for \nApplicant. Applicant logically believes it was paid by the insurance company or should \nhave been. (Tr. 55-56) Applicant tried to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition pro se in \nSeptember 2014. It was dismissed in December 2014, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, \nbecause he missed a meeting and was unsure how to proceed with the process. (GE 4-\n6) He attempted to resolve the delinquencies run up by his ex-wife on his own.    \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a charged-off account in the amount of $674. Applicant\u2019s \ncredit-counseling agency and law firm contacted the creditor and were unable to obtain \nany account information. I trust that it no longer exists. Applicant used his GI bill \neducation benefits at an out-of-state institution. While he was away, he left virtually \neverything that he owned, including guitars, amplifiers, bikes and shadow boxes \u2013  \nMedals etc. in a storage facility. He fell behind on payments to the storage company, as \na struggling student enduring a divorce, and he received notice that his belongings \nwould be sold at auction due to a past-due amount of $444. (Tr. 63-64) He could not \nattend the auction. He settled this debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.h for $200 on January 25, \n2019, despite that the company auctioned off his property, which had a value greatly \nexceeding the $444 owed.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chinese cohabitant came to the U.S. in 2009 with her deceased \nhusband who was a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 78) She took an exam for U.S. citizenship in \nFebruary 2019. (Tr. 39) They met on the match.com dating website in 2015. (Tr. 74) \nShe works as a massage therapist. (Tr. 93) Applicant testified that she never had any \naffiliation with the Chinese government or intelligence services. She contacts her \nparents in China using the \u201cwe-chat\u201d application a few times each week. Applicant has \nnever met her parents or siblings, and they do not speak English.  (Tr. 84) She visits her \nfamily in China once each year and stays for a month. (Tr. 99) Applicant professes his \nlove for his cohabitant. (Tr. 92)  \n   \nApplicant provided a copy of his impressive resume and two positive character \nreference letters attesting to his integrity, trustworthiness, and reliability. He had \nfinancial counseling first in 2009 with a credit-repair company, and again in 2014. He \nhas acquired no recent delinquent debts, and his financial situation is stable.  \n \n \n \n                                        Policies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(a), the adjudicative process is an examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the individual is an acceptable security risk. This is known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \nnational security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching \nthis decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and \nbased on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing \ninferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential risk of compromise of classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Analysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b618:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance abuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable here:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n \n           (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts alleged in the SOR are confirmed by his credit \nreports (except SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.i), answer to the SOR, and documents submitted at \nthe hearing. The Government produced substantial evidence to support the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.2  \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control . . . , and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances;   \n \n(c) the individual has received, or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors and otherwise resolved debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt, which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.   \n \n \nApplicant endured an expensive divorce and a downturn in the economy. He \nmistakenly relied on his ex-wife to handle the finances while he was overseas, and she \nmisused a general power of attorney that he provided. He pays child support to her \n                                                          \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 22, 2005) (An applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government). \n\n \n9 \n \n \ndirectly in compliance with the terms of their divorce decree. These conditions were \nbeyond his control. He has done everything possible to pay off most of his delinquent \ndebts and enter into repayment plans for others. He documented strict compliance with \nthese repayment plans through a stream of continuous payments to creditors including \nthe university. He has now produced relevant and responsive documentation, \ndemonstrating that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nappropriately engaged a two different credit-counseling services to address his financial \nproblems. He also retained the professional services of a law firm, which effectively \naddressed the allegations in the SOR. He had independent financial counseling. All of \nhis debts alleged in the SOR, have been paid in full or they are in repayment plans. He \nhas met his burden to show that his financial problems are under control, and that his \ndebts were incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. The mitigating \nconditions enumerated above in AG \u00b6 20 apply.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or is associated \nwith a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend was born in China, but came to the United States in 2009 \nand applied for U.S. citizenship recently. He cohabitates with her, and she is in contact \nwith her parents in China. Applicant\u2019s girlfriend creates a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, both directly and through her family members. Applicant bears a very heavy \nburden in mitigating security concerns where a country is hostile to United States \ninterests. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7 (b), and 7(e) are implicated by the evidence. Accordingly, \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with his girlfriend creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \n \n \nConditions that could potentially mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.  \n \nApplicant has demonstrated a long-standing preference for working and living in \nthe U.S. He served in harm\u2019s way in explosive-ordnance disposal in the U.S. Navy for \n22 years. He received numerous awards and decorations for his service. He continued \nto serve U.S. interests as a civilian at DHS with high level clearances in a critical billet \nsupporting national security. Although he admits strong bonds of affection with his \nChinese girlfriend, these bonds are not sufficient to offset or overcome his \ndemonstrated, long-term commitment to the U.S. and self-abnegation in its service \nunder dangerous conditions.3  \n \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and interests. Guideline B \nis not limited to countries hostile to the United States:  \n \n                                                          \n3 The Appeal Board has held that \u201can Applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense of the United States \nis very important and can lead to a favorable result for an Applicant in a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case \n04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. March 20, 2007). \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and \nsafeguarding classified information from any person, organization, or \ncountry that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the \nUnited States.4  \n \n \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the U.S. over \nmatters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially \nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are relevant in assessing whether \nan applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of \ncoercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the U.S., or \nthe foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism.  \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG, Appendix A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG, \nAppendix A, \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline. Applicant has a home and \n                                                          \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \nfamily in the U.S. and he has devoted his professional life to counter-terrorism efforts \nand U.S. national security. \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances and foreign contacts are no longer a security concern. The \nrecord evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline B, \nforeign influence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n          FOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.i:              For Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:                      FOR APPLICANT \n \n           Subparagraph 2.a:                                  For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n                                                 Robert J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR and the amended SOR, Applicant admitted with comments three, and a portion of a fourth, of the factual allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c., and a portion of SOR \u00b6 1.d.).2 Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a field service technician with his current employer since April 2010. A 1985 high school graduate, he received an associate\u2019s degree in 1989. Applicant has never served with the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance, and it is unclear if he ever held a position of public trust. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in 1988. He was remarried in 1991, and divorced in 1994. He married again in 2002.

Eligibility to occupy a public trust position is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 3, 2017, Applicant applied for a public trust position and submitted \nan Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). On October 5, 2018, \nthe Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), for all covered individuals \nwho require initial or continued eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility \nto hold a sensitive position, effective June 8, 2017. \n \nThe SOR alleged trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations), and detailed reasons why the DOD CAF was unable to make an \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \nto grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for occupying a public trust position to support a contract \nwith the DOD. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether such eligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on September 11, 2018. In a sworn statement, dated \nNovember 2, 2018, supplemented by an e-mail, dated November 9, 2018, Applicant \nresponded to the SOR and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December \n20, 2018. The case was assigned to me on January 10, 2019. A Notice of Hearing was \nissued on March 13, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 2, 2019. \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Government exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 4, and Applicant \nexhibits (AE) A through AE I were admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant \ntestified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on April 11, 2019. I kept the record open to \nenable Applicant to supplement it. He took advantage of that opportunity                    \nand timely submitted additional documents which were marked and admitted into \nevidence as AE J through AE V without objection. The record closed on May 2, 2019. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to conform to \nthe evidence presented. The motion was to amend SOR by adding two new allegations: \n\u201c1.c. \u2013 You failed to timely file, as required, your federal income tax returns for tax years \n2012 and 2013; and 1.d. \u2013 You failed to timely file, as required, your federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2016 and 2017.\u201d The motion was granted without objection.1 \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR and the amended SOR, Applicant admitted with \ncomments three, and a portion of a fourth, of the factual allegations in the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.c., and a portion of SOR \u00b6 1.d.).2  Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments \nare incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a field service technician with his current employer since April 2010. A 1985 high \nschool graduate, he received an associate\u2019s degree in 1989. Applicant has never served \nwith the U.S. military. He has never held a security clearance, and it is unclear if he ever \nheld a position of public trust. Applicant was married in 1987, and divorced in 1988. He \nwas remarried in 1991, and divorced in 1994. He married again in 2002. He has four \nchildren, born in 1987, 1993, 2003, and 2007. \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 35-37. \n \n2 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, dated November 2, 2018; AE P (E-mail, dated May 1, 2019). \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \nFinancial Considerations3 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties first arose in 2000, and they continued over a multi-\nyear period, essentially because he was withholding too little from his federal and state \nincome for tax purposes. As a result, over the years, a substantial number of federal and \nstate tax liens were filed against him for various amounts, with some as small as $50, and \none as large as $34,501.4 It took Applicant approximately one decade to resolve the state \nincome tax issues, and a number of them were released in 2014, 2015, and 2016. He \nhad a repayment plan with the state, and by paying the state approximately $9,800, the \nstate tax liens were eventually released. During the intervening period, a son was born in \n2003 with temporary health issues, and then he developed other conditions, including \nAttention Deficit Disorder, Learning Disability, Hyperactivity, Autism, and Epilepsy.5 The \nmedical expenses caused by those issues were approximately $8,000 per year.  \n \nBecause Applicant also had similar issues with respect to his federal income taxes \ninvolving the payment of insufficient income taxes, and the imposition of increasing \ninterest, essentially during the period 2000 through 2009, in January 2009, he sought the \nassistance of a company specializing in obtaining tax relief, and agreed to pay them \n$344.44 for the draft modification request form, plus a $25 fee. Based on the figures \npresented to the company, an offer in compromise analysis was prepared.6 It is unclear \nif it was rejected by the IRS or even submitted to the IRS. Nevertheless, federal tax liens \n                                                          \n3 General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can be found in the \nfollowing exhibits: GE 2 (e-QIP, dated November 3, 2017); GE 3 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated March \n18, 2018); GE 4 (Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated December 2, 2017); \nAE A (Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Account Transcript \u2013 2009, dated March 21, 2019); AE B (IRS \nAccount Transcript \u2013 2010, dated March 21, 2019); AE C (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2011, dated March 21, \n2019); AE D (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2012, dated March 21, 2019); AE E (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2013, \ndated March 21, 2019); AE F (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2014, dated March 21, 2019); AE G (IRS Account \nTranscript \u2013 2015, dated March 21, 2019); AE N (Amended Individual Income Tax Return \u2013 2016 (Form \n1040X), dated April 1, 2019); AE N (Individual Income Tax Return \u2013 2016 (Form 1040), dated April 1, 2019); \nAE U (Individual Income Tax Return \u2013 2017 (Form 1040), dated April 1, 2019); AE R (IRS Account \nTranscript \u2013 2002, dated April 24, 2019); and Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2; and AE P, supra \nnote 2.  \n \n4 Tr. at 22; GE 4, supra note 3, at 5-6.

I have paid some toward the \noriginal debt though not much due to household (sic) bills and obligations.\u201d8 While there \nare some tax very recent post-SOR and post-Notice of Hearing payments to the IRS: \n$611.87 and $131.77 of the unpaid 2011 tax balance of $744.28 on March 21, 2019, and \nApril 10, 2019, when a total of $611.87 was paid, or tax refunds applied by the IRS, and \nApplicant contends that the federal tax liens are no longer listed on his credit report,9 \nthere is no evidence that those federal tax liens have been released.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s federal income tax issues were not limited to simply failing to pay his \nincome taxes over the years. He also had a substantial history of failing to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns over a multi-year period, something he referred to as \u201ca \nmistake.\u201d10 For example, while it was not alleged in the SOR, Applicant failed to timely file \nhis federal income tax return for the tax year 2002, and as of April 24, 2019, only a \nsubstitute tax return was prepared by the IRS.11 Applicant also failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for: the tax year 2012, until August 3, 2015;12 the tax year \n2013, until May 25, 2015;13 the tax year 2016, until April 1, 2019,14 although Applicant \n                                                          \n7 GE 4, supra note 3, at 6. \n \n8 Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR, supra note 2. \n \n9 Tr. at 16, 28; AE T (Recent Payments, undated); AE H (Extract of Experian Credit Report, dated \nApril 2, 2019); AE C, supra note 3. \n \n             10 Tr. at 29. The legal requirement to file a federal income tax return is based upon an individual\u2019s \ngross income and other enumerated conditions. Once it is determined that there is an obligation to so file, \nthe following applies: \n \nAny person required under this title to pay any estimated tax or tax, or required by this title \nor by regulations made under authority thereof to make a return, keep any records, or \nsupply any information, who willfully fails to pay such estimated tax or tax, make such \nreturn, keep such records, or supply such information, at the time or times required by law \nor regulations, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a \nmisdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than $25,000 \n($100,000 in the case of a corporation), or imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both, \ntogether with the costs of prosecution. In the case of any person with respect to whom \nthere is a failure to pay any estimated tax, this section shall not apply to such person with \nrespect to such failure if there is no addition to tax under section 6654 or 6655 with respect \nto such failure. In the case of a willful violation of any provision of section 6050I, the first \nsentence of this section shall be applied by substituting \"felony\" for \"misdemeanor\" and \"5 \nyears\" for \"1 year.\" \n  \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, Willful failure to file return, supply information, or pay tax. \n \n11 AE R (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2002, dated April 24, 2019). \n \n12 AE D (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2012, dated May 21, 2019); AE P, supra note 2. \n \n13 AE E (IRS Account Transcript \u2013 2013, dated March 21, 2019); AE P, supra note 2. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nclaimed it was initially filed timely, but not properly recorded;15 and the tax year 2017, until \nApril 1, 2019.16  \nApplicant\u2019s reported adjusted gross income in 2014 was $70,227; in 2015, \n$79,180; in 2016, $78,332; and in 2017, $75,979. Applicant submitted two slightly \ndifferent Personal Financial Statements, both dated May 1, 2019, to reflect his $3,459.97 \n(versus $3,173.71) net monthly income; $1,644 (versus $1,814) in monthly expenses; \nand a purported $1,082.64 (versus $1,082.64), not including any payments to satisfy \nfederal tax liens or for unpaid income taxes; leaving a remainder of $733.33 (versus \n$197.07) that might be available for discretionary spending or savings.17 Both of \nApplicant\u2019s Personal Financial Statements reflect that he has stocks and pensions worth \n$100,000, a mobile home, a boat, a truck, and a luxury automobile. \nApplicant\u2019s only effort of obtain financial counseling appears to be his post-hearing \nacquisition of a book, Total Money Makeover, by Dave Ramsey, a national radio host \ndealing primarily with financial issues.18 Applicant did not explain what corrective actions \nhe has taken over an extensive period to avoid the pitfalls or other factors that he identified \nas the ones that caused him financial difficulties. He offered only generalized explanations \nfor his failures to routinely timely file his federal income tax returns; to make more timely \nefforts to pay his unpaid federal income taxes; and to resolve his federal tax liens. While \nhe apparently has a monthly remainder of either $733.33 or $197.07, depending on which \nversion of his Personal Financial Statement is accurate, there is a paucity of evidence to \nindicate that Applicant\u2019s financial situation is now under control.  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d19 As Commander in Chief, the President \nhas the authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained \nin the Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.20  \n                                                          \n14 AE N (U.S. Individual Income Tax Return (Form 1040) \u2013 2016, dated April 1, 2019); AE P, supra \nnote 2. \n \n15 AE P, supra note 2. \n \n16 AE U (Form 1040 2017, dated April 1, 2019); AE P, supra note 2. \n \n17 AE L (Personal Financial Statement, dated May 1, 2019); AE Q (Personal Financial Statement, \ndated May 1, 2019). \n \n18 AE V (E-mail, dated May 9, 2019). \n \n19 Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \n \n20 It should be noted that a memorandum from the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for \nCounterintelligence and Security, Adjudication of Trustworthiness Cases, dated November 19, 2004, \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \n \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common \nsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d21 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nhas the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation \nor mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government.22  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information.  Furthermore, security clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.23 In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n                                                          \ncovers the handling of trustworthiness cases under the Directive. The memorandum directed the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) to continue to utilize the Directive in ADP contractor cases for \ntrustworthiness determinations. \n \n21 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla \nbut less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n22 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n23 Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \n      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b619:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income      \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for a multi-year period \n(tax years 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017, as well as the unalleged 2002); failed to pay \nannual federal income taxes as required for a multi-year period; had $42,034 in federal \ntax liens filed against him in 2009; and he may still owe the IRS unpaid federal income \ntaxes, interest, and penalties. The failure to timely file income tax returns has \ntrustworthiness implications because:24 \n                                                          \n \n24 ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR Case \nNo. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002)); \nISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \n\n8 \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance [and by inference, a trustworthiness] \nadjudication is not directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it\ndirected toward inducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a\nproceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id.\nA person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not\ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of\nthose granted access to classified [and by inference, sensitive] information.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See\nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173,\n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).\nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has \npurportedly corrected [his or her] federal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof [a]pplicant\u2019s security worthiness [or trustworthiness] in light of [his or her] longstanding \nprior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d including a failure to timely file federal income \ntax returns.25 Furthermore, since a public trust position represents an obligation to the \nfederal government for the protection of sensitive information, a failure to honor other \nobligations to the government has a direct bearing on an applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information.26 In this instance, while \nApplicant may have eventually filed his late federal income tax returns, and he may now \nbe properly motivated, he generally waited for extensive periods after the due dates for \nthe filings, and, with respect to the federal tax returns for the tax years 2016 and 2017, \nuntil April 2019, approximately six months after the SOR was issued. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f) have been established. As there is no evidence that Applicant was unwilling to \nsatisfy his unpaid federal income taxes or federal tax liens regardless of the ability to do \nso, AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n25 See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, \nno foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis \nas inadequate to support approval of access to classified information, and by inference sensitive \ninformation, with focus on timing of filing of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \n26 See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). \n\n9 \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;27\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;\n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;28\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented\nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions\nto resolve the issue; and\n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority\nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those\narrangements.\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) minimally apply, but none of the remaining mitigating \nconditions apply. The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing financial \nissues make it difficult to conclude that it \u201cwas so infrequent,\u201d or that it is \u201cunlikely to recur.\u201d \n27 A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed \nas recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \n28 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must \npresent evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some \nother good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not \ndefine the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, \nhonesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more than \nmerely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as bankruptcy [or \nstatute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR-related financial difficulties first arose in 2000 and continued through \n2009 when he failed to withhold sufficient income for his federal income taxes. That led \nto two federal tax liens being filed against him in 2009. However, that was only one aspect \nof his federal income tax problems, for he also failed to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns for a multi-year period. While Applicant generally attributed his financial difficulties \nto health issues and the failure to withhold the necessary income, in the absence of more \ncomplete explanations and some documentation to support his contentions, neither of \nthose factors was due to conditions that were largely beyond his control. Federal (and \nstate) personal income taxes went unpaid, and while the state issues were apparently \nresolved in 2009, Applicant never obtained an installment agreement with respect to his \ndelinquent federal income taxes, and he offered no documentation to indicate that the \nfederal tax liens have been released.  \n \nIt is difficult to conclude that Applicant made substantial timely good-faith efforts to \nresolve his unpaid federal income taxes, despite periods of having reasonably good \nincome. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal income tax returns over \na multi-year period is of considerable concern, because while an individual may have \ninsufficient funds to pay his or her taxes, that is not an acceptable justification for not \ntimely filing federal income tax returns.  \n \nThe Appeal Board previously observed that:29 \n \n[t]he mere filing of delinquent tax returns or the existence of a payment \narrangement with an appropriate tax authority does not compel a Judge to \nissue a favorable decision. As with the application of any mitigating \ncondition, the Judge must examine the record evidence and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. \nThe timing of corrective action is an appropriate factor for the Judge to \nconsider in the application of [pertinent mitigating conditions]. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his trustworthiness eligibility is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests.30 Applicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the \ncircumstances cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.31 \nTrustworthiness decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines \ndo not require an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the \n                                                          \n29 ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018) (quoting ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-\n4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018). \n \n30 See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \n \n31 See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \nSOR. An applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such \ndebts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time.  \n \nMere promises to pay debts and timely file income tax returns in the future, \nespecially after multi-year delays in taking timely actions, without further confirmed \nactions, are insufficient. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s evidence of self-reformation and self-\nrehabilitation to voluntarily comply with the tax filing requirements in the future fail to \nremove the lingering doubts that remain whether he has demonstrated the judgment, \nreliability, and willingness to abide by well-established rules and regulations that is \nrequired for granting eligibility for a position of public trust.32 \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis.33  \n  \nThere is some evidence mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant is a 52-year-old \nemployee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a field service technician with \nhis current employer since April 2010. A 1985 high school graduate, he received an \nassociate\u2019s degree in 1989. Although Applicant failed to pay sufficient state income taxes \nover a multi-year period from 2000 until 2009, and state tax liens were filed against him, \n                                                          \n32 See ISCR Case No. 17-01256, supra note 29, at 5. \n \n33 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-\n3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \n \n\n12 \nhe took decisive action with respect to his state income tax issues, and by 2009 or 2010, \nhe paid off his delinquent state income taxes. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant also has had a long-standing problem with his federal income taxes, having \nfailed to withhold sufficient funds to cover his federal income taxes over a multi-year \nperiod. Those failures resulted in the IRS filing two federal tax liens against him in 2009, \ntotaling $42,034. While there are some very recent post-SOR and post-Notice of Hearing \npayments to the IRS on March 21, 2019, and April 10, 2019, and Applicant contends that \nthe federal tax liens are no longer listed on his credit report, there is no evidence that \nthose federal tax liens have been released. Accordingly, he may still owe the IRS unpaid \nfederal income taxes, interest, and penalties. However, of greater significance is \nApplicant\u2019s seemingly routine practice of failing to timely file his federal income tax \nreturns. While Applicant offered some explanations for his untimely actions, those \nexplanations do not adequately justify the lengthy delays in completing the required \nactions. Considering all of the above, I am unable to reach a positive conclusion pertaining \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating:34 \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d necessarily includes evidence of actual \ndebt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is not \nrequired, as a matter of law, to establish that he [or she] has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he [or she] has \u201c. . . established a plan to resolve his [or \nher] financial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u201d \nThe Judge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his [or her] actions in evaluating the extent to which that \napplicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible \nand realistic. See Directive \u00b6 E2.2(a) (\u201cAvailable, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u201d) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, \na reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment \nof such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first \ndebts actually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones \nlisted in the SOR. \nApplicant has demonstrated a fair track record of debt reduction and elimination \nefforts, taking a decade to reduce or eliminate most of his unpaid income taxes. As for \nhis routine history of failing to timely file his federal income tax returns, he has \ndemonstrated a poor track record. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial \n34 ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \n\n \n13 \n                                      \n \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a position of public \ntrust. For all of these reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from his financial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \n\u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust to support a contract with the DOD.

Eligibility for access to public trust position is denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \n Statement of the Case \n \n \nOn May 5, 2014, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). On \nJuly 19, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), detailing trustworthiness \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, \n2017.    \n \n \n \nOn October 10, 2018, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On February 28, 2019, the case was assigned \n\n \n2 \n \n \nto me. On March 4, 2019, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nnotice of Hearing, setting the hearing for March 19, 2019.  \n \n \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 3 into evidence, which I admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and \noffered eight documents, Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H into evidence, which I \nadmitted without objection. At the request of Applicant, I held the record open for one \nmonth to submit additional documentation. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non April 1, 2019. On April 17, 2019, Applicant provided copies of six letters she mailed \nto her creditors. On May 20, 2019, Applicant provided an e-mail summary of the status \nof six SOR accounts, and her plans to start making payments to four of the creditors \nbeginning June 1, 2019. She did not provide any substantiating documents with her e-\nmail. The record was closed on May 23, 2019.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Procedural Matters \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel requested SOR \u00b6 1.b be withdrawn since the alleged \ndelinquent account was not Applicant\u2019s account. She had only been listed as an \nauthorized user on the account. I granted the request, and SOR \u00b6 1.b was withdrawn for \ngood cause. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nHaving thoroughly considered the evidence in the record, including Applicant's \nadmissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old. She is \ncurrently married and has four children, ages 4, 6, 7 and 17. The youngest two children \nreceive Social Security disability of approximately $1,500 per month. Her spouse is \nattending college full-time using the benefits of his GI Bill, which pays for his tuition in \nfull. He also receives a monthly stipend of about $750 from the GI Bill. He is not \ncurrently employed. Applicant is also enrolled in an on-line college class, which is partly \npaid by grants, and partly paid through student loans. She was unemployed from April \n2013 to August 2015. She was employed for a brief time from August 2015 to \nSeptember 2015, and then the family moved to another state. She remained \nunemployed until December 2016, when she started employment with her current \nemployer. She is a customer service employee for their call center. This is her first \napplication for a public trust position. (Tr. 26-32, 36-38; AE 2) \n \nApplicant stated that she got into financial trouble due to her husband being \nunemployed, her periods of unemployment, and after she was involved in a car accident \nin May 2014. She often missed work due to constant headaches and pain. She \nexhausted all of her sick leave and vacation time. She was not covered by car \ninsurance at the time of the accident, and she claimed the other driver was at fault. The \nother driver is suing her for damages, and Applicant\u2019s lawyer is suing the other driver for \nher injuries and damages. This civil case is currently pending litigation. (Tr. 32-34) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a delinquent car loan account in the amount of about $11,789. \nApplicant admitted this account in her response to the SOR. She said it was a joint \naccount for her husband\u2019s car, which they were unable to pay after he lost his job. This \naccount became delinquent in 2017. The car is still in their possession, and this account \nremains delinquent. Applicant has not made payments on the account, or contacted the \ncreditor, but she hired Lexington Law, a for-profit consumer financial repair company, in \nabout November 2018 to contact this creditor and request a settlement offer. This debt \nhas not been resolved. (Tr. 35-36, 47-48; GE 2)    \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b was withdrawn. (Tr. 39) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a financial credit union account charged off in the amount of \n$1,500. Applicant admitted this account in her response to the SOR. She said this debt \nwas the result of a job lost in 2013. At the hearing, she stated Lexington Law had this \naccount removed from her credit report. She acknowledged that this was her debt, and \nshe had not contacted the creditor or made any payments since she expected \nLexington Law would communicate with the creditor about settling the debt. She was \nasked if she thought Lexington Law would contact the creditor after the account had \nbeen removed from her credit report. Applicant did not believe Lexington Law would \ntake further action. Applicant planned to send out letters to her creditors in about four \nmonths. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 39-40) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges an apartment lease account referred for collection in the \namount of $1,343. Applicant admitted this account in her response to the SOR. She \nsaid it was a result of her husband losing his job in 2011. This account became \ndelinquent in 2012. At the hearing, Applicant claimed that she had not renewed her \nlease, and the apartment complex never provided her documentation with details why a \nbalance was owed. She was not completely certain if this account had been removed \nfrom her credit report by Lexington Law. She acknowledged that she was preparing \nletters for multiple creditors to see if the debt could be settled or paid. She expected to \nprepare these letters, or make phone calls to creditors, within the next four months. This \ndebt is unresolved. (Tr. 40-42, 45, 53-54; GE 3) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a delinquent cable bill in the amount of $1,151. Applicant \ndenied this account in her response to the SOR, but at the hearing she admitted \nresponsibility for this account. This account is no longer on her credit report, but she will \nprepare a letter to the creditor to see if the debt could be settled or paid. This debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 42-43)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a delinquent cell phone account in the amount of $772. \nApplicant admitted this account in her response to the SOR, and listed that the debt is \ndue to her losing her job at this cell phone company in 2013. At the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted this debt remained delinquent. She planned to prepare a letter to this creditor \nto determine her payment options within the next four months. This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 43)  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, and 1.o allege unpaid medical accounts referred for \ncollection in the total amount of $1,213. Applicant denied all of these medical accounts \nin her response to the SOR. At the hearing, she said she always carried medical \ninsurance. With so many bills, she explained that she was not certain what medical \nservices, or medical providers, did not obtain payment from her insurance. Some, if not \nall, of the medical accounts had been removed from her credit report with the help of \nLexington Law. Applicant claimed that she had not received any bills or statements for \nany of these medical accounts. She planned to do research, and contact collection \ncompanies in an effort to determine the original creditor. Then, within the next four \nmonths, she would start sending out letters, or make phone calls, to these creditors to \ndetermine payment options. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 43-45) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a delinquent account referred for collection in the amount of \n$8,534. Applicant denied this account in her response to the SOR, and listed that the \ndebt was disputed and removed. This account became delinquent in 2013. At the \nhearing, she stated this debt is similar to the other apartment leasing complex debt. \nApplicant disputed this debt because she claimed they were no longer under a lease at \nthe time they moved. This debt has been removed from her credit report. She had a \nletter at home showing that she was no longer responsible for this debt. Department \nCounsel requested documentation from Applicant to verify that this account was settled. \nApplicant stated she could provide the letter. Applicant failed to provide substantiating \ndocumentation while the record was held open. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 46-47, 53-\n54) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.j alleges a delinquent internet and TV utility account referred for \ncollection in the amount of $857. Applicant admitted this account in her response to the \nSOR, and listed that the debt is due to her losing her job in 2013. At the hearing she \nstated this is a creditor she planned to contact within the next four months to determine \nher payment options. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 47) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k alleges a delinquent account referred by an insurance company in the \namount of $455. Applicant denied this account in her response to the SOR. This \naccount became delinquent in 2012. She listed this account was paid once she started \ninsurance coverage with the company recently. Applicant failed to provide \nsubstantiating documentation. This debt is unresolved. (GE 3) \n  \nApplicant nets approximately $4,410 per month, to include her income, the Social \nSecurity disability payment, her spouse\u2019s GI Bill monthly stipend, and his Veterans \nAdministration disability payment. She said the majority of their income goes to their \nutility bills. They are monitoring their utilities and they have also watched their \nentertainment expenses, by eating in more and not going to the movies as often. They \nhave not been able to start a savings account. Lexington Law does offer financial \ncounseling and advice on how to manage a budget. (Tr. 48-51, 54) \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor submitted a character reference letter. He found Applicant \nto be a valuable part of the organization since she was hired in December 2016. She \n\n \n5 \n \n \ntakes her job seriously and does everything in her power to uphold the security \nstandards. (AE A) \nPolicies \n \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may \nbe made. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable.  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR.1 Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.2 An applicant \nhas the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never \nshifts to the Government.3 An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to \nsensitive information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n1 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n \n2 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n  \n The guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. Applicant\u2019s 14 delinquent debts total approximately $29,000. These \ndebts became delinquent between 2012 and 2017, and they remain delinquent. The \nGovernment produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 \n19(a) (an inability to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Further inquiry about the applicability of mitigating conditions is required. \n \n Conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending \npractices, or identity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control; \nand \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n Applicant bears the burdens of production and persuasion in mitigation. Her debts \nbecame delinquent between 2012 and 2017, and they remain delinquent. She has \nreferenced financial hardships due to periods of unemployment for her and her spouse, \nand medical complications she received from a car accident in 2014; however, she has \nnot provided sufficient information or documentation to establish the financial impact of \nthese conditions beyond her control. More important, she must demonstrate that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant has not provided any \ndocumentary evidence of a debt-resolution plan she has established with her creditors, \nevidence of systematic payments in accordance with the plan, or even a receipt or letter \nshowing she is no longer responsible for a specific account. She joined a consumer \ncredit repair company in November 2018, after receipt of the SOR. This company will \ndispute all of a consumer\u2019s reported debts, and perhaps have some of those delinquent \naccounts removed from the credit report, but this does not show any good-faith effort \nthat an individual responsible for the account is working dutifully to resolve their \ndelinquent debt. She recently sent an e-mail indicating that she will start making \npayments to four of her delinquent creditors next month. None of the financial \nconsiderations mitigating conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n  Whole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a trustworthiness determination by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \ntrustworthiness determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant\u2019s financial problems have persisted \nfor several years, and there is no evidence that these problems are being addressed, \nbeing resolved, and are unlikely to recur. Even if Applicant experienced circumstances \nbeyond her control that negatively impacted her finances, she must demonstrate that \n\n \n8 \n \n \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances. After evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations trustworthiness concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c-1.o: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Cervi, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant substantially mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 5, 2016, \nrequesting renewal of a Department of Defense (DOD) security clearance. On August 17, \n2018, the DOD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Applicant responded to the SOR on September 19, 2018, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge.1  \nThe case was assigned to me on November 14, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 13, 2018, \n1 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n2 \n \nscheduling the hearing for January 4, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified. In post-hearing submissions, Applicant submitted several documents \nmarked together as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, that were admitted without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old aircraft test engineer, employed by a government \ncontractor since 2008. He previously operated a fencing business from early 2017, but it \nfailed in September 2017. He graduated from high school in 1992, and has completed \nsome college. He married in 2000 and has three children ages 17 to 21. He was \npreviously married for a short time in 1995. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps \non active duty from 1997 to 2002, and in the Marine Corps Reserve from 2002 to 2005. \nHe deployed to Iraq in 2003 and 2004 during Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \nEnduring Freedom. While in the Marine Corps, he held a security clearance without \nincident. He currently holds a security clearance, granted in 2012, after being previously \ndenied in 2010 by a DOHA Administrative Judge in an administrative determination. \n \n \nThe SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts, including three vehicle debts and several \nsmaller consumer and medical debts. Applicant admitted all of the debts, and provided \nexplanations with his answers.  \n \n \nApplicant first fell into debt when he left the Marine Corps and had difficulty finding \ncivilian employment. In 2010, his security clearance was denied. He testified that he \nregained his clearance in 2012. However, from 2012 to 2013, Applicant\u2019s spouse suffered \nfrom a medical condition that required her to undergo two neck surgeries. She lost her \njob as a manager in 2012, and has not been able to return to work. In 2017, Applicant \nstarted a fencing business and worked nights for his government contractor employer. \nThe fencing business failed by September 2017. Applicant accumulated debts that he \nwas unable to satisfy, including a loan on a vehicle that was repossessed, and loans on \nvehicles for his spouse and daughter. \n \n \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a delinquent vehicle loan account for $31,296 from October 2017. \nApplicant owes $14,854 after the vehicle was repossessed and sold, and the debt has \nbeen charged off with no indication that the debt is being actively collected. Applicant \nnotes that this was a vehicle used in his failed business. The debt has not been resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a delinquent vehicle loan account for $12,828 from September 2017. \nThe vehicle was repossessed due to Applicant\u2019s failed business, and was sold. The \nresulting debt of $6,067 was settled by Applicant for $1,516 and paid. The debt is \nresolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a delinquent vehicle loan account for $9,478 from September 2015. \nThe vehicle was repossessed due to Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s medical condition and inability \n\n \n3 \n \nto work. The debt was charged off in 2017, and there is no indication that the debt is being \nactively collected. The debt has not been resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d is a delinquent telephone account for $2,076. Applicant disputed the \ndebt but eventually agreed to a settlement of $1,250 and paid it. The debt is resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a short-term loan for $1,593. Applicant has been paying on the debt, \nwhich was reduced to $956. The current status of the debt is unclear. The debt has not \nbeen fully resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a collection by a bank for $885. Applicant closed the account, but \nbelieves the bank continued to charge fees. Applicant testified that the debt was resolved \nthrough the use of a debt-relief company. The debt appears to be resolved. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g is a cable company debt for $882. Applicant disputed the account and \nthere have been no further collection efforts. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h \u2013 1.j are 2017 medical collection accounts that were resolved in late \n2017 and removed from his current credit report. The accounts have been resolved. \n \n \nApplicant has been utilizing a debt-relief company since June 2018, but they show \nlittle results for the $638 per month he was paying. After the hearing, Applicant discharged \nthe company and began to settle accounts on his own. In addition to those already paid, \nhe also settled and paid a bank card account that was not listed on the SOR. \n \n \nApplicant completed a budgeting class offered by the county in February 2019. He \nprovided a letter of recommendation from his employment team lead, attesting to his \ndependability and dedication to accomplishing the mission. He is described as an \n\u201cimpressive problem solver\u201d and an essential contributor to the team\u2019s success. Applicant \nnoted that he received four special recognition awards and two spot awards. He noted \nthe efforts he has made since his hearing, to settle debts. He is able to meet all of his \nmonthly expenses, and will start saving about $3,100 per month after his debts are fully \nresolved. He has access to a loan from his 401k retirement account if necessary to \nresolve debts. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n\n \n4 \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n \nAnalysis \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts following the loss of his spouse\u2019s full-time \nincome as a manager due to a medical condition, and his failed fencing business in 2017. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n (b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nApplicant suffered from economic conditions that were outside of his control. His \nspouse\u2019s loss of income and his failed business resulted in significant financial obligations \nthat he was unable to meet, despite his continued work at night for his government \ncontractor employer. Six of the ten SOR debts have been satisfied, and one other debt \nnot on the SOR was paid. Applicant had three vehicles repossessed. Two vehicle loan \naccounts were charged off and do not appear to be in collection status, and the third debt \nwas settled and paid. He also paid three medical debts, a bank fee debt, and a credit card \ndebt.  \n \n \nApplicant has taken responsible action to gain control over his finances. He \nretained the services of a debt-relief company, but the company did not show sufficient \nprogress for the money he was paying. He also completed a budgeting course, and has \nsufficient income to meet his current financial obligations. I believe Applicant\u2019s financial \nmanagement has significantly improved and his finances are now under control. Although \nhe continues to carry some delinquent debt, he has begun the process of resolving his \nremaining debts when able. I believe that Applicant will continue his efforts to \nexpeditiously resolve the remaining delinquent accounts, and will refrain from further \ndelinquencies. Given his continued efforts to quickly resolve the remaining debts, I find \n\n \n6 \n \nthat Applicant\u2019s past financial issues no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) - (d) are applicable. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I considered Applicant\u2019s testimony, documents \nprovided after the hearing, his financial challenges, and his military service. Applicant has \nshown current financial responsibility and appears to have control of his finances. He is \nable to meet family financial obligations while continuing to resolve the remaining debts. \nHe has shown the qualities of financial responsibility that is expected of clearance \nholders, and I am convinced that he has shown good-faith efforts to resolve his debts.  \n \nThis clearance decision presumes Applicant will continue to progress toward \nexpeditiously resolving his remaining outstanding collections, and to refrain from any \nadditional delinquencies. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a conditional security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant has substantially mitigated the financial considerations security concerns and \nwill continue to do so.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nGregg A.

Nagel, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGOLDSTEIN, Jennifer I., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. He failed to provide sufficient documentation to establish \nmitigation with respect to his consumer debts and failure to file Federal tax returns. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 16, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016), implemented June 8, 2017.  \n01/16/2019\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on August 9, 2018, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted \nits file of relevant material (FORM) on August 28, 2018. Applicant received it on \nSeptember 19, 2018. The Government\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 6. The \nFORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit material \nin refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. \nApplicant submitted no response to the FORM within the time period allotted. Items 1 \nthrough 6 are admitted into the record. The case was assigned to me on January 8, 2019.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 46 years old and divorced. He has been employed by a government \ncontractor since March 2017. He worked as a driver for a ride-sharing service from \nNovember 2016 to March 2017. He was unemployed from April 2016 to November 2016, \nafter he was \u201cdismissed for absences\u201d from a position with another government contractor \nthat he held from August 2016 to October 2016. He was also terminated from a position \nhe held from September 2015 to April 2016, following \u201cmissing time due to health \nissue[s].\u201d He was employed from November 2011 to September 2015 by another \ncontractor. He was unemployed from November 2010 to October 2011 after being laid off \nfrom a position he had held since 1998. (Item 2.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted to nine creditors in the total amount of $26,196 as listed in \nthe SOR. He also failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for 2013 to 2016. \nApplicant attributed these debts and his failure to file his tax returns to his divorce. He \nstated in his security clearance application, \u201cAfter my ex-wife moved out and we got \ndivorced, it became increasingly difficult to keep up with bills and the[re] was no money \navailable to pay the tax.\u201d Applicant indicated that he hired a law group to \u201cdiscuss strategy \nfor paying back the IRS, debt consolidation and the possibility of filing Bankruptcy.\u201d He \nprovided nothing further in this regard. (Item 2.) His debts are as follows. \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off automotive loan in the amount of $10,977, \nas stated in SOR \u00b6 1.a. This debt has been delinquent since at least May 2014. (Item 5; \nItem 6.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $6,059, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. This debt has been delinquent since at least 2013. (Item 5; Item 6.)  \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a charged-off account in the amount of $4,209, as stated \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c. This debt was for a credit card account. It has been delinquent since 2013. \n(Item 5; Item 6.)  \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $1,016, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. This debt has been delinquent since at least 2016. (Item 5; Item 6.) \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $621, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.e. It has been delinquent since 2013. (Item 5; Item 6.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $584, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f. It has been delinquent since 2011. (Item 5; Item 6.) \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $362, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. This debt was for a storage unit. It became delinquent in 2017. (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $1,342, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. This debt became delinquent in 2017. (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant is indebted on a collection account in the amount of $1,026, as stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.i. This debt became delinquent in 2017. (Item 4.) \n \n \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2013 \nthrough 2016, as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.k.  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged his debt and indicated he was trying to resolve it. He \nstated: \n \nAs pertaining to the financial questions earlier, I would just like to state that \nthese issues came about after my divorce as I was trying to maintain my \nliving situation. The losing of my jobs at both [government contractors], as \ndiscussed earlier did not help this situation. Since then I have cut my \nmonthly bills down to almost nothing and I am actively pursuing cleaning up \nthe situation. I am currently working with the [law group] on these matters, \nand will have the situation resolved in the coming months. It was never the \ngoal to not pay or defraud any financial institution, it was simply being over \nextended at the time. (Item 2.) \n \nDespite Applicant\u2019s claim that he was working with the law group to resolve his \ndebts, he failed to provide any documentation to support his claim or show that he was \notherwise working to resolve his delinquent accounts. He produced no evidence of filing \nhis state or Federal tax returns from 2013 to 2016.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n\n \n4 \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nFinally, Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern under the financial considerations guideline is set out in AG \n& 18:  \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \n\n \n5 \n \n \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n \n \nApplicant has over $26,196 in delinquent debt, which became delinquent between \n2011 and 2017. He failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2013 through 2016. He has insufficient income to address these liabilities. There is \nsufficient evidence to establish disqualification under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nare potentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \n \nApplicant has insufficient income to meet all of his financial obligations. There is \nno evidence that he will be able to avoid delinquent accounts in the future. He remains \nindebted on consumer loans and has not provided evidence of filing his delinquent tax \nreturns. His debt is ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to unemployment and his divorce. \nThese are circumstances beyond his control. However, he has failed to meaningfully \naddress his delinquent accounts. The record lacks documentation to show he reasonably \nand responsibly addressed his delinquencies. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully \nestablished.  \n \n \nApplicant provided no documentation of financial counseling. There is no evidence \nto conclude that his financial problems are under control. He indicated he enlisted the \nhelp of a law group, but there is no documentation to show whether any of his debts were \naddressed or his delinquent tax returns were filed. The evidence does not establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) or 20(d).  \n \n \nApplicant did not claim to dispute any of his alleged delinquencies. He admitted all \nof the allegations on the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \n \n \nApplicant failed to resolve his delinquent Federal and state tax returns. AG \u00b6 20(g) \ndoes not mitigate the security concern. \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited with his \nefforts to enlist the help of a law group to resolve his debts and file his delinquent tax \nreturns. However, he failed to support his statements with proof of concomitant action. \nHe may be eligible for national security eligibility in the future if he is able to document \nreasonable and responsible actions toward resolving his outstanding Federal and state \ntax returns and maintain solvency. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

Foreman, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n______________ \nDecision \n______________ \nGregg A. Cervi, Administrative Judge \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline G (Alcohol \nConsumption). Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA)1 on May 12, 2016. On \nAugust 10, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a statement of reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nG.2 Applicant answered the SOR on August 31, 2018, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on November 14, 2018. The Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on December 11, 2018, \n1 Also known as a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF86). \n2 The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \n03/18/2019\n\n \n2 \n \nscheduling the hearing for January 22, 2019. The hearing was convened as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified. The record was held open to permit Applicant to submit documentary \nevidence in mitigation. Applicant Exhibit (AE) A was submitted and admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on January 31, 2019. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 61-year-old staff engineer currently employed by a government \ncontractor since 2005. He previously worked for various government contractors from \n1979 to 2005. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1979. Applicant is twice divorced, and \nis currently unmarried. He has held a security clearance since 1980. \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant was charged with public intoxication in 2008; driving \nwhile intoxicated (DWI) in 2011; and DWI 2nd offense in 2016. Additionally, the SOR \nalleges he has consumed alcohol, at times in excess and to intoxication, from 1975 to at \nleast May 2018. Applicant admitted the criminal charges, with some explanations, and \ndenied the consumption allegation because it is overbroad. \n \nIn November 2008, Applicant was intoxicated after drinking at a bar. He was cited \nfor public intoxication as he walked to his car. The bar was about five miles from his home, \nbut he testified that he was only going to sit in his car to sober up. He pleaded no contest, \nand was found guilty and fined. \n \nIn May 2011, Applicant was drinking after work at a restaurant bar with some \ncoworkers. He drove to a fast-food restaurant and was stopped for a traffic violation. He \nfailed a sobriety check and a breathalyzer test found that he had a .12% blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC). He pleaded guilty in October 2011, and was sentenced to probation for \n18 months, required to attend an alcohol awareness class, and abstain from alcohol. He \nadmitted to making a poor decision to drive while intoxicated. In 2014, Applicant was \ndiagnosed with diabetes. \n \nIn March 2016, Applicant was drinking with a friend at dinner. He was intoxicated \nand caused an accident as he drove home. He was arrested and his BAC tested at .13%. \nHe claimed his low blood-sugar levels caused tunnel vision that contributed to the \naccident, along with the alcohol. He was placed in a pretrial diversion program, required \nto use an ignition interlock device for two years, and attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) \nmeetings. Applicant completed three AA open meetings per month for one year, and the \nignition interlock was removed in March 2018. He admitted to making a poor decision, but \nhe did not feel intoxicated. He also claimed his weight loss, no food, and low blood-sugar \nlevels while drinking contributed to the events that evening. He admitted that he has \nconsumed alcohol to intoxication on occasion over the past 40 years, and has at times, \ndriven while intoxicated without being caught. \n \nApplicant now drinks about once per week, and drinks to intoxication once every \nfour-five weeks. He does not drink at home, and uses a car service when drinking \n\n \n3 \n \nelsewhere. He does not believe he has an alcohol problem and has not been evaluated \nfor an alcohol disorder. He attended AA open sessions but not the 12-step program, and \nhe does not follow their advice to abstain from drinking. He provided a statement from a \nlong-term friend who has socialized with him. His friend stated that Applicant mostly \ndeclines to drink alcohol with them at dinner, and on the evening he was stopped for his \nlast DWI, the friend said he \u201cappeared to be carrying himself quite well\u201d about an hour \nbefore. His friend attested to Applicant\u2019s honesty, intelligence, and change in direction \nabout drinking alcohol. \n \nLaw and Policies \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865  \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \n\n \n4 \n \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \n \nApplicant has a history of excessive alcohol consumption and a resulting pattern \nof alcohol-related criminal conduct. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s history, as detailed in the findings of fact, indicates a pattern of alcohol-\nrelated criminal incidents between 2008 and 2016. He has admitted to a history of alcohol \nuse to intoxication, and has not substantially changed his behavior or seriously \nconsidered medical treatment or personal counseling. He attended court-ordered AA \nopen meetings and completed use of an ignition-interlock device as part of his diversion \nprogram. He has not adopted the AA 12-step program or stopped consuming alcohol as \nthey recommend, and does not believe he has an alcohol problem. He has not sought a \nmedical evaluation, diagnosis, or prognosis to favor application of mitigating conditions. \nHe continues to consume alcohol, at times to intoxication.  \n \n The record is devoid of substantial evidence of a change in behavior and efforts \nto ensure that no further alcohol-related incidents will occur. I am not convinced that \nApplicant recognizes the potential problem with his alcohol use, or that his alcohol \nconsumption is under control and that further alcohol-related incidents are unlikely to \nrecur. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply, and Applicant has not proffered \nsufficient evidence of rehabilitation and a change in lifestyle to overcome concerns about \nhis established pattern of excessive alcohol use. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \n\n \n6 \n \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Although adverse information concerning a single criterion \nmay not be sufficient for an unfavorable eligibility determination, the individual may be \nfound ineligible if available information reflects a recent or recurring pattern of \nquestionable judgment, irresponsibility, or unstable behavior. AG \u00b6 2(e). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a long-\nhistory of holding a security clearance, but also a long history of alcohol consumption that \nhas led to the exercise of questionable judgment. His history of alcohol-related incidents \nand his failure to show credible rehabilitation and a changed lifestyle, remain an ongoing \nconcern. He has not carried his burden to show that mitigating conditions should apply to \nameliorate the Government\u2019s concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \n  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \n \n \n_______________________ \nGregg A.

She obtained a high-school diploma in 2014. She has since attended college but had not yet earned a degree. She has held a security clearance since October 2015, when she enlisted in the National Guard. She has worked as a security officer for her current employer, a DOD contractor, since July 2018.

Applicant\u2019s parents immigrated to the United States from Senegal in 1991, before she was born. She listed on her October 2015 security clearance application (SCA) that her 72-year-old father, 61-year-old mother, 37-year-old brother, 35-year-old brother, and 33-year-old sister were Senegalese-born citizens residing in the United States as undocumented aliens. She testified that she has extended family members residing in the United States. She was unaware of the U.S. citizenship status of her aunts and uncles, but she knew that their children were native-born U.S. citizens.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn August 15, 2018, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing a single security concern under Guideline E \n(personal conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on September 27, 2018, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to an administrative \njudge on January 11, 2019, and reassigned to me on May 10, 2019. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 28, 2019, \nscheduling the hearing for June 17, 2019. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \n\n \n2 \n \n Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified and did not submit any documentary evidence. At Applicant\u2019s request \nand with no objection from the Government, I left the record open until July 1, 2019, for \nthe parties to submit additional documentation. Neither party did so. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on July 1, 2019. (Tr. at 16-21, 54-55) \n \n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted the sole SOR allegation. She is a 23-year-old, native-born \nU.S. citizen. As of the date of the hearing, she was single with no children. She obtained \na high-school diploma in 2014. She has since attended college but had not yet earned a \ndegree. She has held a security clearance since October 2015, when she enlisted in the \nNational Guard. She has worked as a security officer for her current employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since July 2018. (Tr. at 5-7, 8-9, 22-26, 43-44, 52-54; GE 1-2) \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s brother is a citizen of Senegal currently \nresiding in Applicant\u2019s U.S. residence as an undocumented alien. Applicant\u2019s parents \nimmigrated to the United States from Senegal in 1991, before she was born. She listed \non her October 2015 security clearance application (SCA) that her 72-year-old father, \n61-year-old mother, 37-year-old brother, 35-year-old brother, and 33-year-old sister \nwere Senegalese-born citizens residing in the United States as undocumented aliens. \nShe testified that she has extended family members residing in the United States. She \nwas unaware of the U.S. citizenship status of her aunts and uncles, but she knew that \ntheir children were native-born U.S. citizens. She also has extended family members \nresiding in Senegal, but she does not maintain contact with them. (Tr. at 31-38, 41-42, \n46, 48; GE 1-2) \n \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that she believed her parents began the \nlengthy process of applying for their green cards in approximately 2013, and they \nrecently received them as her mother has twice traveled to Senegal. She testified that \nthey intend on becoming U.S. citizens. She testified that her 37-year-old brother \nobtained U.S. citizenship through his then-spouse or children, and she informed the \nDOD background investigator of such in 2017. She also testified that her sister married \na U.S. citizen, through whom her sister was being sponsored for U.S. citizenship. (Tr. at \n31-38, 49-50; GE 1-2) \n \n \nApplicant testified that her 35-year-old brother, who is the subject of the SOR \nallegation, told her that he was a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) \nrecipient, but his DACA status was revoked as a result of his criminal involvement. She \nwas unaware of his citizenship status as of the date of the hearing. She testified that as \nof the date of the hearing, he had been incarcerated since approximately April 2019 for \nan assault charge that was pending trial. He was twice previously arrested: the first for a \nmarijuana possession charge and the second for a marijuana possession charge and a \nfirearm violation. She testified that there was an immigration hold on him and she \nbelieved he would ultimately be deported. (Tr. at 35-36, 38-40, 42-43, 48-52) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant listed on her SCA that she had been living with her parents since 2007. \nShe testified that she lived with them until February 2017, when she moved out to live \nwith a previous partner or on her own. She testified that other than when she was in \nhigh school, both she and her 35-year-old brother lived with their parents during only \none other occasion--an eight-month period from approximately 2016 until January 2017 \nwhen she could not afford to live on her own and they had to sponsor him as a condition \nof his probation for one of his previous arrests. She testified that \u201che was just staying on \nthe couch until he could figure out somewhere else to go.\u201d He then moved out before \nshe did and she has not since resided with him. She testified that she saw him daily \nwhen they both lived with their parents; she contacted him once monthly, primarily by \ntelephone, after they moved out of their parents\u2019 home; and she eliminated contact with \nhim after his 2019 incarceration because she did not want his criminal involvement to \njeopardize her career. (Tr. at 4-5, 15-16, 26-31, 35-36, 38-40, 42-48; GE 1) \n \n \nApplicant testified that her parents and sister are aware of her employment as a \nDOD contractor, and she was unsure whether her brothers were also aware. She \ntestified that she has not sponsored anyone for U.S. citizenship and had no future \nintentions of doing so. She testified that she did not have any unfavorable issues at \nwork, and she received an increase in rank in the U.S. military from an E-2 to an E-3 as \nwell as U.S. Army Achievement Medals. (Tr. at 40-41, 47, 50, 52-53)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15:       \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \n \n \nAs the youngest of three children, Applicant lived with her parents until February \n2017. For eight months, from approximately 2016 to January 2017, her 35-year-old \nbrother, whom she understood was an undocumented alien and who had been twice \narrested for criminal involvement, also resided in the family home, as their parents were \nrequired to sponsor him as a condition of his probation.  During that eight-month period, \nshe saw this brother daily. She then kept in contact with him once monthly after he \nmoved out of the family home in January 2017. He was arrested a third time for an \n\n \n5 \n \nassault charge and was incarcerated as of the date of the hearing. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(e)(1) and 16(g) are established.  \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n (e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \n \n \nApplicant disclosed this brother and her understanding of his citizenship status \nas an undocumented alien on her SCA and during her 2017 interview with a DOD \nbackground investigator. She credibly testified that she believed this brother was a \nDACA recipient, his DACA status was revoked due to his criminal involvement, she was \nunaware of his citizenship status as of the date of the hearing, and she believed he \nwould be ultimately deported after the completion of his trial for his assault charge. She \nalso credibly testified that she eliminated contact with him after his April 2019 \nincarceration because she did not want his criminal involvement to jeopardize her \ncareer. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(e) and (g) are established. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me \n\n \n6 \n \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the personal conduct security concern.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n________________________ \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n",
